__label__2,"Rose Dawson Malaysia: All must buy the album of Let's talk about love because it is very interesting.For your all information , I'd already heard the song of My heart will go on for 566 times.Believe me !!"
__label__2,"a precious resource for Christian contemplation: This book is the best one on Christian contemplation I've ever read. It is a perennial source of insight into God's love, without soft-pedalling the frightening consequences of sin. I hope to find it in print again, and will buy several copies right away for friends. Too bad about the price-gouging going on now: it's a wonderful part of any Catholic library but wait 'til there are enough used copies out there for the price to drop below the outrageous $250 or more for a copy requested by certain used booksellers. I bought mine for $31.50 two years ago,new. Hope that Loreto comes through in Jan 2006."
__label__1,"Rename it to ""RedSox, Yankees and Giants"": I've always trusted Ken Burns to make a good, fair documentary. Now I have to wonder if I was mislead on those other documentaries as well. I wasn't around for most of those times. I took his word for it. If his work was as slanted and narrow-focused as this work, then I probably was mislead. I remember the last 20 years of baseball and he blew it. Excruciating detail of every Boston-Yankees game and complete omission of other important baseball events. How do you talk about baseball in the last 10 years and not even mention Albert Pujols--ridiculous. But then again--that pretty much covers this piece of work."
__label__1,"Boring!: This game is based on a great concept but it falls short. The graphics are really bad and you have few control options. Pass up this game and save your cash for Roller Coaster Tycoon, Sim Golf, Space Colony or some other reputable, enjoyable game."
__label__1,"Lost in the 70's: The Eurovision song contest has come up with some good songs, but few are here. The song everyone knows ""Waterloo"" is on this album. I would say about 80% of the songs are from 1970's era. If you like that 1970's folk sound then you might like this album. The album does come with the list of countries the song comes from and how they ranked in the competition. There are a couple of winners in the bunch. My advice if you do not like the forienge folksy type of music then try another album."
__label__1,Joan Hart's acting drives me crazy: Melissa Joan Hart should have stuck with being a teenage witch. This was a pile of donkey doo doo. The most annoying thing about the whole movie was she and Britney remaking the song and her prancing around in that waitress outfit. The guy in the movie is UGLY. There is no helping an ugly man. And Melissa needs a makeover herself. I don't know why I am pondering so much over this film because it is literally ridiculous and worthless. Maybe that is why it is entitled Drive Me Crazy!!
__label__2,"A Very Funny Document: Vertiginous Falls Descend through Vast Frigid Domains! Vicious Flies Dart! Villainous Felons Destroy Valuable Fortress! Don't vacillate from despair, though! Various friends drop by, Violet fabricates devices, Klaus's vocabulary fathoms dilemmas, and as for Sonny: View Fine Dentition! In fact, the whole valorous family dexterously vanquishes foul designs.So, does the story come out all right in the end? Vexed. Foggy. Doubtful...This volume provides all the lugubrious fun that all the others do. And the words Volunteer Fire Department are spoken out loud, if I recall correctly, for the first time. (Darn. I felt sure that's what VFD was going to stand for - but now they've trotted it out three whole books of unfortunate events from the end, I must have been wrong. But whatever the mysterious answer turns out to be, I know our young heroes will face it with Virtue, Firmness, and Dignity.)"
__label__1,"Do Not Buy These Videos!: I thought the intro package was great, but it went downhill from there. The intro package has a long and short workout. The rest of the videos have only the long workout. In total I have 5 of these videos. They do mix it up with some dance moves, but many, many of the the moves are march-in-place- repetitive. DanceSport LLC customer service is TERRIBLE! It took them 3 tries to get my address corrected. I sent back a duplicate product but they never did give me credit for it. Kept me on hold for up to 30 minutes at a time too when I had to call; and I had to call at least 8 times!"
__label__1,"Will be great later: I bought these diapers for my 2 month old after reading great reviews. The infant size is listed for 10-22 pounds, which is quite a range in weight. My daughter currently weighs 13 pounds and these diapers are just enormous on her. I pulled them up as high as they would go (nearly to her armpits) and the leg holes were still gaping around her thighs.I do think these will be fabulous once she is a little bigger."
__label__2,"tells you the hows and whys throughout different times and cultures: love this book! want to know why one should eat something? you will find it in multiple places from multiple sources. the recipes, too, are working for my family. nothing like raw yogurt! can't wait to get into the other more off-beat recipes like beet kvass!"
__label__1,"Please, please finish!: I have struggled through this book only because of stubborness and determination. It goes nowhere, addresses nothing, has no action and resolves nothing! For slow reading and lack of interest, I would definitely rate it a 5.I will wait for the reviews before I buy another book in this series. Perhaps it would be best to save your money and not buy Crossroads. Just skip to Book 11 (assuming that it is somewhat better)."
__label__2,"James Bond 007: Nightfire: This in its own right is the first game that truly gives the true bond expierence. I enjoyed it more than every James Bond game exept for Goldeneye. Every Bond game has lived in its shadow and so does Nightfire, but not as much as the rest of the bond titles. Goldeneye is the best bond in my opinion, but doesn't give the best impression of the charismatic James Bond himself. This game is more like a James Bond movie than a game and really develops every character and shows the side of James Bond as much as a movie does.Nightfire is about a Japanese based company that hopes in changing world government in favor for one government thatcontrols the planet with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and 007 of MI6 is the last hope for the world. The graphics are a ten out of ten. Pierce Brosnan looks almost real and the voice overs are really good. This is a very realistic first person shooter that no Gamecube owner should be without."
__label__1,"musical score: I really enjoyed the film so was looking forward to the music score. It was a bit disappointing, because it contained dialogue also."
__label__1,"Disappointing: I've read other Maeve Binchy books (""Scarlet Feather"" and ""Evening Class"" were my favorites) and found them very enjoyable. This one started out good but gradually deteriorated. It just didn't have any direction and really fizzled out at the end. In my opinion it was really disappointing."
__label__2,"BLAZING!!!: Wow! This horn driven band has really done it with this new release. When I put it in the player, it practically melted. Their music found its way into my bloodstream...an addicting, infectious groove to say the least. Do yourself a favor...check out the sound samples online...you'll be convinced....Foxtrot is for real."
__label__2,"Enjoyed every page!: Buy this book NOW--because if you don't, you'll forget about it and miss out on one of the great humorists of our time. After you read this book, you'll want to call up Sheri and ask her to be best friends. She's likeable and funny in a not-obvious-humor sort of way. She's got true wit, and she dishes it out chapter after chapter. Each of us has a laugh-out-loud synapse in our brains, and Sheri hits it again and again. But most importantly, when I turned the last page, I felt I had become a little more laid back. Sheri makes you realize that the things we think are super-important really aren't as super-important as we think they are."
__label__1,"alright already: I did not finish 'White Noise'. After about 60 or 100 pages I began hearing a little voice saying, ""I think I get it"". But hammering away at a not very complex point is only one of the book's annoying faults. The book makes the point that there's a lot of useless information that can take up space in our minds over and over and over. All the characters, incidentally, had virtually the same voice; the 14 year old used the same cadence and vocabulary as the college professor. The book seems to be targeted toward mental masochists that enjoy or are, perhaps, proud of the 'head-full-of-crap' condition. In this way the book is a condemnation of a certain kind of liberal arts education. If the condemnation is unintentional then I feel sorry for the author and the reader. If it is intentional - alright, already."
__label__2,"A Masterpiece in the Tom Wolfe Fashion: This book which appeared twelve years after ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" takes up a similar story and shows that Tom Wolfe has not lost the plot as is the case with some other writers. In this book, the struggle and the decline of a self-made entrepreneur Charlie Croker is told in the Tom Wolfe style. He is great in producing strong novels with all life size characters. As always, one comes across some of the funniest and wisdom-packed writing in the English language."
__label__2,measurements varied: very useful for measurements variedI would like to replace the retaining ring by a rivet system as in kits for identifying gauges using each teaspoon
__label__2,"A childrens book that is a poetic feast for all ages.: Pass It On is a beautiful picture book of some of BlackAmerica's best poems for children. Here the reader will find examplesof the wonderful works of Langston Hughes, Nikki Giovanni, Countee Cullen, and about thirteen others. From the Harlem Rennaisance to the present day lovely thought-provoking poems are presented to the American child. The illustrations are muted but descriptive renderings that are melded together to present a picture of black life at its best."
__label__2,"At last, a book for the hobbyiest and professional: I found this book a real pleasure. Most woodworking books are written for the novice woodworker or the highly experienced. This book provides both simple and harder projects for the woodworker at both ends of the spectrum.The step by step pictures and explainations are such that a I had no problems in completing most of the projects. I have been selling these items with great success at the better Arts & Crafts shows as the items are truly unique and beautiful."
__label__1,"different: my customer buys this product and he say's this product doesn't work, i have mailed it back yesterday can you check the problem please because, it is not working. and i have ordered the same product. because my customers are important for me. so i have returned it, can i get my money back. so i can pay up."
__label__2,motion sprinkler: It seems to work OK but it is not constructed very well so I do not think it will last long. It would also be nice if you could adjust how long it runs when activated.
__label__1,Welcome to Fred: This book started out slow and continued slow and elementary for me. I read over halp of it and could never get in to it.
__label__2,"Great read: This is a nice book, I am only a few chapters in and have learned a lot about Arnold. Lots of questions answered, not surprising anymore why he was so successful."
__label__2,"Does Rogaine work: I have been using it for 6 months. Rogaine does work, but you must be patient and use it twice each day as directed by the instructions. I may not like the routine of applying it each morning and each evening, but if I want to keep a full head of hair, this is what I must do."
__label__1,Not what I expected: I was under the impression this was an all natural water-based lubricant with no glycerin as stated on an external site other than ecom. Sadly I was mistaken. There is glycerin and other not so vaginal friendly ingredients.
__label__2,"Absolutely MASTERFUL!: As with all Kurosawa I have seen, this film takes my breath away!An absolute MASTERPIECE. . . Also an absolute theft of Shakespeare's King Lear, but I assure you you will enjoy every second!"
__label__1,"Unwatchable: If you are interested in listening to professors talk in circles, then ultimately admit that quantum physics is impossible to explain, then this movie is for you. ""How far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?"" one of them says. Was he really quoting Alice in Wonderland?Let me sum it up for you: Thinking positively about a memory, event, or the future is better than thinking about it negatively. Wow, what a mind blowing concept. I think I learned that when I was 12 yrs old.Now can I go up to Rantha's camp in Washington and get locked in the place? I'd be happy to sign her contract not allowing me to leave the facility, use electricity, etc. I think I'll sit under the $100,000 chandeliers in the horse stables and ponder if reality is real."
__label__2,"Relief for my dogs!: I didn't really buy these for the shedding benefits. I was mostly looking for an omega supplement for my dog that was chewable, and not in a gel capsule. My dog had a slipped disc and was in constant pain. My vet said omega 3 can help with arthritis so I decided to get these. My dog also had itchy skin, and was constantly scratching, so I thought this would help with that too.I was pretty astounded when my dog's arthritis went away pretty quickly, within days. Also, my dog no longer scratches as frequently, and her fur is very silky now. I noticed the difference in her skin and fur rather quickly as well. I was pleasantly surprised since supplements can take a while to become effective. I would definitely not go without these anymore! This product has definitely provided much needed relief to my dog. Also, my dog likes the flavor too, unlike other omega supplements."
__label__2,"I liked it!: Comic book fans, check this one out, Jennifer Garner fans, check this one out, you'll appreciate a few scenes that show off her physique in the super-hero costume. the storyline on this one was solid and had good development. I heard some pretty bad things about this one and am not really sure why. I liked it and thought it was a decent movie and I plan to keep it in my collection."
__label__1,"Not worth the money: Paul Doherty was a much better writer before he started churning out book after book at maximum speed. ""The Horus Killings"" has irritating, ill-defined characters; a weak plot; and no real sense of historical grounding. I can't speak for the accuracy of the history behind this book, but Doherty certainly can't bring Ancient Egypt to life the way he can medieval England.So read some of the early Hugh Corbett novels instead, if you want a more accomplished and interesting book by Doherty."
__label__2,"Of course it has a huge Zeppelin vibe: The bands name and the person who started this project is John Bonham's son, his legacy for gods sake. The music is great and it does have originality. Why would you insult that, or that he was trying to get rich and steal his father's style. He grew up with it and it is in his viens. I feel John would be proud. I love ""Wait for You"" and know many others who do as well. And let's not forget to give credit to the rest of the band and Daniels vocals are spot on. Good for them. So stop trying to say thety are Zeppelin rip offs, just intensely influenced. And of course they would be. Hence the name BONHAM!!!Alicia from Connecticut, USA"
__label__2,"Cupid and Diana: Cupid and Diana by Christina Bartolomeo was a fast fun read. It is about Diana, a lapsed Catholic middle child who is trying to carve out a niche of her own. She has recently quit a secure job to open a consignment shop, found lust with a man other than her fiancé and maybe love and is in the process cutting some painful family habits. It was a fun read with engaging, likeable characters and a great love story. I can definitely recommend this as a relaxing Sunday read. It is worth the price as a trade size paperback but not necessarily in hardcover."
__label__1,"There are much better beginner's books available now.: This is an old outdated book. It is slightly better than some of the original beginner's books by Laskey, Smith, and others. There a far better books available. Janice Kim's ""Learn to Play Go"" is an excellent example. Please note that I have the greatest respect for Iwamoto. His book was the best English language beginner's book when it first appeared."
__label__2,FANTASTIC !!!!!!: This is the MOST wonderful uplifting music I have ever heard !! Whenever I am down ~ this lifts me up and I can feel the spirit of the Lord !! AMEN !!
__label__1,"Would love to comment on the quality...: ...however, when I opened the package, there was no DVD-A disc in the case! You have no idea how disappointed I was. I shipped the empty case back to ecom today (along with the packaging, which didn't look original) - $4.00 out of my own pocket. Oh, and the booklet inside was bent/scuffed. This DEFINITELY didn't look like a new product to begin with.FOR SHAME... I shouldn't have to pay to return an item that I never received in the first place. I will amend the review when I receive the actual product, and after I see how ecom handles this whole situation. Not looking good so far.FWIW, DVD-A cases do not fit in the different CD-size mailing envelopes from UPS or USPS. I had to step up to a larger size, and of course, pay more."
__label__2,"Works for me...: Can't speak to the science behind it but truth is; it seems to work for me. If you have muscle pain or maybe bruising it might be worth a try for you. Notes: It doesn't heat up or sting or even get cold it just goes on like lotion (no smell/odor) but seems to over time work. I usually use it for several days after a sprain in my wrist or getting some level of bruising and it gets better and is less painful. Bottom line, I don't have any research I was just given some once to try and it seemed to help. Can't take Advil all the time so worth a shot was my thought."
__label__2,"Soft, feminine, and alluring: This is one of my favorite fragrances. It's a soft vanilla scent, though it isn't sugary or foody at all. It's very 'airy'. It begins a bit fruity-berry-ish, and then mellows into the skin as a soft vanilla, slightly floral scent. My boyfriend likes this one a lot, and always tells me I smell so good when I'm wearing it. The bottle is also beautiful. I'll wear a few spritzes in the morning, and it lasts almost until the end of a work day."
__label__2,klein crimping pliers: these are a great tool for my shop. we have 5 guys that use them all day long.much better than any other brand
__label__2,"Battlefield Guide: This book is an absolute must for even a novice civil war historian. My hobby is to visit WW 1 and 2 battlesites around the world. This book is in the class of the ""Stand Where They Fought"" guide series.Excellent campaign background descriptions, location directions, maps, and battle tactics with the significant charaters included."
__label__2,"Very, Very Enjoyable: Any but the staunchest, most purist fans of the series are pretty much guaranteed to enjoy the film. Though it does play a bit more like 'The Further Adventures of Mulder and Scully', it is very well written, very well acted, and at times, very poignant; I honestly don't feel it promised anything it didn't deliver. As far as series that have crossed over to the big screen go, I would put it in the same league as 'Serenity', and If you missed it in theaters in light of all the questionable reviews, you've got a second chance. And yes, the final credits sequence is very sweet and thought provoking."
__label__1,"Not worked!!!: Yes, It is a nice price and we tough that it will be good, but it's cheap and regret it having it, after 7 month or little more this whole set star been very uncomfortable to have breakfast or dinner, it move like it was going to break and make me feel very bad, i do have a teen 13 year old boy and 5 year old girl nd trust me they did not make it like that.so it is a pice of a ""COLLECTION"" you buy it don't use it if you want to have a nice pice. of....... i contact seller they dint want to do nothing for 30 days guarantee.so now i do have to buy another one for double or triple of that money.... make number and i am screw...."
__label__1,Negative stars actually. Scratches IPOD: This thing WILL scratch the surface of your IPOD. It scratched mine :( BEWARE!
__label__1,"Great phone, unless....: You want to call someone. I was prepared to love this phone from the start. Almost everything about it was exactly what I was looking for save one thing, reception. I've owned about ten different Nokia phones over the years and the 8801 was by far the worst when it comes to the cell phone's most basic function. My trusty Nokia 6610 comfortably showed four bars and excellent reception of the Tmobile GSM system. A swap of SIM cards yielded a fluttering one bar on the 8801 at best. If you're considering this phone, make certain you have strong reception in your area. You'll need it."
__label__2,Thee Best Season By Far!!!!: This DVD will be under my Christmas tree from myself hehe. Undoubtedly the best season ever. So much happens and so many surprises! I didn't know they let Kevin Williamson go after this season and it definitely shows in the later seasons but still one of my favorite shows. Bringing back past characters and bringing in new ones was an excellent idea and done very well. The last episode is a shocker I thought and will leave you begging for season 3 to come out.
__label__1,"Great start; sluggish finish: This is an ""alien object approaches solar system"" story. The begining, involving an accidental collision of a shuttle craft with an earth-orbit space station is quite good. The set-up of the two main characters, Alis and Karl, is done quite well. Things go downhill from there, however. The two are reunited by chance in a survey ship near Pluto, when the alien object comes onto the scene. The plot drags as the team sent to investigate the object stumbles through a series of mishaps. The characters, particularly the supporting cast to the two principals, are petty and peevish. The conclusion is painfully obvious. If you want to read about alien objects, Greg Bear's ""Eon"" or ACC's ""Rendezvous with Rama"" are much more fulfilling."
__label__1,Non repairable junk: My Polaroid unit lasted about 7 months. Then the picture just went out. The warranty was for six months. I couldn't get anyone to fix it so it went in the trash.
__label__2,Coldplay's X and Y: Really love it and I love Coldplay. It ranks right up there with A Rush of Blood to the Head.
__label__1,"Not bad--but not great, either: I found this book to be interesting in that the author addresses numerous issues that most writers would not dare to address in terms of African American race intra-relations. Unfortunately, she does a poor job with analyses about her own self-perceptions and choices she made in terms of dating and close relationships. It's evident that she grappled with how she fit in the broad scheme of things (i.e., the BLSA at HLS, other African Americans in the Air Force, etc.), but the book offers little closure on these issues, really. I would recommend that the author take notes from ""White is a state of mind"", by Melba Patillo Beals. This author fully addressed her choice to marry a white man, internal struggles with regard to relationships in general and men in particular, and choices she made throughout her life as it related to her career, etc. I really enjoy memoirs overall, but Dickerson left me hanging."
__label__2,"Finally...: Finally a show on basic cable that is just as good, or better IMHO, than HBO or Showtime. I love horror movies, especially the psychological/suspense genre. I watch every horror movie that comes out, so I'm pretty desensitized to scary things. But, this show actually scared me! Scared like hiding my face under the blanket and yelling at the people on TV ""don't go in there"", ""don't go that way"". Love it, love it, love it. Better than any scary movie I've seen in years, so it's awesome that it's on TV. It's like a great movie that doesn't end after two hours. I really should knock on wood. It seems like every time I really love a TV show it gets cancelled. Or maybe my tastes are just more refined than the majority! ;) lol"
__label__2,"Great value/ Check for chipped cutters: I've used these cutters on several projects now and I really like that they are adjustable since it seems that none of the plywood/melamine on the market seems to be consistent in thickness. This makes for a nicely fitting drawer bottom or door panel, but as others have said about 90% of them come with chipped cutters due to their poor packing."
__label__1,"Terrible Re-recording: This is actually Mark Lindsay re-recording his own solo hits and Paul Revere and the Raiders hits. Sounds terrible, not much like the originals. I threw away the CD. Anyway, looking for these songs should stick with the originals."
__label__2,Pleasant and Interesting: Great video footage and a good narrative to showcase Washington State's Olympic Peninsula. Not sure when it were actually filmed because of the 80's style haircuts and clothing of the people.
__label__2,"Excellent Condition: I ordered this text for a college class thinking it may be late, due to my lingering on the ordering......Ordered beginning of the week and it was here by the end of the week.New Condition, Excellent Shipping, A++++++"
__label__2,"Tobacco Road: This book is in good shape for its age. I've already watched the movie, and so far, the book is very similar."
__label__2,"wsouza: This is a great game that kids and adults can safely play. The poles do not have to be stuck in the ground, they have stands. Every thing is rubber, plus it will have your kids playing outside and not sit around playing video games. They can have fun and exercise outdoors."
__label__1,Not a complete product: Ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information. Was not like the picture. Returned 1st one and ordered a second which was identical to the first. Also was returned.
__label__1,"Not up to the usual HPS standards: There may be a game in there somewhere, but I couldn't get past the 1980's era graphics. Much better alternatives out there for this period wargaming."
__label__2,"great sleeve: Excellent sleeve. The interior is soft cloth to keep your screen scratch free. All you need is protection when in a bag or transport to prevent scratches. It is much better all those other snap on bulky covers. The tablet has a great feel already and looks great. Now a days, everyone is constantly putting ugly cases on every phone/tablet, you can never see how great the tablet looks. This provides protection with a sense of style."
__label__1,Toni Braxton: Very disappointed in this CD. Not the best I've ever heard. Won't be buying any more of her music.
__label__2,The War with Grandpa: I think this was a great book. My favorite part is when Peter stole Grandpa's false teeth. My least favorite part is when grandpa pull's all those dirty tricks on Peter. All together I think you will like this book.
__label__1,"Not my favorite: I am only 15 but I have read almost all of JG's books and I dont feel this is one of his best. I think this one was not very likeable for me because is it not likely that a high profile lawyer would give up all he is getting for a low paying job working for the homeless. I believe this is not even close to as good as ""The Rainmaker."""
__label__2,"Comprehensive guide to ski touring in the Tahoe ares.: My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives. This book is not just for winter. Many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips. The descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded, but the route information itself is first class."
__label__2,Found the last of discontinued CD2 Mixer: Numark stopped making this inexpensive item which I was thrilled to still be able to find on ecom.comIt is a simple dj player for both CD's..MIXER built in and you can connect your Computer DJ player as well..cant be beat....DJ Steven SInger
__label__1,Already stopped working: This is the second Motorola HS850 headset I have purchased and both stopped working after a short period of time. The very first Motorola HS850 I had came from a local office supply store and it worked for a very long time. These two I ordered through ecom have been terrible. They both started out ok and each one stopped working. The latest one lasted one month. I can hear on my end but the person can't hear me. I won't buy another one. I will fork out the money and buy one from the store. I thought I was saving money by ordering through ecom but it has cost me more in the long run.
__label__1,"Thin and cheap: These sheets are cheaply made. They have a weird texture, like paper. And they're so thin that they tore after only three washings. I am very disappointed."
__label__1,Disappointing: This book wastes too many pages covering general Grid Computing history and direction. Not enough detail on Oracle-specific Grid computing.
__label__2,"Better that Volume 1: It felt like this Volume 2 had more substance to it than compared to volume 1. I enjoyed watching it, and I think they put a bit more effort into the graphics and special effects, compared to the first volume, overall something worthwhile to watch."
__label__2,"Does what I needed it to do: I love to read on my porch but the glare made it impossible. The screen protector stopped the glare. It was easy to put on after the glass was cleaned...really cleaned. I had no bubbles, and have had no problems."
__label__2,Very Satisfied: We have been using this juicer for about a month. We are very satisfied. Easy to use. Easy to clean and maintain. Reasonably priced.
__label__2,Fate Sucks: Thomas Hardy has written a beautiful and tragic novel in RETURN. Fantastic story and ending once you get past the lengthy description of Egdon Heath. Breathtakingly powerful novel. A must read.
__label__1,"boring boring boring: I started to read this book and it lost my interest quick! I read the first 38 pages and never picked it up again. My friends agreed that its very repetitive & boring.There is many excellent parenting books out there, don't waist your valuable time on this one."
__label__2,"Documents Version 2 of the People CMM and describes practices for different maturity levels: The second updated edition of Bill Curtis, William E. Hefley, Sally A. Miller's People CMM documents Version 2 of the People CMM and describes practices for different maturity levels, explaining workforce development at each level and how to apply the framework of CMM as an assessment tool. Human resources and business managers personnel and college-level business libraries catering to them will find PEOPLE CMM packed with tips on a structure broadly adopted by small and large organizations around the world."
__label__1,Disappointed: Several videos hang up and the sound is not the greatest. Disappointed with this product I am happy with most of the items I buy at ecom but not this time. If I was going to buy again I would buy each movie separate not as a special package of all 5 movies together.
__label__1,"This is a ""Teaching"" workbook? My 7 yr. old found 2 mistakes: My Daughter (7 years old) found two addition mistakes on her own in this workbook. I emailed the Learning Horizons company to inform them about the errors, and also to let off a little steam at how disappointed I was with their quality of a so called education aid.Just thought anyone interested in these series or the brand in general should be aware of these pitiful attempts of a teaching aid....Have a nice day!Sonny*Daze"
__label__2,"Go Trekkers: I actually bought this for my husband, who is a trekkie through and through. It is going to be a gift for his 50th birthday and I know he is going to be tickled with it."
__label__2,"A great album...: Bob Forrest has a voice that lulls you into thinking all is right with the world even while he's singing about how sick the world can be. The best song by far is his own ""BiPolar Lovesick Blues"" which could be an anthem for a generation of people who continually attract and are attracted to the one person who is all wrong for them. His remake of ""Louisiana"" is heart breaking while ""Melt With You"" is surprisingly seductive. I'm starting to listen to some of his earlier work with bands like Bicycle Thief and Thelonious Monster and can't believe I missed out on such a unique singer/songwriter in the two previous decades. Buy this album,and you won't be disappointed."
__label__1,"Garbage...: I really consider korn to one of the worse bands and im also talking about their first cd which was terrible too and i dont know why people thought that korn's self title album was their best ? All of their albums are terrible period! I have listing to this in the cdstore because i knew they werent going to do noting for me so thats why it was given zero stars from me! There's no good songs here and if you want to be bored to death buy it but if you want some good music skip it!!!! Insted go for deathmetal because that's real music not this talentless nonsense... I would beg you guys not to go buy it but i know most of you are 13 year olds and nu-metal idiots with brainless music taste,that thinks korn as well as limp bizkit,linkin park etc... Are all good bands! Support deathmetal and leave the trash where it belongs!"
__label__1,Engineer: The solder attachment does not heat up enough to melt solder. So don't buy it if you want to solder. It does have a good flame though.
__label__2,"Spiderman Trilogy [Blu-ray]: This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!"
__label__2,"Love this!: I have had Carcassone for a long time but no expansions. The expansions have made this one of my favorite games all around. I got 4 expansions all at once and usually do combinations of 2 different expansions each time we play. Traders and Builders is my favorite expansion followed by Abbey and Mayor, then Inns and Cathedrals. I still need to implement Princess and the Dragon in sometime."
__label__2,"Awesome: I honestly didn't expect to much from this purchase considering the price, but I was very surprised at the quality of this cable. Insulation is very good. I have this running from my pc to my stereo and it sounds perfect, no sign of distortion, even with it running over adapters and power cords."
__label__1,"Feels sturdy, didn't last long: This is not a good product. The connection would drop, and after only a few months it stopped working entirely. Avoid!"
__label__2,"Interesting: We found this book okay to read, it was interesting enough to read and report on but it could have been better. The parts we liked were when Mr Griffin died and when susan was tired up. Betsy was our fave character."
__label__2,"Put baby to sleep fast: I got this when my son was four months old and he is now 14 months old and still uses it to go sleep. He loves to ""talk"" to the fish and every night. He loves to push the buttons all the time to make it go. When he was younger the music on this was the only thing that calmed him down. It is very durable as my two year has unhook it and it fell on the floor and it still works fine. I would recommend this to everyone,the money is well worh it, and I know he will be using this for several more years as he loves this still."
__label__1,In the first chapter the Author says he is not a trader. I agree.: In the first chapter the author even says he is not a trader. I agree that with his statement that he is just a technical writer. This book is an interpretation of the Tradestation statistics (which you can get from Trade station). He tells you how to read the lab experiments. There is hardly anything to do with actual trading systems. If you read the title closley is reads Trading (BUILDING AND EVALUATING) Systems that Work. This is more about evaluation and less about building.
__label__1,"Non-standard bottles a pain.: This pump worked reasonably well for the price, but it is impossible to feed directly from the bottles because they are a non-standard size and no nipples are provided. I thought when I bought this pump that the bottles were the same size as the wide mouth Avent bottles, but they're not. I looked for nipples that would work with these bottles, but was unable to find any."
__label__1,"Read this book if you want to be terrified!!!: After reading this book I almost changed my mind about having children! It mainly focuses on negativity and the author gives you the impression that almost any horror of pregnancy is an inevitability. There are definite pros and cons to having an epidural, but Vicky makes it seem like your only intelligent choice is to have one. I would not recommend this book for a first time mom learning about pregnancy. I did not find this book amusing, nor did my husband."
__label__2,"Great product for the price!: This stand is well constructed, and gives your superior protection with the foam padding. I also like the rubber strap across the top. I didn't have any issue with smell like other reviews. I did have a small piece of plastic break off on the center post where it telescopes, but not really a issue since it doesn't touch the guitar. Solid stand for the price, and no worries about any scuff marks appearing on your guitar."
__label__1,"NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!: Very pretty when I first got it! I chose the magenta one. But the first time I placed it in the dishwasher, it came out with what seemed like bleach spots all over it. The pretty hot pink enamel is completely ruined. This would have matched my kitchen perfectly, but I'm now using it on my patio as a plant container."
__label__2,Witty and Intelligent: An amazing gift for anyone in physics but a great read for the layman as well. Feynman is so smart and tells his story in a clever tongue in cheek way that will keep you turning the page late into the night. Couldn't put it down!
__label__2,"Great Sound Quality: As a huge fan of Johnny I wanted to get as much of his catalog as possible in the best audio quality possible. Luckily much of his catalog is available in remastered CDs, but ""Listen"" and ""I Don't Want to Be Alone, Stranger"" are only available on these 2fers. There is another CD that contains both these albums called ""Lone Ranger"". I have yet to compare the sound of that CD with this one, but this one sounds quite good. It's clear that they went to the original master tapes instead of just a vinyl source, which I've encountered a few times.These albums are important chapters in JGW's career. After a string of blues albums in the 60's, he reemerged in '73 with ""Listen"" and established a sound that would carry him to his big breakout, ""Ain't That a Bitch"", all the way into the early 80's with ""That's What Time It Is"". This decade of music is the heart of JGW's catalog, and it starts with these two albums."

__label__2,"WORTH THE PURCHASE: I HAVE 4 OF LESLIE'S FAT BURNING WALK AWAY THE POUNDS VIDEOS.I HAVE BEEN USING THEM FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS AND HAVE LOST 2 ENTIRE SIZES.THEY ARE EASY TO FOLLOW AND ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THEM FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS YOU CAN COMPLETE THE ENTIRE TAPE AND REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE GOTTEN A GOOD WORK OUT.I JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED THE WALK AWAY THE POUNDS FOR ABS- 2 MILES. I DO THIS TAPE EVERY THIRD DAY TO BREAK UP THE POWER WALKING.JUST ONE NEGATIVE COMMENT. SOME OF LESLIE'S TAPES NEED ADDITONAL EQUIPMENT (STRETCHIE BAND AND WALK AWAY BELT)THAT ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TAPE. ONCE YOU RECEIVE THE TAPE THEN YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE AND ORDER AT AN ADDITONAL COST EACH OF THESE ITEMS AND WAIT ABOUT 2 WEEKS FOR DELIVERY.BUT OVERALL, I AM HAPPY WITH HER TAPES AND LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THEM EACH AND EVERY MORNING."
__label__2,"So Far so Good: I really haven't had this unit long enough to give an in depth evaluation of this product. For me it was somewhat difficult to set up. However, I have always had problems setting up VCR's throughout my VCR buying history. After consulting with a knowledgeable friend on how to kick this thing into gear, the unit appears to work very nicely. Once you understand the total setup, it is quite easy and simple to operate. I gave this a 4 star rating because I believe this VCR/DVD combo will do just fine. The only negative is that it will only record to the channel you are watching. For the price however, I can live with that."
__label__1,"Great if you are easily entertained and satisfied: This DVD is a great example of how Hilary gets by on her looks. Includes making and videos of ""So Yesterday""/""Why Not"", and a short version of the video ""I Can't Wait"". Includes home videos and photos of Hilary when she was younger, and less annoying. As far as Hilary in the studio, it includes performances of ""Little Voice"" and ""So Yesterday"" which are both lip synched, as anyone who has common sense could tell that. They also show bits of performances of some other songs on her album, also lip synched. So you see no live singing here. Just Hilary faking it."
__label__2,"VERY Impressed with product & service!: I purchased a pink Tiffany style lily lamp from Lamps Plus. It was my first time ordering from ecom.com. It was a super simple process to order. I instantly received confirmation from both ecom & Lamps Plus. Received a tracking number within 2 days! Package arrived quickly & very well packaged. It is beautiful & the quality of the lamp is very good. Received information on warranty & returns with purchase. I am very happy with this purchase beginning to end. Lamps Plus offers hassle free, proffesional speedy service & a lovely product! I would definatly buy from them again! Thank you & Happy Holidays from Washington State!"
__label__1,"One of the worst books I've ever read: How can a book with such a beautiful alluring cover be so horrible? I'm sorry to say it, but this book was one of the worst books I've ever read. When I finished reading it, I had this sick upset feeling in my stomach. I wasn't sure whether I should scream or cry. Although I did neither, reading this book, I'm sorry to say, was a dreadful experience. The part about the jaguar in the dinghy was cool but the ending was terrible. I was disgusted that the main character was mean enough to split an innocent dog's head open for absolutely no reason. I also hate the name Max. You could have picked a better name. Although, you have taught me one lesson; don't judge a book a by its cover. Even a book with a great cover could be awful."
__label__1,"product activation annoyance: there's the annoyance...apart from that a good OS...never crashes, rarely gets unstable. New media player doesn't like MP3's downloaded from the web (a piracy measure it seems)...Okay for home use...absolutely useless in a workplace.Suggestion: buy XP pro if you must have windows... Or download Mandrake LINUX...:) for free..."

__label__1,PALINDROME: READING STEWART WOODS BOOKS HAS BEEN A PLEASURE TILL THIS ONE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE.
__label__2,Useful for illustrating the properties of light: I have used this product in my classroom to illustrate that white light can be broken down into the colors of the rainbow. It does a nice job of doing that as long as I can get the light to hit it at just the right angle.
__label__1,"I am still a Vista Dummy: Although I got a few tips out of this book (how to make the start bar appear as it did in Windows XP), I found very little useful information. This would be a great book for someone who is brand new to Windows, but I expected it to have more information about converting."
__label__1,"Terrible toy - elevator doesn't work: This Christmas gift was a huge disappointment. We own another Quercetti Marble Run that we've had for 7 years and love, so picked this one out as an addition to that set. The kids (ages 10 & 4) were mostly interested in the motorized elevator. Well ... We worked on this for an hour and can't get the elevator to work right. There seem to be too many links in the chain and it is too slack to work right with the cogs and pulley system. When we removed a link, then it was then too tight and pulled the supporting tower over every few seconds. the red ""cups"" that carry the marbles up to the top also kept catching on the supporting base structure and falling off. NOTHING seemed to work right with the elevator portion of this toy ... Which is why we bought it. It's too expensive to just keep just to use as an addition to our regular set. This will be in the return mail tomorrow."
__label__1,BUY THE CD INSTEAD: The sound quality is lacking a great deal. The cd of the concert offers better sound quality but on the upside this contains the original videos for the last 3 songs and the video quality is good. My advise is to buy the cd.
__label__1,".026 string does not fit the nut on my ESP guiutar: I tune to C, and I usually play Ernie Ball power slinky strings (.011 - .048). I wanted to try a set of 12's. I put the strings on my ESP strat-style guitar. The .056had a very hard time getting through the tuning peg on the headstock. The .026 (3rd string, Eb in C standard, G in regular standard) does not fit in the string slot on the nut. I spent a few days adjusting the truss rod and intonation for these new strings, but they sure don't work well with this guitar. A buddy of mine uses them on his Jackson King V with a Licensed Floyd Rose double locking system and loves it.These would be good on a baritone guitar, but not on my guitar. Gonna try the Blue Steel strings (11 - 52) next. Might end up going back to the EBPS 11-48 set again."
__label__1,"DOA: I take pride myself with being good with plants. I tried these because I like the idea of having them grow in the kitchen window. To put it simply, save your money. Only the sweet basil grew and it was stunted and barely there. Lesson learned. This was a high price for 3 pots and some DOA seeds."
__label__2,"What a great movie!: I had heard the hype about this movie and decided to give it a chance. Boy am I glad I did.This movie has a great cast, with great acting. Great filming. And a fantastic convoluted plot that turns and twists until the bitter end. I have to say, I haven't seen such a cat and mouse pursuit in quite some time as what the characters portray here.I really don't want to give too much away except to say that this is a must watch film. You have to pay close attention, but it is well worth every minute."
__label__1,"A smashing present: The gift of 4 glasses, delivered to the door of my brother's new house in Philadelphia was going to be a lovely home welcoming. Unfortunately there was very lttle packaging around the glasses and 3 were smashed on delivery. Not a good experience. I won't be back."
__label__2,"Old people, listen up...: If you are old, and maybe dying, I have just one thing to say to you: YOU CAN'T DIE BEFORE YOU HAVE READ THIS BOOK! HURRY!"
__label__2,A great film from a great generation.: I pretty much grew up in the late 90s and 00s but all the horror/thiller films/shows I watch thoughout my growing years were lame. I find that the old horror films have so much more 'substance' and much more 'eerie' feel than all these new horror films that get too deep with the plot and just mess up the whole movie. This one is no exception. It's not too scary as much as just a classic horror story.
__label__1,Sizing not accurate: Sizing was not accurate. Had to send back the medium and order a large for a foot that wears a size 9.
__label__2,"Finally, A Book I Can Use Daily!: I keep this book on my desk daily. I read the True Leadership Pledge ever day. I needed this book. It's filled with great stuff that I can use. It's great to read a book written by a man and a woman. I especially like the comparison of the Cubic Zirconia leaders and True Leaders. It's right on."
__label__2,"Great journal!: For those of you who like to see ""numbers on paper"" instead of on a computer screen, this is the book for you. Easy to capture your miles and other workouts on a weekly basis with this journal. This journal also goes hand-in-hand with the Runner's World Big Book of Marathon and Half-Marathon Training. Buy them both - you wont be disappointed."
__label__1,Nice try still no cigar: This appears to be a big improvement and believe me I have been waiting for this to come out and it is ALMOST there:Still need to improve priceWhat is with this 10 cents a down load. The phone company stopped charging by the call long ago. This looks like a trap.Need to improve the compatability to work with all systemsReduce the border increase the screenColor - I still have my green screen monitor but I haven't turned it on in a while.
__label__1,I hate and will be sending it back.: Horrible picture with faded colors no matter what adjustments you make to the television.
__label__1,"The Amityville Borer: Frankly the only disturbing thing about this book is the idea that anyone actually thought it was real. The plot devices used were idiotic and ranged from marching bands to devilish pigs to MacGuffins like a moving statue. I know some of the band dorks in highschool can be pretty creepy but are they really horror material? And why drag poor innocent Babe into the melange of infantile horror props? Was swine flu not scary enough? What's next? A demonic icecream sundae whose cherry topping has ""mysteriously"" disappeared. Maybe the ghost of Ronald Defeo ate it.If you are looking for a creepy book pick up ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson; don't waste 3 hours of your life on this one. Unless of course you are haunted by the dichotomy between books with moronic plots and excellent sales."
__label__2,"Very nice racket case: This is a great little case and an even better value for the money. I have a Stiga Ultimate paddle and was simply looking for something inexpensive to protect it. It fits nicely (snug but not too snug) and has a nice canvas cover.I give it four stars because the description claims to fit 3 balls in the zippered section, which I would advise against doing; it's way too snug. I carry a separate ball case made by Joola, which, surprisingly, was twice the price of this racket case. Ahh, marketing tactics . . ."
__label__1,"Not much RAC in this book: This book is somewhat of a misnomer. First it says it includes Oracle10g, yet there is none to be found. Moreover, at least one-thord of the book is basic Oracle and has NOTHING to do with Real Application Clusters. For example there are 10+ pages dedicated to STATSPACK, a non-RAC utility.I think if the non-clusters information was removed this would be a 150 page book. I feel somewhat mis-lead by the title, and the material is not worth the price."
__label__1,"Lack of forgiveness: I can't recommend this book. Although I thought it was well-written and beautifully illustrated, the ending bore nothing that I would want to impart on my children. I understand that part of the lesson was that gossiping can be harmful. However, the problem is that in the end Mr. Peabody couldn't just forgive the kid who gossiped about him. He's an adult, for goodness' sake! It may, indeed, be hard to fix one's mistakes, but forgiveness matters so much more than all of your efforts to right what you've done wrong. If Mr. Peabody would have shown the child grace, the story would be one worth reading. Since he does not, I highly suggest that no parent read this to their children. They may be left with a feeling of emptiness, fear, and confusion. Afterall, we all make mistakes. Is this the best way to teach children how to right their wrongs?"
__label__1,AWFUL!!!: Tastes like it was soaked in soy sauce and THEN smoked!!! This one hit the trash can the first night!!!

__label__2,Incredible: This book changed my life and I have recommended it over and over again. I met Dr. Crook and was able to tell him what his book had done for me. My son was a mess and today he has just finished his first year of college in Boston with A's and B's. The nutritional guidance is invaluable. Thank you!!

__label__2,"Magnificent!: I first heard Yanni's tribute concert aired on a PBS special. His music is absoultely phenomenal and composed with genius. Music is certaily one's way of expressing thoughts beyond human words and understanding, it's a language. Yanni has certainly infused these elements in his music, which doesn't fail to delight, not on any single track of this marvelous CD. Whether it's ""Deliverance,"" ""Renegade,"" or ""Nightingale,"" Yanni's music is mezmerizing and comforting. This CD is a must-buy for anybody who appreciates fine music and for anyone who appreciates the power music can inflict on the soul."
__label__2,Great Product: Love this lotion. It's main purpose is to moisturize my face. It offers both a smooth finish and helps in reducing wrinkles. I highly recommend this product.
__label__1,i wouldn't rent it again nevermind buy it: I was very excited when I saw this movie at blockbuster.It had good reviews and looked interesting.However; the entire movie was unbearable.At times I almost fell asleep and asked myself why I was even watching it.My dad actually did fall asleep.The bottom line is this film is overated and boring.
__label__1,"Broken straight from the box: I purchased the Cafe Roma (RED) through an ecom partner and thought I was getting a great deal.

When I returned, I finally unpacked it and it never even worked...and they wouldn't take it back :(I waited too long to act and now I'm out $225."
__label__2,Solves the problem of where to put the sensor: Nike shoes don't fit me right. So I was using a homemade pouch that worked but was sorta weird looking. This pouch is priced right and works great. A must have accessory for the nike iPod plus.
__label__2,"Oh, Willy: This book is classic Browne. A tale of transformation, the loser (Willy) becomes hero after a rigorous routine of hilarious self-improvement activies. Of course, he discovers (as do we all) that there are just some things about yourself you can't change.This book has been a favourite with every child I have ever read it to since I was first introduced to it in 1985. It seems to be a big hit with the kindergarten crowd and Browne's illustrations seem to be especially appealing to boys. A must-read."
__label__1,Fans can never be objective...: We've heard these songs a million times b 4...nice...but forgettable.
__label__1,"Luck of the draw: We bought three of these when our building's boiler died, and while initially we were really pleased, a month later two out of three of them have died. The first one was clearly not right from the beginning--every time we turned it on, it blew the fuse. Back it went to the store. We figured it was just bad luck, since the other two were fine. But this weekend I went to turn off the second one and felt a huge static-y shock when I touched the button. Later in the day when I went to turn it back on, the light went on but not the fan or heater. It's dead.The third one is still chugging along, so I guess it's ok, but the thermostat never really worked on any of them--we've just used the high/low setting.End result: Don't waste your money. There's no way of knowing if you'll get a dud."
__label__1,"not that impressed: I thought that I would love this video b/c of the reviews for it. But I found it a little bit too slow and boring, and not very challenging at all... it was alot of stretch and very little strength and I'm used to having a good combination of both from the yoga vids that I've done in the past. Unfortunately i'm very inflexible, and it's ever so tough to try to become more flexible which being pregnant so this video hasn't really gotten very much use of it. Also, someone else mentioned that the way she pronounces ""exhale"" is really weird and annoying... I thought the person who made that review was rediculous at first, and looking for things to pick at - but I was wrong... it was very annoying..."
__label__1,Tablets Are Too Big!: Very hard to swallow. Beware if you hate large tablets.Had to dispose of the product.
__label__1,"Didn't know it was Blu-ray: I guess it was my fault when ordering but I didn't know it was Blu-ray so I didn't play on my DVD unit hence the rating which I'm sure is way off base. I expected it to be at least a four star from me. I have the CD and have played it over and over again. Just wish it hadn't arrived as a Blu-ray. I really don't hate it as a DVD, just didn't have any other choice to write the review. If you have a Blu-ray, get it. I already know the music is great."
__label__1,"Road condition accuracy is completely unacceptable: As other reviewers have noted, some roads were poorly marked ""other state route or major connector""; when we got to some of these roads they were dirt, and labelled ""unmaintained"" and ""use at own risk"". In addition, I am fairly sure that some of the roads marked on the maps do not exist. We looked for a couple of turnoffs off SR 160, twice going back and forth where they were supposed to be, without seeing them.This inadequate accuracy made the atlas worse than useless, since it cost money and time."
__label__2,"Well Worth it: Exactly as titled! Backing tracks to play over... nicely done with a great booklet explaining suggestion as to which parts of the scales to use with each track and progressions through the track... You will learn from this book and even enjoy just playing to the songs if you already think you got your scales down pat...covers a variety of beats per minute and scales, great improvisation tool. Also includes the chords so you can eventually just team up with friends and play the whole song without the backing tracks.. I now own six from this series and they all are very well done and worth every penny."
__label__2,"Wonderful cd: This is a very nice cd to have home, it's the best way of introducing music to your baby. Amazing composers, great selection and the instruments used, made it easy for ""little ears"". It's a calming, sweet way of putting your baby to bed. Everytime I have time I turn it on and give a full body massage in my daughter... we both love it."
__label__1,"What were they thinking?: Ok, let's think of the most horrific event of our times and rehash it for the children.I just want to know WHAT were they thinking.My boy picked this out at the library because he loves all things cute and fuzzy. We came home to delve into a re-creation of hell on earth. My kids don't know about what happened on Sept. 11th, so for them it was just another book poorly written (especially when unbeknownst to them I'm editing and censoring on the fly, leaving key information out of the story...perspiring over whether brave mole would be going home to baby mole and how I'd explain that one). As for the kids who know what transpired on that fateful day, I say,""Why put it in fuzzy-wuzzy form and force them to relive the horror?""I understand the need to artistically express the pain and emotion of what happened, but can we not subject the kids to the wars of their fathers? At least until they can understand what it all really means. Ugh."
__label__2,"One of the greatest trance albums ever!: If you liked Robert Miles ""Dreamland"" ATB's ""Addicted to music"" and any album from BT you're gonna love this. It's a true classic. I first heard them in 96 when ""Seven days and one week"" was topping all charts in Europe. ""Flash"" and ""Desire"" were both simular songs. Not all songs are like that though ""Universal flash"" ""First & Second level"" sound like opera, they are instrumental like all other songs and beautiful just the way the are. ""Freetime"" is another favorite, it has a very diffrent sound then the rest. That's one reason why i liked this. You always get surprised by the diversity of this album. The fact that all songs are very artistic and wonderful to listen to, makes this album a real classic in trance music."
__label__1,"Negative 15 Stars: Damn I cannot belive I was stupid enough to buy this crap! Mondo Cane sucks! Mondo Cane 2 sucks! Women of the World sucks! Africa Addio sucks! Goodbye Uncle Tom sucks! The Godfathers of Mondo, well after all that I did not even watch it. None of these films are shocking they are stupid and boring. Mondo Magic is actually a shocking movie and is very well made. But these movies in both Vol 1 and 2, I was dumb enough to buy both, suck!"
__label__1,"GROSS - see Reese Witherspoon in Freeway instead: These two movies are so lame and there wasn't much else in the theaters when they came out which helped the box office success. These are tacky stories and not going to encourage anyone to knuckle down and do what needs to get done to get into a good school. Also, show your daughter Penelope which Reese Witherspoon produced."
__label__1,"Good for Sophomores, but not for those who have already given graduate school some thought: The target audience of the book is a sophomore or junior year audience. Thos e purchasing the book should be limited to people of that level in their studies or people who are only beginning to consider graduate school. For those who have given grad school a lot of thought: The book is a waste of time. Everything you already know is in there. The chapters have great titles but in the end they told me what I already knew.This book is in no way a complete guide to graduate school admissions. It seemed a bit infantile. But if you feel clueless, go for it."
__label__2,"One of the best purchases of my life!: This is an amazing product. I've had it for a year and no problems at all. You can use the strainer for loose tea, but I use it all the time without the strainer with tea bags, hot chocolate and coffee. Easy to wash and drink out of. It is absolutely leak-proof, very sturdy (not tipsy at all to be placed by a computer for instance) and the liquid stays steaming hot for hours. So impressive! People who have used it can't believe the heat retention. Buy it! A must for yourself and a perfect gift, especially in cold weather."
__label__1,"Not so great.....and no reference to Stephen Crane: I couldn't finish the book. Bad. And like the reviewer below I was disturbed that the title was taken from the Stephen Crane poem with no mention of him. The poem is below:In the desertI saw a creature, naked, bestial,who, squatting upon the ground,Held his heart in his hands,And ate of it.I said, ""Is it good, friend?""""It is bitter-bitter,"" he answered;""But I like itBecause it is bitter,And because it is my heart."""
__label__1,"Call Me Tipsy: Would have given this kit at least one more star if it had a handle that was usable and not prone to dump hot stuff on you or the ground. There has got to be an ""engineer"" who could put something like that together so it wouldn't be an accident that happens more often than not. (how about a set of ""grippers"" to hold the pan handle in place when it's open for use?) I've been practicing, but so far have not come up with a solution other than using a hot pad to steady the pan.Compact and light weight? Yes. Measuring lines on cup? Yes.As is, should be labeled: Use At Your Own Risk. Your Dog Will Love It."
__label__1,"Obsolete medium. Don't use this.: For heaven's sake. Go to wikipedia and learn that xD is an obsolete media no longer supported as of 2010. Sheesh. It was a proprietary media Olympus tried to make people use in their cameras, and it's slow and limited in size."
__label__2,"Good hatchet for the money: Took it to the Daniel Boone National Forest shortly after receiving it. Out of the box it has a surprisingly sharp edge, very impressive. Thanks to the composite handle and heavy head the balance is also excellent. The handle is smooth and short, definitely not capable of holding with two hands. If I could go back I would order the longer one. That being said, great hatchet for the money."
__label__2,"AMAZING: I personally thought of it as a very emotional battle between the Narnians and the White Which...ians. Well , the point that I am trying to make is that this movie should be watched by everybody IN THIS WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD, no I am just kidding, but you know, I do wish that everyone would do that because I know that everybody will love it, that is why I am trying to get my class to watch it, but I DON'T KNOW!"
__label__1,Just not the same: I was in the market for a new vac & have had 2 of these with extreme delight in the past 16 years. This one came broken and much to my disappointment I will not get another one. The factory non-800 phone line would not send me another belt to fix the one I received(already broken). They only said send it back or take it 25 miles to the service center. I will be buying something else.
__label__2,"A dark hard hitting drama: This gripping story about mixed up teenage basketball star Jim Carroll shows Leonardo Dicaprio at his cinematic best. With friends Mickey, Pedro and Neutron Jim swaggers around New York city like he owns the place. Their lives revolve around basketball and drugs and in the end it catches up with them all, leaving the penniless junkies battling to survive on New York's mean streets."
__label__2,"Silly Sorority, Fun Film, Great Extras: Julie Strain heads the most successful sorority on campus (yet it only has four members). These women are true man-eaters. But when it comes to actually dispatching the young men, it is Strain who does all of the dirty work.The sorority makes mucho dinero by selling meat pies on campus. They are very popular. Of course we know what they are really made of.The movie concerns Strain's move for greater power during a 20th anniversary and how the whole scheme might be coming undone.Veteran Brinke Stevens is excellent as a founding member bent on revenge. Her pouncing scenes have to be seen to be believed.The disk comes packed with DVD extras including home movies of Julie Strain and her sister acting rowdy, out takes, deleted scenes, extended scenes and more.A great B-Film with some classic B-Girls. Although it is had to believe that the ""young"" Strain in the flashbacks could ever have matured into the Strain we know and love is rather far fetched."
__label__2,"REVIEW ON FAMILY MEMBER WITH CANCER: One True ThingTHIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT THE VERY REAL ANGER IN A FAMILY TRYING TO COPE WITH THE CANCER THAT A MOTHER HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH. SAD, BUT VERY POINENT , A VERY TRUE AND HEARTBREAKING STORY THAT A LOT OF FAMALIES GO THRU ."
__label__2,"Great sturdy case for protecting discs: Have had no problems. It is a little heavy (steel, don't cha know), but very sturdy, well-sealed, and functional. The slide-clasp so far is working well, and I like it better than the push-clasp on the 12-CD version. It will be good for long-term storage."
__label__1,"...""we could not tolerate the cruelty associated with a meat-eating diet and we wanted to help end animal suffering""...: THIS IS THE #1 REASON THESE TWO LIST AS TO WHY THEY WROTE THIS BOOK.And it shows. Yes there are some interesting points made about artificial sweeteners and good carbs vs bad carbs...but over 66 pages in this 198 page book (then you hit the sources) are devoted to WHY YOU SHOULD BECOME A VEGAN and a rant on how the government is deliberately ignoring how we are being poisoned ...and then another 36 pages are daily menus, etc. so you can correctly become a VEGAN.This book was cleverly written - and parts of it are really funny. But if you are looking for a real diet book...and really don't intend to become a Vegan...this book is not for you."
__label__2,"Rockin' Hits: Needed some oldies for my MGB convertible when at the ""cruise ins"". Fit the bill. Thanks"
__label__2,"Roux temporary color: Recently, the hair along my hair line has been turning white 2 weeks after having it colored. Out of desperation, I tried the Roux dark brown which was recommended by my stylist. I'm very pleased with it and it stays in until the next washing. Like other reviewers have said, it has a slight odor but it lingers only a short time after being applied. It is a bit inconvenient to have to keep wetting the stick but it's necessary in order to apply the color. Once the color is on my hair I take a q-tip and rub it in some more so it's not caked on. The product is effective in covering much of the white until the next coloring."
__label__2,"Very Funny: The sound the toy makes (Ohhhhhh NNNNNOOOOOOOOOoooooooo!!!!!) when squeezed is very funny, and it's very responsive. I actually didn't buy this on ecom, but it's so good I wanted to make a review. The toy is also attractive and well built with good materials. It's actually don't use it for a dog, I use it at work to annoy people."
__label__2,"Fantastic value: After a long search for a charger for my Creative Zen Vision: M, I found this product. I was surprised (pleasantly) by the low cost and decided to take a chance. I have been very happy with how this works in my car and recommend it highly."
__label__1,Barcode?: I don't know why but I guess it was from a LIBRARY and had its barcode on it. I thought its quality was VERY GOOD.
__label__2,"HUSH: Noel, ""Arkham Asylum"" was written by Grant Morrison, not Neil Gaiman. The art was by frequent Gaiman collaborator, Dave McKean. Other than that, ""Hush"" is a great piece of work."
__label__2,"Fine product, but good luck receiving it: I have an indoor/outdoor cat who loves to roll in the dirt and pick up fleas. The spay works just fine. Does exactly what it's supposed to. You do need to plan your use of it though; the directions say to stay away from the treated areas for 24 hours. Also, the nozzle spays a stream rather than a mist -- not a show stopper but it's inconvenient. Note, however, that the folks who pack and ship it do a terrible job. I had to send it back the first time because the top came off and the fluid ran all over everything. The box was completely soaked in the pesticide. When the second one arrived, its top was just barely on. Had it jostled even a slight bit more in transit, it too would have run out and soaked the box and all its contents just as the first one did. To ecom's credit, they do make the process of getting the product replaced and the original one returned reasonably painless."
__label__1,Good Coffee...impossible to keep clean: This unit makes quite good coffee and the design is very attractive. However cleaning it is very time consuming and frustrating.
__label__1,"This was a bad choice for me: I loved this vacuum the first time I used it, it was quiet and powerful. But I quickly learned that if I did not take the whole vacuum apart after every use, it would clog and over heat, and turn itself off. I vacuum everyday and this vacuum was not up to the task. I tried to get the problem resolved through shark online, but hit a dead end there. I tossed it after three annoying months."
__label__1,"Not like the others - very irritating: Disks won't play in my parents' unit, which isn't even that old.Reduced image on our TV.Not happy at all, although I LOVE Columbo!"
__label__1,"Definitely Not A Bargain...: This product is definitely not as described and packaging was not good. The life-span of these batteries is comparative short. I did not expect their performance to be sub par, considering the 'Super Heavy Duty Battery Value"". I definitely would NOT recommend purchase/use to anyone."
__label__1,"A TV movie: Good hearted, but not even close to the laughter level of the best the brothers have done... Amid all the freaks was the altered Cher supposed to be real?"
__label__1,"When We Do Meet Again: The premise and logistics of time travel made sense, but it was a little shallow, not much depth to me. The proofreader was a little careless, as I found a lot of typographical errors in the book. I did enjoy the descriptions of the house."
__label__2,Works great!: This is a good product. I use it for my bamboo chopping block from time to time and it keeps it looking nice.
__label__1,"A Dissappointment: This is a shock only one new song here(that isn't even any good) and just a bunch of techno mixes if your into that sort of thing,I'm not and I'm sure most metalheads aren't. Save your money for the new Arch Enemy instead ,they don't sellout for MTV and radio."
__label__1,"not a Startech as advertised: This item was purchased because it was advertised to be a Startech - speecific application of a specific Startech USB to DB9 serial function was needed.The device that I received was an off-brand clone with a different chipset. The drivers included did not work, I had to download several different versions from other sources before finding one that actually worked. Had the vendor actually shipped a Startech as was advertised, this driver chase wouldn't have happened.Beware of cheap chinese clones masquerading as the real thing."
__label__1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM: KitchenAid is a brand name you can count on--usually. The rivet that holds this item together broke after a half dozen uses. I bought it because my kitchen is yellow with red KitchenAid but I also thought it would be useful. It was attractive but worthless.
__label__1,Come on - This guys a con man!: Get real everybody. This guy is being investigated for murder due to his greed and incompetence in the sweat lodge deaths.
__label__1,"Great if you like raisins and cardboard: First of all, these aren't vegan. I just assumed they were, with a name like SoyJoy. But that's my fault for not reading the label.Second, if you dislike raisins you should close this page now. Every single variety of SoyJoy bars contains raisins and boy can you taste 'em. Aside from a dry and tasteless crumble, that's about all you can expect as far as flavor goes.I've been vegan for nearly a decade, I eat pretty healthy and probably eat too much soy. I looked to these because they at least claimed to be not overly processed soy. After tasting them though, even if they were vegan, I wouldn't bother again.If you're looking for a tasty, healthy snack bar stick to Larabar."
__label__2,"A good add on for safety: We got this to add to our bouncy seat while our baby was still small. It definitely makes me feel more comfortable about putting the little guy in it so his head doesn't bounce around. I do wish it was easier to attach the two headrests together so they wouldn't slip down. That's what kept it from being a 5. Otherwise, it definitely serves it's purpose!"
__label__2,"Book Nitty-Gritty: A terrific assemblage: mid-century interior design and mid-century musings about the rich and famous.Handsome production from Harcourt Brace: oversized hardback, grey cloth over boards with a sewn binding; 2.5 pounds, color and b&w; illustrations throughout. Happily, there are many color renderings by Baldwin of his interiors."
__label__1,"aww shucks: the inside piece, where the cd sits, is made out of the same cheap clear plastic as the rest of the case. it is hard to remove (to put cd back cover in) without breaking it. it also make the entire cd case weaker"
__label__2,"Good sound, BAD lyric book: The backup sound is usually pretty decent, although it is true to the broadway version, in that there is much open space to allow the singer to ritard, etc. A bit risky for an uncertain singer. Some songs, such as This is the Moment, are a bit spare on instrumentation, but overall a fun and easy to use backup CD. Do NOT trust the lyric book, though- find the real lyrics online."
__label__2,"LOVE IT!: i bought this pair of earrings as a christmas present for my girlfriend and she loves it!!!! though there's a small problem... it's a little bit undersized, i thought it would be much bigger."
__label__2,"A tough life: I liked the book because it is from a true story and the story is fantastic. However, I disliked the book because it has a pattern of Ruth and James and Ruth and James and so on. Finally, I liked the book because it shows you how tough a woman can be in facing her life."
__label__1,"A fluff piece: I got this book hoping it would reveal ""the weight loss program to transform your life etc."" I found the book to be pretty light on the program part. There are a lot of tips from the contestants and from the trainers, but no real solid weight loss program and no logic or reasoning behind the tips that are given. Overall, I would only recommend this book is you are a fan of the show looking for contestant anecdotes. If you are serious about weight loss this book is not for you."
__label__2,Good buy: My parents freaking love it. Don't be shy... buy it now. DO IT! DO IT NOW!!!! That is all. Derp.
__label__1,"make it stop!: My coworker loves to slap this disc on from time to time and I have to say - it makes me want to jump out a window. What is it with this band? Every 'melody' is cloying and sing-songy, really irritating stuff. Complete pap. I'm a musician, I understand MELODY, complex melody, song structure, etc - i think this band smokes too much mary j to get down to serious songwriting. Same verse-chorus-verse garbage, silly lyrics, brainless chorus. Aaarrrrrgh! Please stop making records!"
__label__1,not the greatest: i suppose technically it works but it is awkward and not much better than just using a finger. Plus the cat sees it coming and knows what's next.
__label__1,Not DermaPet now Dechra: Initially I was sent the wrong product frm MedVet International. They sent APPLE SCENTED Malacetic Otic by DermaPet and I did not order apple scented. The color of the bottle was even different from what I had at home. I sent it back and received full refund due to THEIR ERROR. I placed another order with them and discovered DermaPet is now owned by Dechra. This product has an awful apple fragrance to it. When I wanted to return product I was told I had to pay for return shipping since this time they did send me the correct product. I researched it and found out DermaPet is now owned by Dechra and Dechra claims all ingredients in Malacetic Otic are same as DermaPet. DermaPet did not have this awful smell to their Malacetic Otic ear cleaner. I sold my Dechra Malacetic Otics to a friend to avoid return shipping costs.
__label__2,love it: This is a great series for those of you that didn't see it the first time around. It's also great for those of us that did.
__label__1,"LEAKY - terribly, leaky - even the new ones: Some of my Avent bottles leak, and some don't. My baby likes the shape and won't take any other shape (WAL MART made a great knock-off around 1999 - 2000, but don't make that model anymore, and the knock-off's did NOT leak, I still have them). Sometimes I can get one lid to fit a particular bottle without leaking, and I try to mark the lid and bottle with matching nail polish so that I can get an exact, no-leak match. But what a hassle! And the markings eventually wear off. I'm on baby 3, so I've got plenty of experience when I say these LEAK. I give it two stars, because the baby likes the shape."
__label__2,"another SWEEEET UT game!: Easily the best of the UT franchise, UTIII brings you top-notch graphics and even more intense, accelerated gameplay. In terms of gameplay, it includes all of the same game modes (CTF, death match, team DM, warfare, etc) from UT4, but with better vehicles, amazing graphics, and a pretty cool story. Of course, if you like the UT games youre probably not in them for the story : ) BUY this game! UT3 doesnt disappoint!!!!"
__label__2,Great House: Brought it for some outdoor cats & they love it.It is very easy to put together.Great price!!!I have ordered a warming pad for this winter for it.
__label__2,"Hot and sexy dance track: ""Don't Cha"" by the Pussycat Dolls is, simply put, a really great dance track. It's one of those rare songs that puts you in a good mood hearing it and makes ya feel really sexy out of nowhere.There are two versions of this track - the rap and non-rap edits. Stick with the better non-rap edit; the edit with the rap (Busta Rhymes is that rapper) is sloppily produced and lyrically vulgar.I don't understand all the negativity towards this song in the reviews - this isn't Dylan or the Stones, this is just a silly trashy fun song, nothing more or less. Furthermore (and I'm adding in my own opinion) seems most of the reviewers who took time out of their day to trash this record have rather questionable taste in music themselves....anyone who obsesses over death metal or whatever that is doesn't have a very valid opinion. Why are they here reviewing it to begin with?Bottom line, a song with a great hook that'll leave you feeling sexy and in the mood to dance."
__label__1,"Oddly Boring: I adore Radiohead, and really enjoy solo piano. I should love this disc, but I don't. Even though the wonderful creepiness of Radiohead is completely absent, I would be willing to chalk that up to artistic interpretation. But that's not what bugs me about this disc. What really bugs me is his style of playing. He relies on resonance and the transcript is completely devoid of silence. The result is a droning wall of notes, and all the pieces sound the same. It reminds me of Windham Hill recordings, but without the expression. Get Yorke's new album, Eraser, if you need a Radiohead fix, or get George Winston if you want solo Piano. I really wish I could recommend this, but I just can't."
__label__2,Fantastic value: My dogs enjoy this food and seem lively and excited to eat it. Very happy also that it's not made by Menu Foods - peace of mind factor is high. Great product!
__label__1,"5 Stars for the show itself, minus 3 stars for the glaring cuts: Not gonna go into detail. If you're interested in this, you most likely are familiar with the show. The show itself is great, but the cuts they've made are very frustrating for fans. I just wanted to lend my voice to this."
__label__2,Great Little Gadget: bought this because we make a lot of hard boiled eggs and i was getting tired of messing them up......some would be green and some would be a bit squishy inside.......with this egg timer all you do is place your eggs in the pot and put the egg timer in there right along with the eggs and cook.......the timer will change colors and when the color changes to the softness of the egg you want time to take the eggs out.........its that simple..........we use it EVERY time we hard boil eggs now!!!!
__label__2,"Kliban CatChristmas: Great, funny artwork. Kliban products are always a winner, whether it is his books or his calendars, they are always fun to have or give as gifts."
__label__2,does what it says: nice product. i'd recommend googling suggestions on how to use it properly so that you don't damage your skin accidentally. i wish i remembered to use this more often!
__label__1,"Rancid Smell: After using this a few times for pizza--it soaked some of the oils from the pizza into it. There was such a rancid--horrible-- smell everytime I went to use it. I tried baking soda, etc--to get the smell out--but to no avail--I through my out--would not buy another. It did get the bottom of the crust crispy. Too bad--nice product--but needs to be improved."
__label__2,"ugly is from within: sometimes in our lives we meet people who are just ugly on the outside because thier insides are ugly, but once you learn a persons ways and find out what causes them to be the way they are and begin to love them even though they don't seem loveable you will begin to see the change from ugly to beautiful. And this movie has taught me to be careful how I treat people with ugliness that shows outwardly,because all of us have ugliness in us and it takes a special person to show us how to let go of our selfish and ugly ways. To me this is what this movie portrays, that is why I love it so much and wish I had a copy"
__label__1,Not worthy of Wilton's name: This device is terrible! The teeth don't stay in the holder and keep falling out before you can even try it out on the cake! Don't waste your money!
__label__2,"It tells the story about a great Pharaoh and a strong woman.: It's the best book I've ever read! It's so fascinating and interesting to read and you get to know so much about the old Egyptian Culture. Furthermore this historic novel, or how you could call it, is full of passion and the characters are very strong and really impressive."
__label__2,Great Outlines: I've been using these outlines for over 20 years and purchased these as gifts for the Sunday School teachers at my Church.
__label__2,"16 Gauge: If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire. I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge. Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing. It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers."
__label__2,"Sun Tzu was right.: This is a better book than I first thought it was. On re-reading it, I realized that Collins was actually restating the principles set forth in Sun Tzu's Art of War: The devil really is in the details - those who tend to be successful are those who have the best understanding of the business at hand and have the courage to do what it takes to get the job done right.This book may be destined to be a classic, but it only builds on a tradition of applying rational principles to unravel what appears to be complex situations. It doesn't break new ground. Collins is not a Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Smith, Riccardo, Samuelson or Friedman, but he does a good job of showing how new challenges can be met by the application of intelligence and hard work."
__label__2,"Great in Shepherd's Pie: Swiss steaks are really good cut up and mixed with green beans or peas, a can of mushroom soup and the gravy...add mashed potatoes on top and you have shepherds pie! Better than the real meat version in my family's opinion!"
__label__2,"Best of a Classic: He may be old, but this is an exceptionally rockin slab of fun. One of the outstanding rockers of all time successfully translates his live show to the studio. Every song is dynamite, and very well recorded."
__label__2,NOT WINTER BUT SUMMER!!!!!!: I BELIEVE THAT THIS BOOK WAS GOOD AS A MUG WITH COCOA IN IT. THE TITLE WAS SIMILAR TO THE COLDEST WINTER EVER BUT THE STORY WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SUMMER AND WINTER IS JUST LIKE THE SEASONS NOT THE SAME. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND SUMMER PROVED THAT TO US. I CAN'T WAIT FOR PART TWO OF THIS BOOK. IF YOU FEEL THIS WAS THE SAME AS SISTAH SOULJAH'S BOOK I SUGGEST YOU READ IT AGAIN BECAUSE THERE IS A MEANING IN THE BOOK YOU MUST LEARN.
__label__1,"Can you say mid-life crisis?!: SO disappointing! I love Liz Phair--she has always seemed so talented and innovative...until now. I have worn out my Exile in Guyville and Whitechocolatespaceegg CDs, but this new album...well let's just say, you should look for several copies in the ""used CDs"" bin at your local record store. The only song that sounds like Liz is ""Little Digger"", the rest of it sounds like radio-pop senseless crap. I'm so disappointed. I hope Liz is happy with her new, Britney-like fans, because she will certainly lose her old fans if this is a sign of things to come."
__label__2,"It's good, despite what ecom and Spin say: I think it is a great album. It took a listen or two to realize just how great it really is. There are some songs on here that I absolutely get a crave to listen to. The selftitled album is one of the best discs around, but this ranks right up there with it, not as catchy but just as hard. I will forever be a Gravity Kills fan! What a terrific name, huh!"
__label__2,"A Very Nice Pack.: This is a very good size for everyday use, it's not a massive pack and your not going to haul a tent and three days worth of supplies in this, but it will hold a change of cloth's and some basics very easily, works well as a book bag as well and is perfect for an Ooh Spit Sack for the back of your car (I nice emergency pack.)a great deal for the pack, Made in India and of decent construction, it does get complicated getting all the straps attached correctly while empty, i stuffed a pillow into it to fill it out and it came together nicely."
__label__1,"Horrible: I am not Native American. I saw Dance me Outside and loved it. I wanted to see this series when it was on in Canada but i live in the USA, I hate this series and now I am stuck with this DVD. Don't buy this."
__label__2,"tweezerman shave brush: Upon arrival the brush is much larger than I had anticipated.During the first use, I did have to pull one or two bristles off my face, but other than that - it exfoliates really well and doesn't feel cheap. The amount of bristles make the brush very wide and they are almost too firm - but I imagine the more I use it, the more comfortable it will become. All in all, if you're looking for a brush that does what it's supposed to and you aren't incredibly concerned with how fancy it is - this is it! The price it right."
__label__1,"a bore: This is a VERY easy read that has a few very funny moments. However, it is a trivial narrative that only a baseball fan or someone who grew up in Long Island in the fifies would be captivated by. Too cute and with little point for the rest of us, but so short that anyone could give it a shot."
__label__2,"Dorian Gray: This movie is kinda hard to take, Dorian Gray is a tragic person that lost all for pleasure. The story was good but bad acting."
__label__2,"Great puppet: I bought the chef puppet last year while on vacation. Melissa and Doug make great, quality puppets at an affordable price. The chef puppet in particular is so good you might expect to see it on a TV kids show.You work the mouth with one hand, and his arm with the other. Definitely worth buying for kids of all ages."
__label__1,"never got item: I did not recieve the book I ordered. I am going to ask the seller where it is as soon as I finish here. I just found out yesterday, that it did not arrive to the person I sent it too. Very unhappy.Harriett Rash."
__label__1,"Christmas Miseries: I am an avid Streisand fan,so was very disappointed by this muchanticipated and longed for CD.The general mood of the CD is so depressing,that it makes you not only not want to leave home for the holidays but not even bother to get out of bed.Shubert's Ave Maria is the only track worth replaying.It's Barbra at her best.My major complaint is,Where's the cheer? These Christmas memories stir up depressions that usually follow,rather than preceed.It won't be something I'll play while trimming my tree."
__label__1,"At Least It Doesn't Weigh Much: I am grateful that this book is not very heavy, as I found myself carrying it around in my backpack all day yesterday. Other than that, I'm not exactly thrilled with this book. The recipes are indeed oversimplified and generally vague, and leave my wife (who grew up in a Filipino household) and I muttering, ""Wait, that can't be right...."""
__label__2,Wonderful If you just experienced a failure: I went to a series of financial problems and felt like a failure for a long time. Reading this book has helped refocus and I still have the courage to pursue my dream. It is an excellent reading.
__label__1,These Guys Are 100% Wussy Posers.: You know Joel Madden or whatever his name is is a complete wuss or Hilary Duff's mom would have never let her go out with him. I love how he tries to give himself street cred by littering his body with hillbilly tattoos and piercings. These guys suck. And I have never heard one of their songs... I am proud to say... and yet you know that my review is dead on.
__label__2,"Mistry Creates Realistic, Compelling Characters: The characters in this novel are so realistic and captivating, you will feel to compelled follow their daily lives in this excellent, heart-warming story. Mistry provides insight into the thoughts and actions of a middle-class,hard-working Indian family man with such depth, and the descriptions of the settings are so accurate and detailed. Every character, minor or major, has a story of their own and we see both sides of each conflict. Truly a must-read."
__label__2,"good product: cleans well, nice scent, please with purchase, would reccomend this product. - - - - - - - - -"
__label__2,"Isis pump: I had no problem using this pump. I found the instructions to be easy to read and follow. I was using an electric pump for several weeks and only getting 5-6 ounces a day. The first time I used the Isis pump, I got out 8 ounces. Since then, I've been able to pump out 8-12 ounces per day. This pump is more work than an electric one, but it really strengthens your forearms."
__label__2,"The Begining of the best Horror Series Ever!: Halloween is an instant classic. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleansance did the best acting. This movie is very mysterious, because you don't know why Micheal is going after Laurie. This isn't my favorite, though. Here's my best to worst: H4, H5(it was great), H1, H6(the t-cut! haven't seen p-cut) H2, H20, H8( wasn't bad.),H3 (it sucked)."
__label__2,"Lot's of Tongue-in-Cheek Fun: This is a spy/detective show with clever dialog, strong performances and sharp writing. It's a real pleasure to watch."
__label__1,"Mediocre: Georgi's book has its strengths and weaknesses. It is very strong on application to physics but suffers greatly from a lack of mathematical substance. It has all the earmarks of a mathematics book written by a physicist: lots of physical insight but poor logical structure. Clear definitions and statements of theorems are missing and contribute to the nebulous feel of the text.This is the kind of book that a casual reader will go through and think he has learned alot but for which the serious student who seeks a precise, thorough understanding of the material will likely end up confused at many points. It is a book of tools. The reader will not obtain a mastery of the subject but must suppliment this book with other, more theoretical treatments of representation theory.The lack of mathematical rigor is by design as Geogi mentions in the preface. It could have been a better book, in my opinion, had it been more fleshed out in that respect."
__label__1,"Embarrasing: I find it difficult to even write this review, given the fact that there isn't an option for 0 stars.This CD isn't even worth the print if it doesn't carry at least -some- of Silvestri's work on it. It doesn't, so it's horrible. Stay very far away from this synthesized piece of crap."
__label__2,"My One Year Olds Love It: We have about ten of the Veggie Tales videos, and my three one-year-olds seem to love this one second best (after Rack, Shack and Benny). The song ""I Can't Believe It's Christmas"" is a soon-to-be classic and the video has a great chase scene at the end.Addendum: Almost three years have gone by since I wrote this review. Our daughter is now four, and she still likes this video. Our twin boys are three. One twin likes it a very great deal. For the other, it is the Mona Lisa & the Hamlet of videos. If he has a bad day or is feeling under the weather, this video never fails to perk him up. HE LOVES IT. At this point ""The Toy that Saved Christmas"" is very easily my kids' #1 favorite Veggie Tales video of all time, and for the one son, his favorite video ever. Our family owns perhaps 200 kids' videos. If we had to go to a deserted island with just one, this would be it."
__label__2,"Vita Mix: Really neat. Got it for my sister in law. She loves it. We will ""steal"" some of the recipes from her."
__label__1,"To Easy: This video is more for chair bound and frail persons. I find a Beginning Yoga class too hard for my age (73), but this is more for the truly disabled."
__label__2,"THIS CD IS THE BEST!!: THIS CD IS TOO GOOD FOR WORDS. ITS AWESOME SKA/PUNK, AND I THINK LTJ IS THE BEST BAND EVER. IT HAS AWESOME SONGS LIKE JOHNNY QUEST THINKS WE'RE SELLOUTS, HAPPYMAN, AND AUTOMATIC. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY A SKA CD, MAKE IT LESS THAN JAKE. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A LTJ CD, MAKE IT LOSING STREAK."
__label__1,"Atomic (?) Clock: I have been using this unit for about ten months now. The clock runs well but I have already replaced the battery once. It seems that, if the clock is fast, periodically the clock has to pace through the 12 hours to reset. The other comments about this clock not adapting to the time change are absolutely true according to my experience also. In the fall, I had relatively little problem because I set the unit to Central time instead of Eastern until the unit finally corrected for the time change about a month later. Spring time change left me an hour off since the unit has no Atlantic setting. I did get them to send me a return number but, since it would cost me to send it back, I decided that it would not be worth my returning the clock...Caveat emptor!"
__label__2,"Knows what women want: There are very few movies that turn a woman on so much. Most movies about sex show it as agressive, this is the exception: a story about a man who wants to make women climax. Gere sizzles in every sex scene. But aren't some of those scenes clipped inthe video?"
__label__2,"Historical account of great English king: As a history teacher,I am always looking for visual aides for my students. This film captures the leadership and honor of Henry V. It accurately demonstrates warfare during the 1300's Hundred Years War. From the costume of Henry with both French and English standards to the longbows to the muddy fields, the Battle of Agincourt is recreated beautifully. Branagh is one of the finest Shakespearian actors of our time and potrays the king with compassion and strength. This is one Hollywood film of a Shakespearian play that does not deviate from how the playwright meant for the story to be told. It is an excellent historical film."
__label__1,"not one of my favorites: I do healing, chiropractic and yoga and use healing music ,howeverthis CD does not suit me, sorry to say."
__label__1,"Wish I'd Read the Negative Reviews More Closely: While I love my Weber Grill, Weber should be ashamed of this product!1. Design requires you remove all grates and warming basket to use. Gee, guess they never thought I might cook chicken / roast AND want to do a hot dog too.2. Too much work to use - cleaning means disassembling - and you have to use an adjustable wrench - not part of my normal kitchen tool kit. Too many pieces, not well thought out."
__label__2,"Very Interesting Advice!: I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It contains a plethora of information concerning wealth and possessions directly from the pages of Scripture. Because I was reading it as part of an online MBA program, I really enjoyed the fact that I had my Bible right there beside me as I read. That was the only shortcoming of the book - there are a ton of scripture verses referenced, but in order to fully get the context, you need to look them up on your own. I would have preferred to have them printed in the book. The good part is I liked the breakdown and organization to show how ideas concerning wealth are presented in the Bible. It really will make you think about what you have and what it's purpose really is."
__label__1,"Very poor transaction.: I returned it and four others as it was not compatible for our New Zealand region, as we require Pal. It was our wish to have them changed over, but no one wants to know us. So, no more dealings with ecom and we will spread the word."
__label__1,eb% Vibrant Eyes: This product was a waste of money. One of my 80 year old clients asked me to order it for her so I did and purchased some for my self. It did not have any promising results.
__label__1,"Beware of this outdated version: I was required to purchase this out-of-print book for a class. I thought I had found the most recent version on ecom, but, unfortunately, ecom did not reveal that this edition was published in 1981. I paid for expedited shipping only to be extremely disappointed. I had to wait an additional week or so to get the most current version from another source. Much wasted time and expense. Incidentally, the most recent version has one of the most poorly compiled indexes I have ever encountered, and this makes finding information unnecessarily difficult."
__label__1,"Here Are The Tired Old Men! A wasted oppertunity!: Geez, New Order themselves admit in the newest issue of UNCUT that they were too lazy to put this box set together that's why other persons chose the tracks. Please Bobby Gillespie stick to what you know best, rehashing MC5. There are so many unreleased & rare tracks that these geezers could've put on this thing like a very early track with Stephen Morris on vocals which is excellent. Base in your face."
__label__2,"Very cute story with expressive illustrations. Heartwarming: This was a family favorite of several of my children and unfortunately now that our copy is shredded, it's also out of print. The Very Best Christmas Present is about a cranky old man who doesn't realize how attached he has become to a stray cat until it stops coming around. Keep this book in a convenient location, it will be read often."
__label__1,"Weird size: My husband likes this mitt, but I can't stand it. It fits my hand really strange and is really tight and goes high up on the arm. It's just cut really strange."
__label__2,excellent product: every thing was great and we love this. No problem at all. it was bigger then we thought though!
__label__2,"NO OTHER BRA COMPARES!: I have searched every place thinkable for a comfortable, nice fitting bra that gave just the right ""umph"" no matter the price. I finally found everything I could ever ask for with this bra. It has just the right padding to not give you a fake figure or let the ""girls"" hang ten but give a sexy push up and keep them comfortable at the same time. I also love the strap; not too wide and looks nice if it shows by chance. Unfortunately for me, Lily of France stopped producing my size in this particular bra making it IMPOSSIBLE for me to find in stores! I just happened to find it online and was SUPER quick to buy it!"
__label__1,"Not Very Useful: First: Read other reviews carefully. Some are from people associated with the author -- one from the author himself! That 4-star rating may be skewed ...Second: If you are not Christian, you'll find this book preachy. If you are Christian, you may still find this book preachy.Third: The book lacks practicality. It is hard to figure out the author's directions for getting back on track. I bought this and two other books to help recover from Chapter 7. This was the worst of the three."
__label__1,"Defective Startup Disk -- No Download Option: Having read several positive reviews, I was very excited about this phone. Unfortunately, the CD that came in the box was defective and did not have the installation software. This could be easily fixed by allowing customers to download the software from the company's website, but this is not possible for this model. (According to tech support, it's available for the earlier CIT200 model, but for some reason not this model.)I suppose that I'll return the product for a new one and keep my fingers crossed that it will work, but now I've lost time, will have to wait again, and am not too encouraged. I hope others have more luck than I did."
__label__1,"A waste of time and money: I was so disappointed in the move because of the title - this movie is morally defunk,, intellectually bland and full of sick drama based upon immaturity and a lack of an understanding of true life.I wish I had never bought it or wasted my time viewing!I don't recommendit-unless you enjoy 20 years olds acting like high school teengagers in their lust hunt which they call love hunt!Can you say looser?"
__label__1,"This isn't the best remake.: Nothing beats an original. This is one of the worst remakes i've seen. The actors are horrible. The only thing cool are the death and how detailed it gets in. But anyways, its a lame remake.Nothing does beat an original.""Just keep telling yourslef Its Only A Movie."". I kinda wish it wasnt"
__label__1,Cheap quality: This scope came with my Gamo silent stalker. I went through 3 scopes and all had the same problem. It starts falling apart only after 100 pellets. The front lens just starts to unscrew itself. I gave up and tried putting locktite on the front lens. Now it's solid but the picture is not clear anymore. Guessing it's now falling apart internally. Don't buy this scope for any powerful air gun.
__label__1,Tub Leaks!: We ordered this tub months ago when we were stocking up on stuff for the baby and when it came time to finally use it were disappointed to see that the plug actually leaks! Such a bad design and very disappointing. Otherwise I would have really liked this tub and really like the infant sling attachment.
__label__1,"Don't buy this from ecom.: I bought this as my second 2nd CHI flat iron because my first one worked great and lasted about 5 years. My first one was more expensive, it cost around $80. This one looked exact the same and cheaper so I bought it. It worked fine for a month and 10 days then suddenly died! I can't return or exchange after 30 days of purchase. If you buy it, buy from other source with warranty."
__label__2,Chicken Soup for the Soul Christmas Treasury: I purchased several of these books for Christmas gifts. I put them in baskets with a can of Campbell's chicken soup and a fleece comforter. I got rave reviews on the book. One recipient said she just couldn't put it down. The price of the book was fabulous!
__label__1,"not enough power for large laptop: Even though this power adapter says ""120W"", it cannot provide enough power for my Dell D800 laptop which requires a 90W power supply. This unit got hot and kept shutting off while I was in-flight. It may be sufficient for smaller laptops that do not require 90W, but for my purposes it was close to useless. I had to continuously unplug the device from the power port on the plane while my laptop was in my lap. This is a terribly awkward situation, especially when sitting in coach. I do not recommend this product if you need 90W supply. I bought this as a replacement for the CyberPower 150W DC-to-AC Adapter Model CPS150BI that I misplaced. I will buy another CPS150BI now."
__label__2,With winning in mind: Fantastic book for anyone in competition or just in life. I have applied the info to every aspect of my life professional and parenting. Would highly recommend
__label__1,"Disappointment: I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with, was a no go. Product would not install from enclosed CD; computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed USD cord. A loss of time and money. I have since ordered, received and installed from another product - Data Point from another vendor."
__label__1,"Low Budget - not like the books: Hi,i was very disappointed by this DVD Series!If you read the books forget the movies.The battles are looking very unrealistic and there areonly around 100 soldiers.The bridge in this movie is a cheap wood bridge, also there is nosecond battle when the bridge after the bridge has beendestroyed.Even the capture of the eagle is a scene of 2 minutes."
__label__2,"Small but does the job: I was happy with the looks and size of the kettle, but it seems to take longer that I thought to to boil. I am comparing it to one that I used in France, it would heat up in a flash. But, from what I heard the electric current is stronger over in Europe and that is why it heats up faster.It does the job and I am please with it and the price is very good for what you get. I would recommend it."
__label__2,"always looking for that next great series... Big Readers, picky taste!: Well, if you've finished, the lastest series and are looking for a new one. I think you'll be happy with this! We've finished, Harry, loved Artemis, reread Twilight, waited for bk two of Fablehaven, enjoyed Spiderwick, and took a futuristic trip with Ender. So this was a big surprise and a much loved journey, one I think you'll enjoy. Excited Teacher."
__label__1,"Simply did not work: Simply did not deliver as promised. I went to the conference, and I found the theology to be unbiblical, useless and with no results. As usual, author blamed everything on lack of my faith etc...Advise: Seek God personally, there are no quick fixes. Anyone who promises you that is offering snake oil. Wallen was right about one thing, Jesus is the final authority and a relationship with the Holy Spirit is of vital importance. The rest is just his views and takes on the origins of soul and demons; which I found to be flawed, contradicting and non biblical.Before I went to the conference I had a good review posted up here, but after having seen for myself, I cannot agree with it anymore."
__label__2,"An Amazing series for an Amazing Price!: Scream 2 was one of the first horror movies that I watched when I was younger. I remember it specifically scaring the shit out of me, yet I wanted to see the other movies in the series. So I eventually viewed them, and loved them just as much! Such a great series! I got the triple pack for about $13 if I remember correctly. Such a great deal for three great slasher movies! The plots always have you wondering who the masked ""Ghost Face"" is, or who it isn't, for that matter;) Great action, suspense, acting and plot! This is a bargain and golden gem. If you don't have this movie series in your horror collection,make sure to pick it up!!!"
__label__2,Innovative: Probably the italian answer to the experimentation which already started in england or Iceland....eheheh....probably the best cd I' ve ever listened to. I love them.
__label__1,"It's not the real thing: This is not the real product. The scent / smell lasts for an hour or less. No wonder it was so cheap. ecom should not be selling these types of products (fake, imitations, etc)"
__label__2,"Get a new editor!: Good grief! I watched the VH-1 presentation of this CD/DVD last night and I continue to be impressed. I've listened to their unplugged session too and they are very talented songwriters and musicians and shine when they perform live.Yeah, the sisters are hot but you can't look at them when your listening to and enjoying the songs on your Rio mp3 player.In an industry loaded with lip-synching frauds like Britany and Janet, the Corrs are a breath of fresh air."
__label__1,Great series bad DVDs: The original music set the series apart like no other series I have ever watched. I think the studio is trying to double dip and will release a Restored version next year with a BlueRay version.Until they come up with the originals stick to TIVO.
__label__1,bad experience: I have a complaint filed with ecom and this order is under review with my credit card company. Never received it. And no one at ecom has answered my complaint as of yet. The seller has never answered my e-mails either. this was a birthday present that i was not able to deliver. Very upset
__label__2,GET THESE!: Well I live up in Alaska so for about 6 months out of the year the roads are covered in ice and the ditches are full of vehicles and bottomless snow pits. Now I only use the chains when i have to which is very rarly but they make all the difference especially these! I own a 4x4 Ranger and with the V bar chains I can pull just about anyone out. I have pulled out more 1 tons from ditches with these then any other type of chain or other traction device. Once you get them on the v bars dig right into the ice and give you all the traction you could ever need. I plan on ordering another set once I have some extra money.
__label__2,"Fantastic Story: This story is about the adventure of Barney and his pals during whom they tried to put the strange egg back to where it landed. Barney and his pals used imagination, such as turning the wood log into aeroplane. This arouses the curiosity of every child, especially my 31 months old son. My son liked it very much. There were many lovely songs presented in the movie, like twinkle twinkle little stars, in which toddlers loved so much."
__label__1,"Not A Toy: It's actually a very poorly made and easily damaged costume. The purple color comes off in a strong breeze. Therefore it is very overpriced. Mine arrived with the fabric pre-ruined, but I don't have time or funds to make/buy another costume. You are much better off just buying a wig and putting the rest of the costume together yourself."
__label__1,"Nice book if you have a wonder husband, men should read it: Some of the ideas in this book were useful, but many ""helpful"" tips were based on two premises: 1) that you have extra money and 2) that you have an extremely supportive husband.For example, p. 211 says ""Richard could see that I was about to collapse, so he immediately called a nearby hotel, made a reservation, and sent me away..."" Checking into a hotel for a good night's rest (along with many other suggestions by Eyre) doesn't exactly fit into most one-income multiple-child families.And I couldn't help but chuckle when I read p. 249, ""Most husbands would be delighted to be asked to listen to or feed children for fifteen minutes before work while you clear out your cobwebs."" Oh really? Let's take a survey on that one!"
__label__2,Very. Nice!: I bought this for my son in law. He loves the large size and easy storage that it has. Great gift.
__label__1,plastic faucet fittings?: Cheap plastic faucet fittings. Less rigidity of the plastic fittings causes it to loosen and leak. Plastic will wear out faster and can't handle the pressure. Why would you do this?
__label__2,"Best men's shoes!: These are the best casual shoes my husband has ever had, they last for ages and are very comfortable. First got some in Vancouver several years ago and finally sourced another pair through ecom who were excellent in their response and delivery of the product...brilliant!"
__label__1,LG Lost Greateness: I have owned this for less than three weeks and its not working. I am not sure how Best Buy handles these things but I will update you later.
__label__1,boring: I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list. Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure. I finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Dont waste your time
__label__2,"What a deal!!: I Bought Case, Headset,& Extra charger, through ecom for what the case alone was at AT&T. All exactly as advertised and arrived FAST!"
__label__1,Large and not well-made: Was about 1 size too large. The rust color on the side runs into the black in one spot. They were expensive for such a cheaply made boot. They looked nicer in the picture than they do in reality. Buy a cheap work boot instead. I am keeping them just because they are too expensive to ship back. I will have to wear them with two pairs of socks. I should have ordered from Zappos with free retruns.
__label__2,"Napoleon rules the world again!: I disagree with 'Jamie Hardy', not only am I a fifteen(almost sixteen)year old junior in highschool, I find that I can relate to this more than anyone else. I first saw this movie with my senior friend, her sister, and our art club. We're the semi-nerds at our school and have had the best time watching this DVD over and over again. We bought it on the 30th, my little sister's birthday during a surprise party and made a few new fans out of it.I think that the cast said it best that everyone can relate with at least one of the people portrayed in the movie. For me, it's Napoleon, for my sister, it's Kip, and for my senior friend, it's Deb. This movie has someting for everyone and that's why everyone loves it!"
__label__1,"not great: This product is not salon worthy. I hate how it feels in my hair. It does not leave my hair feeling weel conditioned or tangle free which was why I ordered it. Save your money, do not get this!"
__label__1,"Good Message, Slow Movie: The message of the movie was good, but the movie itself was low budget,slow moving and boring. I'd recommend reading the book the movie was based on instead, ""In His Steps What Would Jesus Do?"" It was a really good book with the same true story and the same good message."
__label__2,"A breathtaking appreciation of the people and their partner horses who have labored throughout history to look after cattle: Originally produced for exhibition in IMAX theaters, Ride Around the World is an award-winning DVD documentary about the 1,200-year history of the cowboy. From the cowboy's origins in Spanish and Moroccan history, to their transition to the New World, and the rodeos and shows that help preserve and celebrate their cowboy way of life today, Ride Around the World is a breathtaking appreciation of the people and their partner horses who have labored throughout history to look after cattle. Bonus features include a trivia quiz and a making-of featurette. Also available in a Blu-ray version, Ride Around the World is the perfect gift for cowboy fans everywhere and an excellent addition to public library DVD collections. 40 min. plus 23 min. featurette."
__label__2,"Good Cheap Reliable LOUD: I've had this alarm clock for a number of years. (I believe at least 3)I never had to change the battery and it just keeps telling me:The time, date, temp, as well as waking me the hell up.I have serious, serious, problems with waking up...Aside from this alarm.. I use.. my phone, another radio alarm, my stereo.The loudness of this alarm makes me set the time on it as a last resort when all of the abovefail to get my zombie..butt... out of bed.It is so loud, I have to jump out of bed... at least to turn it off... in fear of waking up the neighbors in my apartment building.*****I never really adjusted the time on it, it seems to reset itself, it knows when the daylight savings times are..after about 3 years of use.. it's a little bit on the fast side by about 2 or 3 min.I kinda need the head start so I don't mind"
__label__1,"Got the wrong one.: The tubing cutter I ordered is not the one I received. Yes, I know what you are thinking, just return it. Well, I don't have the time or the patients for that. Watch out for this store, I would not buy from them again. The cutter I got is not a nice as the one in the picture. It does work, but it is not a professional tool like the one listed."
__label__2,great coffee: No complaints at all. Easy to use and makes authentic espresso. You will need some smaller (around 2 inch tall) cups.
__label__1,"Hugely inaccurate: It doesn't take long to find errors in this book: just read the wholly inaccurate plot synopsis of The Last Picture Show, which is hardly obscure or difficult to find on video, and thus would have been easy to check.Or how about the reference to a film receiving an R rating from the MPAA *several years prior to the establishment of the MPAA's rating system*?Had this been a book of insights or analysis, a few such lapses might have been forgivable. But this is a dry reference work, with little interpretation by the author: and dry reference works require a higher standard of accuracy."
__label__2,"A Must for Pumping Moms: These bottles are great and super easy to use and clean. My one grip is that they're somewhat costly, especially considering that I store 10oz of milk a day, which equates to 4 bottles (each bottle is 2.5oz). If I didn't also use the plastic Medela freezer bags, I'd have to purchase a box every three days."
__label__2,"The Game is Good: I been waiting for this one, especially after Long Time No See. I guess after not knowing what to expect from that cd, I was surprised how good it was and now I'm holding up even higher expectations for whatever Chico does. But judging this new one on its own, it's a strong follow-up, and still better than alot of stuff that passes as soul these days."
__label__1,"What a disappointment! Embarassingly bad.: It seems to me that D. Icke is trying to start a franchise. This book is downright bad. His research (unlike ""the truth shall set you free"") is minimal.He dedicates over two chapters to Babylon and Phoenicia, from which he then derives most of his later conclusions. However, both chapters are WRONG. In fact, ""purposely inaccurate"" is more like it. At times, he quite deliberately mixes and matches words and place names to confuse the reader and create false impressions to support unsupportable theories.I think that this book was simply written because the public expected one. I have personally lost all respect towards mr Icke."
__label__1,"Didn't grow: I don't care for this mushroom kit. When it was time to open the bag it came in, the mushrooms started to form in all different colors, not like a shiitake mushrrom is suppose to be. I had to throw it away due to concern about what kind of mushrooms they really are."
__label__2,"REVEALING BOOK: This book explained everything that comes from God himself, few of them are magical, meditative, practical. It reveals the secret of microcosm unto macrocosm by the use of numbers. As a whole this explained everything which is hidden."
__label__2,Needs to be bigger so I can use it: She loves it (6mos). She often falls asleep in it and has recently started playing with the bird and gecko animals that hang down from the leafs.
__label__1,This CD gave me a headache: Don't get the CD just for the song FLY. You will be disappointed. It's so much of a head banger I refused to place it in my CD carasel. I could not even listen to any of the other songs completely through.
__label__2,"stop wasting money on other lipsticks you don't use!: I'm a very fair-skinned woman of 60-something, and have always worn sheer or little-colored lipsticks -- much color makes me look hard -- so I ended up putting most of my buys in a drawer, to maybe use later -- and I have a drawer full of money I've wasted. A few years ago I found Youngblood glosses, and even though I pay a lot when you count the shipping, I actually save money because now I'M ACTUALLY USING WHAT I BUY! Love the 'Tantalize' color. Highly recommend."
__label__1,Item not as advertised: I ordered a hi-lift jack mounting system and while the shipment was extremely fast (less than 24 hours). I am extremely upset that this product came missing 90 percent of the parts that were supposed to be inside the package. The product was supposed to come with two mounting brackets and all hardware to mount the system. When i opened the box inside the packaging the only thing that was inside was ONE mounting bracket and the velcro strap. What am i supposed to do with one mounting bracket. And you sold this product for only 5 dollars less than the new ones. I guess thats what I get for trying to get a deal. This was my first purchase through here for my jeep and I was planning on buying many more things from here but if I am only going to get products that are incomplete you can bet I will not buy from warehouse. And as far as your quick delivery you can bet that my shipment will be equally as fast because I am going to UPS right now to send it back to you for my refund.

Colin, who's a prodigy but not a genius, wants to create a math theorem predicting outcomes of romantic relationships.Colin and his friend Hassan are both city folk, and they go on a road trip to a small town to brighten Colin's spirits. Colin and Hassan are quirky, and the quirk factor increases when they collide with the residents of Gutshot, Tennessee.There are a few math formulas and graphs in the book, but they're not daunting. I haven't been a math person since college, and I didn't mind the trig or calculus or whatever it is interspersed in this novel. This is a fun book and I look forward to reading more John Green."

__label__2,"Dog apprehensive at first give it time: My dog is a toy maltese about 4 lbs. She didn't know what to do with the stairs at first so I started putting small treats on each step. I also walked her up and down a few times so she got used to them. She still refused to use them after all that, so I just left the stairs up each night just in case. Finally one night I heard her slowly going down the steps and then back up. Now she runs up and down them without hesitation :) The stairs are very easily folded and stored when not in use, which is a nice feature!"
__label__1,"I returned the item to the store after 2 months: I purchased the ss-5000 at Kohls on sale for $40.00 in November 2006. Didn't use it until Christmas. I recently returned the item to the store after 2 months of use. The volume knob didn't work right and the time would jump back two hours from 9 PM until 4 AM.My volume knob had a good usable range for one month, then it started going only from loud to louder. It would go back to normal by jiggling it. I contacted Homedics only to find out that they had no plans of ever fixing these design flaws. I won't be purchasing it again. Too bad it didn't work, I can't find another alarm clock with outside temperature for $40. I guess there is a reason for that."
__label__2,KING BACK....YA DAMN RIGHT: This CD/DVD is off the hook man i just got it today it was only one copy of the Limted Edition left I'm glad I got it. T.I. really put it down on this one I have all his cd's and could not wait for this joint ever since i heard he was coming out with KING in January. From 1. King Back to 18. Bankhead I cant stop listening to it all the tracks are hot and T.I.'s flow is still sick his flow gets better with each new cd with ATL in theaters and this CD 2006 is this dudes year 4 real
__label__1,"NOT REALLY WHAT I WANTED OR NEEDED: I have been working with gourds for quite a few years now, something like over thirty. There was very little in this work I found to be useful. I am sorry to say I agree fully with another reviewer here who was less delighted with this particular work that probably I am. I did give it two stars simply for effort though. I strongly suggest you search further as there are quite a large number of books out there that are of better quality and certainly more worth the money spent."

My PS3 SlimPS3 320GB Uncharted 3 BundleandPlayStation 3 60GB Systemwouldn't read the disc at all yet they both will read other Blu-ray's, DVD's, and PS3 Games fine.

I will update this review once I test Taken. ecom.com customer service has really understanding of this issue."

__label__1,"Too good to be true: I was really excited to see the price on this card, however, once I tried putting in my phone, I was unable to format it because my phone did not recgnize the card. So, whenever I added files to it, they wouldn't be there the next time I turned on the phone or took the card out. I had to go to my service provider and get a card from them. Be careful, if something is too good to be true, then it probably isn't"
__label__1,"Waste: This album is a disgrace. The Stones are obviously trying to fill some contractual obligation (it was also a contractual obligation that led the Stones to record and release the rarity ""Co**sucker Blues"" which, ironically, is left off this album).By the way, Bill Wyman has been airbrushed out of the picture used for the album's cover. That's loyalty for you.Save the cash that you plan to spend on this album and give it to a Hurricane Katrina charity."
__label__1,"Did not receive the correct book from company: I ordered this book from cmuweb out of Minneapolis, MN. Too my surprise I didn't get it in the mail but a totally different book. The book I got was Lithuanian-English/English-Lithuanian Dictionary, with a totally different ISBN # and the picture on this site, it isn't even the same book. I wrote webbooks@umc.edu and I am hoping they will correct the error, so then I can really write a review the book I really ordered. I was really looking forward to start learning phrases, so I could practice on my Lithuanian friend. My shipping paper that came with the book said the correct book....but it sure wasn't the book when I was looking at it.....I was wondering what happened to the phrases????? Hope they correct this order. Thanks for reading."

Gone are the moments of beautiful vocals and anthems you can immerse yourself in...this is the kind of album I would listen to back in art school and pretend to enjoy. Do yourself a favor and pick up something like RED STARS THEORY new release, ""Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful."" It at least strives for sustained moments of blissful listening. RADIOHEAD won a grammy and now they need to prove to themselves that they're not mainstream, and we, as the audience, are forced to suffer through a full-length CD which will be quickly forgotten. If this were their first release, it would also be their last. Letting this trash grow on you simply means you've accepted the idea of lowering your standards.I'd give it zero stars if I could."

She does not research the people that is pointing her finger- otherwise she would realize that John Dewy was in fact AGAINST spilting the high school system into liberal arts and making the masses go into vocational traning. If she had read the School and Society she would see that her complaints about the school system are not the schools that John Dewy visiualized. She completely leaves out Woodrow Wilson ties to the process. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THE BOOK- it will piss you off when you resale it for 5.00!!!!"

DeNiro is his usual captivating self only this time instead of being an Italian gangster or wise guy in the 20th century, his character lives in 18th century South America.I enjoyed this film because I am a DeNiro fan and I enjoy his style of acting. It was pleasing to see him attempt a different type of role.If you're a DeNiro fan, check this one out"

The author also details the processing of the images of constructed features on the surface of the planet Mars. Mr. Carlotto was able to demonstrate in very easy terms the methods used to illuminate these breathtaking images. I eagerly await any book from this author on the latest set of images taken in 1998.

I had done nothing but buy over $135.00 worth airtime in May '07 and suddenly, my phone number was no longer active. After spending over 3 hours on the phone with TracFone, they claimed there was nothing they could do for me. I considered this a breach of contract and was out of cell phone service and money."

__label__2,"Reality: This movie portrays the ""real"" life situations of self-seeking self-autonomous relationships that spiral uncontrollably towards divorce when married couples seek to control the relationship or change their spouse. While some of the references to sex seemed to be added for shock effect, the reality is that without some sense of ""us"" guiding a relationship the reality is the meaningless and vanity that the husband and wife experience in most of this movie.Some cheesy scenes and: (1) Who sends their kids to camp all summer and (2) Who believes their kids are oblivious to their parents marital problems?In the end, though, the recognition of communal fellowship grounded in the other brings hope to the tyrannical, self-consuming, and chaotic relationship which is symptomatic of current American society."

In Long Way Home, the trombone is brought back into the foreground as a lead instrument, whether in smooth jazz or soft techno complemented by electronica (now known as the chill music genre). The soul-stirring tracks are ""Long Way Home"" (3:57), ""Fool's Full Quiver"" (4:29), ""See the Memo"" (5:05), ""Whole Lotta"" (5:21), ""Still in Love"" (4:46), ""Lemonade Alchemy"" (4:45), ""Leaving Paradise"" (4:18), ""Dualife"" (6:08), ""Charm Offensive"" (3:46), and ""Last Dance"" (3:01). A joyful music experience especially recommended for anyone interested in discovering the full soundscape capabilities of the trombone for themselves."

And I am not talking about her touching the earring, but simply doing a normal girls life. I had to intensely look for one earring at least twice, as it got lost, until I finally lost it for good! and I am talking about not having used the earrings more than two weeks. Too expensive to loose them and to have lost them so easily!!! I could not even get to prove whether they were actually hypo-allergenic or not since my girls would usually get allergic of gold earrings after weeks or months!"

I wasn't aware this was the latest of a series, but that didn't bother me.

I had recycled the original packaging literally 12 hours before (after holding on to it for a while to be sure that everything seemed to work) and thus cannot return the item. I feel ripped off. The business which actually shipped it said that I could try to send it back to Honeywell, but I know that I'll end up investing more time in the process than the item is actually worth. Honeywell screws Jersey City once again! (They polluted our community with chromium--think Erin Brokovich--and refuse to clean up or foot the bill for cleanup)"

It may make sense to those who have--and perhaps the author was on a trip when he wrote it.Suffice it to say that the protagonist's drug-induced revelations about his father, cameras, abduction victims, South America, refrigerators, lakes and all seemed unconnected. It was one of those rare mysteries that I abandoned at the 230-page point, unable to find a reason to continue."

__label__1,"For those with 9 cup food processors...: The juice extractor does FIT the 9 cup fp, as Kitchenaid says, however, it doesn't actually WORK with it. The attachment sits in the bowl just as it should, it spins around, but the food pusher does not reach down far enough to actually make juice out of your veggies. Whatever you drop in will simply go straight through without scraping the bottom, as Kitchenaid says it should, and then spin around like mad without making juice. I spoke with Kitchenaid a couple of times and I am sending it back. I even tried putting in larger chunks but it just won't hold them in place because the pusher and tube extender are not long enough. I also tried a wooden spoon for a pusher but it didn't help due to the shortness of the tube. Bottom line, no matter how bad you want this extractor, like I did, don't get it for a 9 cup processor."

But even for Sassy, this toy is a steal. Even better, unlike his other activity center which cost four times as much, my baby actually enjoys all four of the activities on the toy. There's a cylinder with colorfall balls that roll around, a squeaky smiley face, a bell and clapper that ding, and best of all, a gearshift which makes a very satisfying ""scrunch scrunch"" sound. Even though my son is still fairly uncoordinated, he can make most of the activities work just by swiping at them (he still needs some help with the squeaky smiley face). One note of caution -- this is definitely not a highchair toy. This toy packs a whollop when it's dropped (I know, the hardwood floor in my kitchen now has a big choink gouged in it). As long as you confine this toy to the floor, you and your baby are in for a lot of fun."

This cd, in particular, sounds likeit can work as lounge music or something to pop in the player after a night of hanging out.""My Heart"" is their best cut here, especially two-thirdsinto the track when it's just total chaos of overlappinglyrics and sonic assaults. This was arguably their peak. However, this stuff sounds just as cool and fitting today asit did back in 1990. Enjoy the Show!!!"
__label__1,"'Comic', apparently.: There are some people who try to reclaim 'Nadja' - along with Abel Ferrera's 'The Addiction', the most stultifyingly pretentious film ever made, bludgeoning the audience with Wim Wenders-like globs of pseudo-philosophical gabble and supposedly 'arty' screes of visual incoherence - by suggesting it is comic. Making humour of what, exactly? Of horror films? You have to know what horror films do before you can mock them, and director Almedeyra hasn't a clue. American indie films? Probably, but it replicates that mind-numbing mindset so faithfully, it forgets to be funny about it. Students, whose existential angst and elevated notions of 'beauty' find expression in My Bloody Valentine records? Definitely.

As the other reviewer pointed out, this DVD is rather empty of contents.

Even after being chewed on, they show no signs of bite marks or any other wear. I have not experienced any problems with mold or other growth inside the toy. I squeeze the water out after each use, then store in a bath toy holder with the animal's 'mouth' facing down so any excess water will drip out. I honestly dont do this every time, and it's still been fine.Great teaching tool. Used them to teach about what each animal is called, what it says. Jokingly ask 'do we eat this animal' to teach about foods. Can be quite educational. Not to mention teaching about water displacement (air replaced with water for squirting).Durable, fun, inexpensive - can't go wrong with these."

Eight years after I read them the first time I found myself wanting to re-read them (not something I do often) Not to post a spoiler but the gist is a young girl who dreams of changing her situation, and the crazy tale of how she winds up doing so. If you are not sure you want to spend money on it, get book 1 from a library and you'll know from that if you want to own it, or read the others. You can also save some money and buy the trilogy all togetherThe Free Bards (Bardic Voices)But there is another book that is not necessary, but goes in between the second and third bookA Cast of Corbies (Bardic Choices)"

It's right up there with The Giving Tree in terms of giving kids a warped view of what real life and realtionships should be about. Nevermind that even the angles of the illustrations promote a feeling of sneakiness, nevermind that the mother's face is half hidden behind the bed as she's crouched stalking her sleeping child. Nevermind the fact that this woman is driving across town at midnight to break into her adult son's house and ordering him to come see him because she's old and sick... Not once, the entire time he's growing up, does she express this (obsessive) love she has for him during the day when he can be a part of it. That, I think, says it all. This is a book of pure nostalgia and it is meant for adults. By reading it to children you put the burden of love and codependence on them. That's not fair."
__label__2,"A Brilliant, Savage Interpretation Of Stravinsky's Rite: Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra yield a magnificient performance of Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" that emphasizes the raw, barbaric quality of the score. This is by far the most dynamic recording I've heard of this work, pulsating with much raw, emotional energy. Gergiev leads his forces in a series of sonic explosions from the woodwinds, brass and percussion. As for the Scriabin, it is an interesting choice highlighting the young Stravinsky's musical ties to the older Russian composer; this performance seems far more restrained, and slightly less compelling than a Carnegie Hall performance of this work that I heard earlier this year with Gergiev conducting the Kirov Orchestra. Still, this CD is worth acquiring just for Gergiev's dynamic interpretation of Stravinsky."

But my fave on the album is ""Close my eyes""... such a beautiful song... & i saw Jordan at 2 live shows last weekend, he sang live all the way & gave us extra dance routine during ""give it to u"", omigod what a great performer!"

__label__2,"Recommended by Critic: This book sparked my interest in computer overclocking. Before I read this book, I thought the idea behind overclocking a computer was adolescent wannabes who wanted to burn up Mom and Dad's PC - not true. I learned that there are very practical applications for overclocking a computer, namely cost and efficiency, ie., speed.The authors cover almost all the CPUs from Intel and AMD. There are no Pentium I's or the very latest barn burners in here (book was published in '03), but the point is that a *lot* of relevant info is between the covers for anyone who wants to find it. Yes, the book is dated, but the background info such as how the CPU industry works and what ""speedbinning"" is will make the reader giddy with new insight.My final advice is give this book a try if you're new to the overclocking scene, and even if you're not, as there is a wealth of awesome reference info here. Light it up and let it howl!"

__label__2,"Great job!: I love this book! Blank books are so scary to me, too much white space to deal with. But Gwen's direction really helped calm my fears. My favorite part is how she shows many ways to prep the page before working on it. I have finished my first book, now I'm ready to start my second. If you've always wanted to take part in the art of journals, this book is a great help in doing so. There are a lot of photos of different works, many of which you say ""I can do that!"". That's what got me started."
__label__2,"Quick grammar review: This is a very handy reference for those who are trying to learn biblical Greek but need an instant refresher of the parts of speech in English and don't have much time to get up to speed. Very helpful. If you need to learn how to diagram sentences, you'll need an additional resource for that. This one includes only the most cursory review of that topic. I still recommmend it for students of biblical Greek."
__label__1,"Disappointing: If you want to sit down and listen for 8 straight hours, then this is for you - if you want to listen to any of the 7 stories individually, then you'd be much better off buying the book and reading into your own recording machine. This tape series is very poorly done. 6 two-sided tapes are included in the package with absolutely no additional information. The first story does indeed start at the beginning of side #1, but after that, you're on your own; maybe it ends at the end of side #2 or maybe somewhere in the middle of side #7. Who knows. I've given up trying to cue up any of the other stories, as there's no way of knowing how long any of them or where any of them start or end.If, after reading this, you still want to buy it, email me and I'll put mine up for sale at ecom. It's useless to me."
__label__2,"Super Product: Once again when I can't find a product, it is at ecom! This mirror is perfect for makeup, with four light selection, just like the one I used for over 20 years. I have put it on my home office desk for daily use, the closed panels and front plug are pluses."
__label__1,"Not for fine ground coffee!: Like any other permanent filter on the market, this requires weekly cleaning with vinegar, or other cleaner to keep build up on filter from adding bitterness to coffee. Permanent filters are also not recommended for finely ground coffee, at least not without the addition of a paper filter, preferably unbleached."
__label__2,"Great Listening!: A great mix of artists and styles - I love it! It's my perfect ""office CD"". My favorite is, of course, ""Compared to What"" - that song is absolutely timeless. I recommend this highly."
__label__1,"The Stand DVD - TV mini-series: After reading the most recent version of the Stephen King novel, ""The Stand"", I ordered the DVD version of the TV mini-series, aired in the early 1990s. One of the worst translations of a book to film I have ever seen. The acting was juvenile, except for a couple of instances, the characters poorly developed and even misinterpreted from the book. I thought I was watching a high school play. The worst played character of all was 'Harold'. Not sure where they found this guy, but he butchered the character totally. Do not buy or watch this DVD and, in fact, all copies of this mini-series should be collected and burned. To add to the agaony, the DVD disk was defective with much pixelation throughout the various episodes."

__label__2,Dunham is great: Love this man's routines. Can watch over and over and it's still funny. Never know what to expect from him next.
__label__1,Terrible sound: The sound on this dvd is just gruesome. Performance is way below expected. This is one in a long line of music dvd's and bd's which has terrible sound. Why bother to release such items? Does not the producer or the performer LISTEN to the sound before release? I think not. What a waste of money. I am sick of beiing robbed with bad releases like this. Also- the other reviewers here- how can they give top ****** for this? Reviews like that are misleading consumers.
__label__2,"Best Grunfeld Book on the market: I am a LIFE-Master. I teach chess for a living. I have been playing tournamment chess since the late 60's. And the Grunfeld used to be my primary defense against the Queen's Pawn Opening. This is simply maybe the best book on the Grunfeld that is available today. Every line is covered. The analysis if of the highest quality. The writing is clear and concise and very easy to understand. You cannot go wrong getting this book. (Many good, complete and well-annotated games inside.)"

Sorry!"
__label__1,"Pathetic: Bought this on sale, and glad I didn't pay full price. I used a few times and the metal cable burned nearly through (so now it's hanging by a few threads). After a few uses it stopped beeping, so now I need to run over every few minutes to check if food has reached proper temp. Also, it's not that easy to set the temp buttons. I'll stick with my digital instant-read one."

__label__2,"OTHER THRILLERS PALE IN COMPARISON!: You won't be able to put this one down; get ready for a VERY late night! ""Soon She Will Be Gone"", will have you breathless in anticipation of what will happen next! Just when I thought I had ""figured it all out"" I was surprised by another twist, another turn, all the way up to the unpredictable ending.You won't regret buying this book, it's one heck of a roller coaster ride!"
__label__1,"Just okay: This is the cutest camera, but that is about it. The pictures are not very clear--lots of pixels. You can't take pictures in moderate light. You must not twitch or the picture will blur. The focus is off. The lens isn't dead center, so you have to adjust your position for a centered picture. The print out is low quality. But again, it is cute and very James Bond looking. It also works like a jump drive and you can transport files (word docs, pictures, etc.). I would have preferred to pay about half of what I did, but it will make a fun gadget on Christmas day and to keep in the car as the just-in-case-camera."
__label__2,"Nice Hat, Just Don't Sweat: This is a very nice ball cap. Looks great and fits well. The only problem is that if you sweat while wearing it the red liner bleeds onto the white cap, leaving you with a lovely pink hat. Wear it and enjoy it when it's cool - just don't sweat."
__label__2,Works: I'm still not exactly sure how it works but it does. I used it with the Arm and Hammer 'Clean Burst' laundry soap. It removed tarnish from all the cracks and crevices that would have been very hard to manually polish...
__label__1,"Unevenly grinds beans: This grinder does not work well if you use a French press to make coffee. It grinds the beans very unevenly - some large pieces and some very fine dust, even on the ""Percolator"" (coarsest) setting.

Where I live, we have frequent power outages (especially in the Summer months with electricity demand). If I am using my Home Theater projector and the power goes out without the proper cooling of the bulb, I could lose 25% of the bulbs life. Bulbs for projectors run around $200 - $300 dollars. With the simple investment of this APC BE550R UPS unit, this problem is eliminated. I am probably going to get one more for my upstairs Home Theater system to stop the ""surges"" to my equipment when the power tries to come back on, also."

The Capulets are all but wiped out and Juliet's true identity has been hidden from her for her own safety. Originally this series was sold as 2 different sets, the first being Juliet and the second being Romeo. This S.A.V.E. edition inculdes both sets in 1 pack."

Well after 30 minutes of reading, I was too bored to continue on. Not to say I hate to read... but come on, it's 2004.... the characters should talk!It reminds me of the disappointment I have for ""Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga"" for GBA. Too much reading... a side kick... a RPG.Sorry to say, I gave up on this game! I only gave the game 2 stars because it has great graphics & has Mario. Keep in mind (which I didn't)... if you hate RPGs, steer clear from this game! If you like to read stories and play RPGs, buy this game!"

__label__1,"Dull, dull, dull: This was very dull reading. I had to force myself to finish it. The love story is not at all compelling and the two lovers never had an interesting conversation. With all the opportunities for suspense in this book, there is none. In France, Charlotte disobeys orders to return to England and spends the money alloted her by the SOE on new clothes and panties for herself, instead of helping people in the Resistance. It makes the SOE look incompetent when they praise her for doing a good job. The token ""snitch"" in the French village is a cliché character. The Jewish story did not work, and Charlotte's hanging out in front of the concentration camp was ludicrous. I suspect this was a ""bottom-of-the-drawer"" manuscript that the author submitted after the success of ""Birdsong."" I hope the movie will be better than the book."
__label__1,"What a Struggle: This book was a real struggle to read. The authors thank their editor for helping to combine the writing of a Canadian and an Englishman, but as an American, I kept tripping over the excessive use of commas. Coupled with numerous typos, it was very hard to complete this book. While the authors disagree with Baigent and Leigh, I will credit the latter with providing footnotes, a more complete bibliography, and an index, all of which are missing from this book. This leaves me without much to pursue further. The real disappointment is the realization that this book is really only a part 1 of a story and all of the promises made to reveal things are left to the next book. I gave it the second star only because there actually are some original ideas presented here. Too bad the only way to continue to research their ideas is to take them on faith or wait for their next book. I hope they change editors before then and give us the benefit of some real references."
__label__1,"Cliche and Unimaginative: I picked this one up from the library after having seen that ecom recommended it as one of the best new thrillers. I was so disappointed. The characters are all one-dimensional and flat. And their names are bizarre... Smoky Barrett? Callie Thorne? (the name of an actress from the TV show Homicide, btw) The way they talk and the way the narrative reads is all extremely irritating and juvenile. And yes, the author throws in dime-store explanations for any typical detective work, i.e., the computer crimes detective having to explain the world of online porn, how IP tracking works, etc. It was distracting and condescending. The author couldn't decide if he was writing CSI for dummies, a pop psychology book for women who've experienced trauma, or a tongue-in-cheek satirical tribute to serial killer books. All three did not work. I'm sorry I wasted my time and sorrier still that ecom recommended this title."

While the plot was okay, I found Rome's complete self-absorbtion to be a real turn-off.

I was really disappointed in this book and glad that I checked it out from the Library rather than buying it."

Call the Kenton County Public Library in Covington, Kentucky and reserve the Lambert series. You'll be glad you did. And one more thing, that reviewer also said this series was never on a best selling list anywhere that reviewer was wrong again...The Lambert Series by Victoria Taylor Murray has been on tons of them!

Do not believe it when they tell you you can substitute AA batteries if your recharables are out of power. They will only last for 4 shots before the camera stops working.I found a housing for my Olympus from the manufacturer that lets me use my full digital camera functions for less than the cost of this camera.

I use that term only because it is in the physical shape of a book i.e., words arranged on paper bound together with glue.How this 'book' ever got published is beyond me. Maybe Henrick has one of those nasty high-tech guns pointed at the head of the publisher. Why is it so horrible? Let me count the ways: 1. It's poorly written. 2. You don't believe the characters. 3. The situations are ridiculous.If I was one of the people who contributed to this travesty of a 'book' I would ask to have my name removed from the credits.The only reason I kept reading it was for the perverse pleasure of exclaiming, ""Oh my God!

I looked to buy another, but they no longer made the style I liked and the new style that company makes now is different. I tried the isocool gusseted side sleeper and it is a quality product, but not perfect. This pillow took a little getting used to. It is firm, but the ""notch"" is really comfortable in the neck and shoulder area. I have a neck injury and this pillow really helps me to be comfortable while sleeping."

Eevn Weird Food was better than this, and they have never done better than Fun & Games.

__label__1,"The Bible Tells You So: I bought this book because I have a 15 year old son. After I began reading it I realized that Dobson had a specific religious agenda. This book is a training manual for fundamentalist right wing Christians on how to apply literalist Bible teachings to bringing up young boys. It ignores years of scientific findings and common sense. If you are a fundamentalist Christian you'll find this book reinforcing to your already accepted beliefs, otherwise this is a deceptive and misinformed book."
__label__2,"Useful for ideas: Maybe not the best possible book in the world, but the only one like it I've found."
__label__2,"Accessible, Informative,Timely and Worth Reading: I enjoyed reading this book because it is both accessible and sophisticated. In a discourse too often characterized by polemics and sound-bites, Minow offers a thoughtful view of the trend toward privatization. Reading her book helped me see how complex these issues are, and gave me new insight into arguments I might otherwise have dismissed. I found it a rare treat."
__label__2,"Bedlam a wonderful read: I too hope that those who read the reviews that only gave this book one and two stars will give this wonderful book a chance. For those of us who truly enjoy a very well written book that one has to take the time to read and enjoy,not just rush through for the sake of reading a book, this was one of those books. I found myself reading slowly to enjoy the book longer and loving the way it was written.The story about maddness and being a lunatic in that time period was eye-opening and at times sad and overwhelming to think about. You will feel for the situation of all the parties in the book and the struggles they had to endure.This is a book with lots of history and details written into it so you could feel the fustrations and maddness at times in the situations, maybe Greg Hollingshead had that in mind and those that felt it the most didn't like the effort needed to read the book."

__label__2,Good book: I have not had a chance to read all of the book yet but it seems quite interesting. I love the runes and any knowlage I can gain is a plus.
__label__1,"Boring Movie: What a disappointment this movie was. It had really good actors but it was slow, uninteresting, and just a waste of time."
__label__2,Wonderful Book: I bought this book for my Pastor for Christmas and he loves it!! Buy Leonard Ravenhill books and you can't go wrong!!
__label__2,"Highly entertaining: I loved this movie. It is loaded with stars all of which are surprisingly funny in their roles. In particular, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda shine in a hilarious episode which really emphasizes their true to life friendship. For sheer entertainment you can't miss with this one."
__label__1,Too many characters left hanging: The book spends too much time on the judges and lawyer shuffling money around. Grisham also could have developed the characters a lot better. We learn nothing of anyones background except for what the judges are in jail for. There are a lot of characters in this book and no ones story is ever finished. Who wins the election? What happens to the CIA chief? What happens to all who were blackmailed? I don't know. This certainly wasn't a page turner for me. I think the premise was good but the development needs a lot of work.
__label__1,"Difficult Usage....I gave up: I purchased these about a year ago. Yes they are RF but the signal, when I finally did get both in sync, didn't communicate sound. I was able to get sound and pic on my television but with strong interference. I do not recommend. I never did find another product comparable to wireless pc to tv converters."
__label__1,"Poor Production -- Fair Performance: The lighting, editing, and camera work for this video is poor. Regardless, I watch live performances for the music. The sound recording was good, but I have mixed opinions about the performance. Mic was GREAT. Lindsey and Stevie were also great, but Christie was unemotional -- kinda like a non-chalet reporter. John was okay, but let's face it -- he's not much of a bass player."
__label__1,"Hogan's halo hailed on by this half-witted horror...: The first two films were wonderful fun, and worth repeat viewing. I only managed to sit in the theater until the end of this one by mustering great fortitude. Compared to the first two episodes, ""Los Angeles"" is lamentably lame. Skip it."
__label__1,"Bad Pictures, Confusing Directions, No Good Maps: I thought this book was terrible. There are only black & white pictures and few of them. The directions provided are very confusing and are not accompanied by any sort of map. It is full of information and places to go but VERY poorly organized."
__label__1,"Poor characterization leads us to imagine better deaths.: Something the authors hadn't banked on was the lack of sincerity shown by readers in their ongoing relationships with the characters of this series. The more of these books written, the more effacious plot details are sprinkled in the text, never mind the continually annoying margins and triple spacing. It seems incongruous that such a wide audience has been following this series, though of course it is better that they read this pabulum than other drivel a la Celestine Prophecy. Though this is better, by degrees only, it still conveys a gnostic worldview and a rare evidence of intertextual self-referentiality."
__label__2,Addicted to Unhappiness makes me happy!: I have read this book which is the first self-help book that makes sense to me. People do not intend to be unhappy (I know I don't) and yet I always wondered why I did stuff I did not want to do and had trouble doing stuff I wanted to do. This book is practical and really helful. Get it!

__label__1,"Looks good, toasts terrible: This is a great looking toaster, but the main thing that a toaster should do, toast, it doesn't. I started out at a four setting and after a number of weeks of trying various settings, I am now down to a one. It is still burning my bread!"
__label__2,Great value!: The book was an excellent value for the price. It is practically brand new so much better than I expected. It even came with the CD as promised!
__label__1,"Appalling: This is a personal opinion, but appalled is the only word I can use to describe this. And it's not really that musically interesting to me. The singing is excellent, but the story and the music.. that's another thing. Again, I know many people like it, but this is just not my cup of tea."
__label__1,"Broken: The clock on this product does not work. The light does not shut itself off. These are both things the description said it should do. The only thing it does is stay semi-fogless. This is a rip off, do not buy."

__label__2,"A MUST READ!!: God bless you, Michael Evans, for writing this timely and very informative book! I am absolutely sure that God has worked through you to inform people that the end times are here and that this nation had best ""get it's act together"" and pay attention to biblical prophecy. I was one of those who are ignorant about the roots of terrorism and found myself shaking my head in disbelief many times. So, folks, set aside that novel for now, and absorb some of Michael Evans knowledge!"
__label__2,"Excellent!: I previewed this from the library to make sure I liked it...most on the ball workouts tend to be the same. This one is good! She shows a lot of ""new"" (for me!)moves and slows down so you can feel the movements. She cues you to watch for straining your neck or putting pressure on the wrong areas so you put more focus on your core. I like that she uses movements I haven't seen on the other dvds and they're not your typical ab crunch movements which is great. I hate those! So far I love this one."
__label__2,"Wonderful: I may have a tin ear and no musical training but, I know what sounds and looks wonderful...this does!!!Review by my husband who received this from me as a birthday gift."
__label__1,"My mom loves it, I dont think its worth the money: This is my moms favorite lotion, so I bought it to try it out. It just seems like regular over priced lotion to me. Ill stick with Bath and body works"
__label__1,"Not Sure What the Hype Is: I really wanted to like this novel. Was looking to sink my teeth into it. The book got off to a good start but soon I began to feel cheated. The ending was dismal. As a detective novel this book fails miserably. Trying to unravel the clues is useless. As a literary work, this also piece also fails. Although some characters are well developed, others are one dimensionally vilified and demonized."
__label__2,X-Wing fighter: Everything I expected when I ordered it. It was difficult to find (not in stores) but ordering it was easy and shipment came rather fast. In very good condition and to my surprise it came with a Luke Skywalker pilot when it had said on website that one was not included. Overall very pleased and it is hanging in my son's room along with the Tie Fighter we had purchased previously.
__label__2,"Great: I ordered this a few months ago to receive it in time for football season.The ecom price was by far the best, the delivery was prompt, and the performance is outstanding.I receive local channels over the air and am on DirecTV. The settings for over the air are excellent with that method and when I switch to DirecTV they are set for optimized viewing with that input.Something really nice but not particuliarily mentioned anywhere is the audio output where I connect my wireless headphones stays active when the TV sound is muted. My Hiatache big screen does not do this.Also, as mentioned in another review, only the inputs which have a connection show up when you change inputs.I spent nearly a year researching and viewing HDTV's before I purchased this one and am completely satisfied."
__label__1,"Boring and Silly: Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a boring, silly film. It's hard to believe that Alfred Hitchcock had anything to do with this. I wasted over an hour watching it and it's just not worth spending any more time reviewing it. Not a good film."
__label__1,"A Fake SEAL: The dust jacket says Hutchins is a former SEAL, but this is not true. The book contains many detailed descriptions of operations for which the sources are unexplained--Hutchins, who had never been a SEAL, had not participated in them, does not mention any names of participants, does not say he has interviewed participants, and does not cite documents or written sources."
__label__1,"Poor home work solutions: Most texts include either the even or odd solutions to the homework problems. But not this one, it is just random. The problem is that there are not enough solutions so that if you are having problems in one area, doing more problems doesn't help you since you can't check your work. This author was either just lazy or could affort to meet the standard of other texts.Can't wait for Cramster to post their solutions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__2,"fun with personals: As recommended I read this book in snippets, as opposed to all at once. What fun! This book reminds us that not much has changed really when it comes to searching for love, and lifetime mates.The author did a great job of selecting a diverse selection of personal ads. Some were humorous, some bittersweet, and some, purely romantic.This book would make a great gift, could be used as a conversation starter, or a great topic for a book club."
__label__1,"Disappointed: I had high hopes for an interesting and different film, but I was disappointed. It is different, but unfortunately boring. There are some aspects to the artwork that are unique (shadows have fun treatments) but thats about it. Otherwise, the artwork is a let down. The eyes on the main character (Lain) were a window to nothing and she really wasn't endearing. It was very slow and not a ""ghost story"". Maybe the next few layers get more excitng, but I'm sure the anime doesn't get better."
__label__1,"Paint Your Wagon - DVD: Well, the DVD didn't work AT ALL in my player. I'm told that there's a difference in American DVD players and English DVD players. Had I known this before I wouldn't have ordered it. Anyway, I really can't give a review. I'll keep looking for a DVD that comes from someplace in the States. It didn't cost that much so I'm not going to bother to send it back."
__label__2,"No silver bullet but they do help: I bought these drops after several weeks of moderate nausea and a few bouts of vomiting. They are a little on the pricy side when you look at the cost per drop, but I've found them to be worth it. They aren't a magical cure-all by any means, but so far they are the only thing that I can count on to take the edge off my nausea, even if it's only for a little while.My biggest issue with this product is that I wish it were a little more discreet. Obviously morning sickness happens during the first trimester for most women and not everyone is comfortable with broadcasting their pregnancy at that point, so having a label that features a heavily pregnant woman and the word ""Preggie"" in huge letters seems a little tasteless. I ended up putting the drops into a ziplock bag and throwing out the container, but even the individual candy wrappers have ""Preggie Pop"" written all over them!"
__label__2,Classic: This was a replacement for one my teenage son lost as a child...he still loves it. I think its one of the best Beanie Babies there are.
__label__2,"Infamy is tight: This album is straight bangin'. I never thought Mobb Deep could make a good follow-up to Murda Muzik but I was proved wrong. This album may even exceed the level they set themselves for Murda Muzik. The single The Learning (Burn) is just crazy. I can't get enough of it. But the rest of the album is full of good songs too. If you've heard the first single, and you probably have, then this album won't disappoint. I wouldnt sh-t you dunn!!"
__label__1,"Poorly written: Backhouse tries to give a brief, accessible summary of the history of economics, but the book is so dry that it is almost unreadable. Although Backhouse brings in some social and political background, for the most part he's just listing people and theories. His explanations, designed for non-technical readers, are not mathematically complex, and do avoid unneccesary terminology. But they're written in a choppy, condensed style, without illumination from real-world examples. The result is just not compelling reading. And his decision to take his history back to Greek times doesn't really work: the pre-modern thinkers omitted from most standard histories aren't consciously writing about economics. Rather, Backhouse is inferring economic assumptions from literary or ethical discussions. This discussion is potentially interesting (although it suffers from the same flaws as the rest of the book), but not really the same subject-matter as the conventional history of economics."

__label__1,"So bad it should be banned: This is absolutely, positively, most truly the worst piece of writing you could possibly stumble upon. I was taken in by the hype of the movie and went out and bought the book. Read about 400 pages and couldn't take it anymore. I burned it. I am not kidding I burned it. This book is so poorly written that it hurts to read it. Do not buy it, read it, pay any attention to any person who says that this book is worthwhile. If you ever meet any one who liked this book cross the street and try to get away. I am feeling dirty just thinking that I actually paid for this piece of garbage."

Also the whole bit about not using camera tricks and then using them for the levelatation bit I felt let himself down greatly.

__label__2,"An incredible man, an incredible book...: An endearing look at one of our century's mathematical geniuses. Erdos lived and breathed mathematics. He had no home, no car, no family, and no interests other than numbers. He maintained an astonishing level of productivity right up until his death. Erdos existed on the generosity of others. He moved from university to university, giving talks, participating in seminars, but mostly just meeting other mathematicians and students, and asking ""what are you working on now?"" Colleagues welcomed him with open arms, for he was usually good for solving an intractable problem or two, collaborating on a few papers, and then moving on to his next temporary abode. This is a delightful book about a delightful person, eccentric though he was. It's also a good look into how mathematicians work."

The knife is quite flexible and cuts nicely. I wonder whether I shouldn't have gotten the Granton edge.There is really nothing to complain about with this knife, it just doesn't make you feel happy like when you grab a Wusthof or other high quality knife. But you also paid no where near what one of those puppies cost, so sometimes that can bring a wry smile!"
__label__2,"Great coming of age novel: Loved the written-as-a-letter style, loved the pop culture references and literary classics referenced, loved the characters. Afraid to watch the movie for fear of ruining the story!"
__label__2,"As they say on Robot Chicken ""What a Tweest ! "": We rented this film. We love scifi and thought this was a great movie. It has an unusual twist to it and if you can sit back, relax and not analyze it too much you will enjoy it. It's a little slow in the beginning and the main character is a bit annoying but, it was still a good movie.The special effects were pretty good - 4 out of 5The plot was great - 4 out of 5The Ending was great - 4 out of 5The Acting/Cast was good - 3 out of 5Worth the rental."
__label__2,Sacred Games (P.S): I would say this was a good book to read. It gives insight into the lives of the ordinary people of India and It encompasses the religion of India in an interesting way. At no time did I think I was wasting my time reading it and that is something because there is a lot of reading involved. At the end I was very glad I read it and there were certain aspects that stayed with me.
__label__2,"Tielhard De Chardin: This book has been one of the greatest inspirations and influences of my life. Tielhard bridges the gap between religion and science in a profound and wonderful explanation of how the earth, all of us, and everything that exists are part of a divine milieu, ever expanding and moving towards its next evoloution. Fantastic."
__label__2,"Great series that can really get kids interested in nature: I have always been a fan of nature documentaries but this is definitely the most beautifully captured, composed and presented series I can remember. After Tivoing the series I was annoyed with the distractions that were always onscreen, I decided to buy this to enjoy to its fullest. I highly recommend this to everybody. If you have Blue Ray, definitely take advantage of it."
__label__1,"Are you kidding me?: I should have figured with it being so cheap but really I ordered graffitti ping pong balls NOT cat toys that are neon spot colored. Literally it says on the package ""Cat Toy"" on it. Go to the 99 cent store and pick this item up if you really do want it, save yourself a wait time of 15 days for delivery plus they probably have colors that are a little more ""graffitti"" and a little less day glow. I'd be weary of anything else this company sold."

I will never listen to the album in its entirety again. I tried and tried, but like my vacuum, this album sucks. Sad because I love Hooverphonic's Power of Milk and all their earlier stuff. I am sadly disappointed with all these hopeful and promising reveiws that led me to buy this unreturnable reminder of this enormous waste of my money and hour of life I will never get back.

__label__1,"About As Good As A Movie Called ""Ghoulies IV"" Could Be: Let me begin by stating that Ghoulies IV is a bad movie. Still, it has some goofy and hilarious moments sprinkled throughout that make it okay viewing for the b-movie fan. What disappointed me was that the original Ghoulies were nowhere to be found in Ghoulies IV, other than in flashbacks. Here we have new Ghoulies, and they are actually good guys. And they talk. Also, I wouldn't consider Ghoulies IV a horror movie or even a horror-comedy like the others in the series. It's a cop action-comedy with some supernatural elements. I swear, it's as if director Jim Wynorski hadn't seen any of the other entries in the Ghoulies series, because this one isn't like any of the others at all. And speaking of Wynorski, there isn't any nudity in Ghoulies IV. That must have been a first for him. After seeing Ghoulies IV, I can understand why this was the last in the series. The others were so bad they were good. This one's so bad, it's...just okay."
__label__1,"Bad....real bad...: Can't slow down was a huge disapointment for me...I really liked ""Through with being cool"" although it took a few listens for me to get used to it and I think ""Stay what you are"" is one of the best CD's I own.

__label__2,"I'm Glad I Decided to Ignore the Critics: I was going to see this movie on Friday, but after all the bad reviews I decided to wait for the DVD. Well, I was bored on Sunday and Lady in the Water was my best bet to kill some time. Believe it or not, I think this is one of M. Night's best films. It wasn't as confusing as people have said, and Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard turn in fantastic performances. There is humor, drama, and wonder throughout this two hour fantasy. The adults in my theater seemed to like it, though I think most teens will find the film's pacing very slow. I am glad I ignored the bad buzz and witnessed one of my favorite films of the year so far."

The writing is magnificent, and despite the range and depth and abundant detail, the material is unfailingly engaging and just plain fun."

This one takes the cake for the most boring. I like the idea they had with a new twist on Vampire flicks. The only problem was the execution, acting, and storyline sucked big time. I don't know how I didn't shut this mess off after 20 minutes into it. I guess I just figured it may pick up at some point. And apparently was very wrong. Total waste, don't even bother."

Not only is this one a measly 6 pages long, but the expressions don't match the words they've chosen--so you're effectively teaching your child incorrect words for a particular expression (nothing like making them unlearn things later!), and, while the editor clearly was intending to include a ""diverse"" set of babies, they ended up putting negative words next to both of the two black babies they included! Nothing like showing your little kiddo a darling black girl and saying ""yucky!"" as you read the text. Puhlease."

__label__2,"A Standout Golf Book!: Paging through this book it doesn't take long to recognize that Golf Training is no ordinary golf book. Instead of the usual stroke savers and swing tips common to the mass of generic golf books out there, Golf Training digs deeper into the fundamentals of mental training, fitness training, developing a good swing, and the keys to effective practice. This latter subject of ""how to practice most effectively"" is powerful, practical, and backed by what seems to be sound sports science. The author has done her research, and it shows in this clear, authoritative text. Though written by an LPGA pro, I found Golf Training to be a standout book that should help any golfer--male, female, high/low handicap--to play better. This is a glossy book, with many great action and instructional photos that support the text. A classy book and a great read!"

Unlike rap songs, these songs' lyrics sound like they've been written by HUMAN beings. Some people might not like this album because they're used to the somewhat '50's sounding music of these guys. To those people: RELAX, rap sounding music is not that bad!"

Even if you use the spray bottle diligently, the air inside dries out quickly because of the large side grates.

__label__2,Very special story: This book reads like a parable...the moral is timeless and the art work is stunning. A good children's book that exopses a new culture in a beautiful way.
__label__1,"BRUTAL, SEXUALLY GRAPHIC TRASH: This book is a disturbing combination of two very popular genres, romance and mystery. I enjoy reading an occasional romance and this one was highly recommended, so I gave it a try. I regret having finished it. It had all of the classic earmarks of a good simple romance, exotic local, feisty woman, handsome men...with one disturbing twist..graphic portrayals of violent, sexually perverse murders. Hardly the makings of enjoyable escapism. I worry that other readers weren't disturbed by the transition in one paragraph from the harmless titillation of a good sex on the counter scene to a vivid description of sexual stimulation induced by strangulation. If you enjoyed this book, you should probably see a therapist."

__label__1,"Kind of nice...: This is a Fantasy Game made into a comic. You have the Hero, the Bad Guys, the levels and secondary characters. There is a touch of humor, but most of it just didn't DO anything for me. The plot, like many a game I have played online, didn't go anywhere and it didn't go anywhere very, very SLOWLY. Frankly, Megatokyo or Misfile kept me interested til the last page and I am waiting for more volumes to come out so I can spend my cash on them. Those artists need to be supported.RPG World was like eating bland oatmeal. I had to remember to come back to it again and again to finally finish it off. And I am NOT waiting for the next volume. I DO not plan to spend my cash on any more of these discs. It just didn't click for me."

Sure, you will learn a trick or two, but I'd hate to perform with only this knowledge under my belt!And why, WHY do some authors insist on injecting their personal religious beliefs into what are supposed to be secular works? Evangelize in a book written to that purpose, please! About 2000 years ago someone said something about praying quietly and privately in one's own room . . .If you want to be a ventriloquist, there are plenty of sources far superior to this pap. Look for them."
__label__2,"Great narration, better then average story: The way the book is narrated by the main character was very compelling, and deftly weaved dark humor about three American families into a book I was reading for it's work as piece of historical fiction. As historical fiction goes, it was very good (a notch above Steve Berry) and it used flashback chapters much like the movie and TV series ""The Highlander"" did to add insight without breaking the tension of the story. The believability factor was good, but not outstanding, and I have to say that the main characters ability to make every woman he has ever been with reach a orgasm did stretch credulity :-) A fun read for His-fict, Shakespeare addicts, and movie buffs."
__label__2,"One of Koontz's best, for what that's worth.: With Lightening and Dragon Tears (is that the title? How they run together with time), this is the best of Koontz's work. It represents his mature style but was written before he got into his cookie-cutter-book-every-six-months 'superstar' phase. He does ride his social agenda excessively hard (he's about the right-wing libertarian equivalent of a Marion Zimmer Bradly in terms of lack of subtlety), but if you ignore that and read for entertainment you will not be disappointed. How could a two for the price of one serial-killer special go wrong in terms of suspense? And, of course, watch for the sympathetic All-American mutt and the creepy-crawly government agents."

I would expect them to handle the outdoor elements with no problems.Definitely have some spare mounting hardware available.All too often the screws that are provided for these brackets aren't galvanized. This causes a rusty drip line after being weathered.I'm not certain if these are galvanized or not, but I will say that the hardware that came with the bracket does appear to be low quality.There is a butterfly nut on the side of the bracket that allows you so securely tighten the flag pole in which you insert."
__label__2,"Bemis Digital Control Console Evaporative Humidifier - 4D7-800: This humidifier is a beast! It's about the size of a TV set. However, it's on casters, so you can easily roll it out of the way.When you get the fan really rolling, it moves some serious air. I'm not convinced it's evaporating as much volume of water as claimed, though, because the tanks sometimes last for days before needing a refill. Also, the ""empty"" indicator is very low-tech. It has already failed and we need to check the tanks periodically.But the bottom line is, our house was unbearable dry and now it's better. I can't argue with the price of the unit or the amount of electricity it uses. Overall, I prefer this wick/fan system over our old humidifier, which took lots of juice and shut off every time the heating element needed scraping to remove crusted-on minerals."
__label__2,A great read: This was an enjoyable read - a flawless depiction of the strggle between good and evil. I loved the story and found only the ending to be trite and contrived. The writing is beautiful and the characters became friends. I'd recommend to most anyone for the enjoyment.
__label__1,"Disappointing: Having read the other two ""Princess"" books, I found this particular book quite disappointing. While the personal growth and maturation that has taken place within Sultana is quite obvious on the one hand, on the other hand, this book seems to be a self-indulgent journey into the plight of a ""poor little rich girl."" While Princess Sultana's concern about women still comes through in the book, it comes through as more of a subtext underneath the more overarching tale of her life within the incredibly wealthy royal family, and her struggles with alcoholism. It focuses more on *her* and much, much less on the plight of women in Saudi Arabia. For this reason, it's not a book that I would particularly recommend to readers who enjoyed the first two books."
__label__1,"Bad Book. Period.: I'll keep this short. This book is not worth buying. At all. Half the book is descriptions of different fish and aquarium fauna. Most of the rest is information on equipment. And tacked on at the end, almost as an afterthought, are TEN pages of information on setting up and maintaining a saltwater aquarium. I'm not saying that this book doesn't have a plethora of information. But for someone like me, someone setting up their first saltwater aquarium and looking for beginner information, this book is seriously lacking."

__label__1,"when teachers become authors....: i used this book in my linear circuit analysis class at purdue, and it has been anything but a pleasurable experience. the text is somewhat confusing, providing little relevant information or examples which would allow anyone to complete the problems at the end of each chapter. the example problems in the book are too simple, and most people will be surprised at the complexity of some of the homework problems. answers are provided for only a select few of the homework problems, most being only partial answers at that. as a result, it is very difficult to apply anything you've learned from the chapter, or even to know if you're applying anything correctly. i would not suggest this book to anyone trying to learn the subject, it would probably only discourage you. my advice: get another book, or a tutor."
__label__1,"Boooring!: 636 pages jam packed from beginning to end with pure drivel. A must read for insomniacs. Zero action, but lots of descriptions of every meal for Jack Ryan.

__label__1,"Really really slow: I read this book so I could pick up HTML 5. I decided that I want to do some web pages and take a break from applications. HTML 5 looks fun. So I picked this book and this book has info but it really makes you grind through the book to get to it. It's really slow paced. I like how it has pictures, but there is limit. After a point it's like the book speaks to you like it thinks you take an hour to comprehend something. Just give a topic and move on. You don't need to drag something 5 times for another 50 pages, literally. I read 100 pages for the past 3 days and still have my webpage the same as it was in page one. Matter a fact, after page one you barely write code, you just grind read the same topic over and over again. This is first my review. I never thought I'd write a review, but seriously, how stupid do you think we are? We get it, move on. This isn't Jersey Shore."
__label__1,Expensive: This is incredibly over priced. You can buy this for a fraction of the cost at other websites Google it. Your over charging
__label__2,"Laughing and learning? Is that possible?: Yes it is. From the dedication in the front to the glossary at the back I laughed my way through and learned from this marvellous book. ""Dads, Toddlers and the Chicken Dance"" was given to me as a present when my daughter was born 2 weeks ago and it opened my eyes to a lot of experiences that I am about to go through but hadn't really thought about before. Its no nonsense approach is refreshing and it is laced with humour that keeps you reading. I'm rushing off to get ""So You're Going To Be A Dad"" just to keep me laughing! (and to see what I've missed out on!)"
__label__2,Nice packaging: This arrived very quickly and I like the convenience of individual packages. My chinchilla loves the dust and jumped right in. His coat is looking and feeling great.
__label__1,Bad buy: There's not much to say. This book sucks! Many code-errors and bad explanation. I think that the writer of this book searched for popular flash-words and made a book out of these words.There's a whole chapter on 3d... But not one sentense in the chapter is about making 3d. Well.. The author tells you what programs you make 3d with.It's the same with the website to the book. A nice un-updated site!But I'm impressed that such a book actually can be printed.
__label__1,"didn't last long: This itme is one of those tools I don't use often, but when I need it there is nothing like a good spindle sander to get around those curves. When I recieved it I was impressed with the way it was built, the nice storage for the extra spindles and the way it worked. I had no need for it really at the moment and after a couple test runs it sat in the corner. Last month I did need it and the nasty grinding sound coming from it did not bode well. The spindle would spin around but there was no oscillation at all. I cleaned everything up as best I could and it gave me a few half hearted movements and more grinding sounds. It is now sitting in the garage and I reclaimed my old spindle sander from my uncle. I was pleased to find out the sleaves fit my old one. I will use them."

The best reason is that it's the first time we get to see a star ship damaged, both internally and externally.Second, it's one of the best ""tongue in cheek"" spots for both Nimoy and Kelly.Third, if they were ever to REMAKE this scenario, or ever enhance the original (all you DS9 fans know what I am talking about) they could have a field day and get away with it!Not to mention, if it were remade, image that PLAYMATES toys could have a field day!I've lagged on enough, suffice to say that it's one of the best episodes from the classic series!"
__label__2,"This makes the book more fun!: I just got this a few days ago, but as soon as I got it I started listening to it. I soon came to realize I was pronouncing everything wrong! It was pretty funny. Now I've got my mom hooked to the story! I think Jim Dale is very talented- one nice thing is that even when a character is yelling, he doesn't blow out your ear drums. (I once listened to the Oddessey, and the reader did just that.) Also, you can understand evry word he says. Everyone has a different voice. Malfoy's really tells you what a creep he is. You really ought to get this tape!"
__label__1,"Statues, not figures.: I bought this when it first came out as it had the only Professor X figure at the time. Unfortunately, this Hall of Fame is just a collection of figures stuck to bases. You cannot remove them (from one of the product images you can see the results of someone who tried). It's fine if you're looking for a nice display, but if you want the actual toys you're bettery off looking for them one by one. Yes, I did end up returning this item."
__label__1,item never shipped: Product was to be del. by the 17th and still has not been shipped. They took my money and I have no product. Big Mistake! Gave one star bcuz that's the least I can rate.
__label__1,"stop the pretension: Please stop all the high brow posturing. All these reviews by people who are trying so hard to sound intelligent are tiresome. Sometimes a gifted band misses the mark and clearly any honest reviewer will admit that is the case with KID A. There are some interesting sounds and textures on KID A and obviously we are dealing with an extremely talented band. However, Thom and the boys forgot to craft those ideas into songs. This offering is a group of loosely arranged ideas eminating from long sessions playing around with machines and instruments. The real genius arrives when a band is able to craft their new sound and experimentation into classic songs, i.e. Achtung Baby. Radiohead needs to return to the studio with this material and finish the ideas started here. A clear dissapointment. Other reveiwers may disagree, but in the process, please do not argue that you have classic songs here. These are ideas, not songs. It is dishonest to suggest otherwise."
__label__1,"Too Much English. Not enough Italian: This DVD is heavy on the English and short on the Italian. It spends way too much time on the word ""ciao"" and cute skits(mostly in English) on its pronunciation. Meanwhile, it givesyou a very complicated set of rules (again primarily in English) for the pronunciation of vowels and consonant combinations which it whips through in blinding speed and are probably only appropriate for persons wishing to major in Italian as a career. Its very short on vocabulary building and you will learn only a very few words of Italian and Italian phrases. Its filled with fluff and skits which try to be cute (and usually fail) and are mostly in English. I really cannot recommend this DVD to anyone. You won't learn much Italian words and phrases from it."
__label__1,"Strangely, the game is better then the book.: Most of the time the book is better then the movie, etc.Not this time.Maybe it was my fault for playing the game through before reading the book, but this book was run of the mill fantasy dribble.I read it through in two days but i cant say that that was because of how enjoyable it was. I read it quick so i can move onto another book.As of right now the game can probably be got for as little as this book. If youre interested in DnD or Planescape, pick up the game. You wont be sorry.But stay away from this book!"
__label__2,"Works for me!: Mbele takes on the arduous task of comparing American and African cultural differences, focusing mostly on Tanzanian culture and customs - and he does this in less than 100 pages. Anyone interested in this topic will find mostly anecdotal comments and observations from someone who has spent time on both continents. In the end Mbele notes that people are different and that we should embrace and accommodate our differences as much as possible. This is a good book with good information to consider if you are traveling to Africa anytime soon or hosting an exchange student from Africa.I am traveling to Tanzania later this year as part of a faculty exchange program and found Mbele's comments and observations useful. I was very glad to discover that many Tanzanians appreciate good beer and that the overall pace of life is a bit slower than that found in the US. I'm was already looking forward to the trip and after reading this book I am even more excited. Asante sana Prof. Mbele!"

First of all, you can't drag and drop music onto the player--you have to use their lame software. To make it worse, the software is useless! It bases everything off a database within the player. This database doesn't look at file names--it only looks at MP3 ID tags. So if you've ripped any CD's that are a few years old, or have music that you downloaded a few years ago, the software won't recognize it. So, according to this software, I have 443 songs named ""No Title Found"" on my computer. Useless. Utterly useless. This was also a gift. I will never buy from these morons again. They should stop hiring sixth-graders to write their software."

But, when she veered off into the political arena, she offended those attending her 'seminar' on Paris. She made comparisons between the twin towers attack and Hiroshima. My family left in disgust. The book offers some bits and bobs on getting around in Paris which are nothing new and can be found in Let's Go Paris or Rough Guides. Don't waste your money on this book.

__label__1,"Shouldn't a CARS game be about racing?: I purchased this game for my CARS-obsessed 3-year-old son. However, I am very disappointed in it. Instead of being a racing game, it is a game that requires the player to solve ""puzzles"" and perform certain tasks. The only racing aspect of the game that we have been able to unlock is where Lightning McQueen races Chick Hicks (very boring when it is done over and over) and although this entertains my son the first 3-4 times, he becomes very bored with it. The other tasks on the game are okay but get quite boring too. However, we have since purchased CARS Mater-National and HE LOVES IT! Needless to say, this one hasn't been touched since we purchased Mater-National."

However, her life is not the only thing at risk, her reputation is as well. The only thing that will save that is a marriage that turns very convenient when passion turns it into a real one. No matter how great the heat between Rafe and Alix, it will take danger and testing to prove their love true.** Danger and passion fill this fast paced book. Alix seems a bit flippant and shallow at times, but Rafe has all the earmarks of a hero, albeit rakish. **Amanda Killgore"

I love AJ music but this isn't what a fan would hear from him. Reading the story about the concept of this album is clear that this is dedicated to his mother who like gospel music. I suggest for who wants to know AJ to listen to other album, except ""Let it be Christmas"". Waiting for a new work ..."
__label__2,"A fascinating tale: This newly reprinted edition of May French-Sheldon's travel narrative is a fascinating historical document for those interested in exploring the intersection of gender, class, nation, and race within the colonial context. Boisseau's excellent introduction to the volume unpacks why French-Sheldon, her discourses, and her practices/performances are worthy of historical inquiry. French-Sheldon's text provides a fascinating look at how gender and racial boundaries were being defined, policed and contested during the rise of colonialism, feminism, and an expanding capitalist system. Bousseau's introduction and notes are superb."

__label__1,"Hard to do simple tasks, but cheap price: The price was good; But it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to open a file, and another 5 minutes to save a file. I've been using the older versions of Office almost every day for a decade, and considered myself an expert in the tools, until the interface changed how everything is done. Maybe someday I'll discover a backwards compatible mode that lets me get work done; Till then I'm returning to the older version. An annoying feature is the big tool bar at the top, I have a wide screen monitor, and space at the top is precious, I wish the tool bar could be placed on the side where there is plenty of space to waste. Although I'm an engineer for the past 20 years, it took about 10 minutes to figure how to open the box; I've bought puzzles that are easier to figure out than this product.If you never used Office tools before, maybe this would be an OK version to learn, (once you figure out how to open the box)."

__label__1,"No; buy Symbol of Life: This album is getting good reviews here, and it's nice to see people still keen on Paradise Lost. Unfortunately, this album was ""lost"" on me. Their newest one, Symbol of Life, is an excellent album. It's dark and heavy and has incredible hooks. To me, Believe in Nothing sounded more like Nickelback. Yes, it's heavier than what they were doing for a while, but I find it pretty uneventful, and there's certainly nothing gothic about it."

__label__2,A realistic account of Indian mentality to discuss and argure.: The author brings out effectively the Indian tradition of peaceful debate on matters of social importance from ancient times till now. This tradition of positive argumentativeness seems to be the strength of Indian democracy's success inspite of some sectarian politics rampent now. Indian pluralism will survive Dr. Sen says by this nature of Indian minds. A very good book boldly written.MKV

There is no other book I have found that deals with this subject matter in such a poetic, thorough, yet unsentimental manner. It was especially useful prior to my first visit to Japan. It helped make sense of a simple but somewhat mystifying cultural tradition."

However, there are some dead spots which I wanted to remove, so got this signal booster.After installing it, I get full signal on the cell phone when im <1 feet away from the base station. However, anything beyond that, its the same signal. It does not work as said. I tried it for 2 days, didn't really see a difference in the service."
__label__1,"This ""film"" is pure, unadulterated trash.: This is a sick, cornball piece of amateurish trash, trying to masquerade as a sophisticated European slice-of-life. Tom Berenger notwithstanding, this film is junque. Life is precious; don't waste time, money, or effort on going to see this dribble; file it in #13."
__label__1,Good idea but poor quality: My daughter received this as a gift when she was almost 2 years old. The play sponge boxes that come with provide no value since they're just empty pieces of cardboard. This strings on the mop come off easily and make a mess all over the house. The apron strings are way too short for her to wear.
__label__2,"Daughter likes them, but they do creep up: Bought these for my daughter to run in, but she wears them under shorts because they tend to creep up a bit. She uses these the most as a layer under dresses and skirts, since I can't convince her to wear a slip."
__label__2,Brilliant Doctor: I think Dr Denmark is brilliant. I would recommend this book to all mothers. Her methods are tried and true.
__label__1,"Great phone but Sprint service is terrible.: I could not place an international call from my RAZR. At the end of the day, Sprint found that my phone was defective. It took me 3 weeks of hassle and dozens of calls to unfriendly customer service to get the phone replaced. It is a great cell phone but Sprint service is terrible. You may want to consider buying a RAZR from Verizon."
__label__2,"Man, oh, Man! Heavy and God Inspiring Crunchfest!: This is my first Living Sacrifice album. Man, I had no idea about these guys. The first awesome thing is the recording quality! Excellent...very crisp and clear...extreme clarity! That is so important with heavy music like this. The guitarists, and especially the drummer are absolutely outstanding. They play melodic, groovy, and speedfreaky! All with no mistakes. And their amp tones are marvelous. One thing that sticks out the most is their blatant Christian lyrics, which is sort of hard to find in this style of Christian music. I really think that that takes 'gonads' and earns my highest respects. I'd have to put this album up there with Extol's 'Burial' as the best Christian Death Metal put out recently!"
__label__2,"Love, love, love the Twilight Turtle: This turtle light is fantastic. It seems to be marketed to/for babies. My daughter is 4 1/2 and I highly recomend for children of any age. If fact, I wouldn't mind one myself.!!! It fills my daugher's room with stars and we change the color each night. My husband finds the constelations with her before bedtime and it's replaced story reading for the moment.Can say enough good things. Worth every penny."
__label__2,"Odds is quality everywhere: Many different vocal sound effects, wonderful, clean guitar arranged a la theatre support for the storytelling. This CD's quality was a surprise to a musician's ear. Story content is the best of life's lessons and the many voices Odds is able to assume made me laugh out loud--and I'm the parent. I will buy every Odds Bodkin CD for my children, 5 and 10."
__label__1,"A warning to Christain parents: Christain parents whose children may read this book, I would highly recommend that you read this trilogy before your children do. You should be prepared to discuss Pullman's series with your kids after they've read it. The premise of the trilogy is that the Christian God and his heavenly host are in a conspiracy to keep mankind enslaved. Indeed in Pullman's trilogy, the ""fallen angels"" are the force for good. Most Christian denominations would consider this story line to be questionable at best. I understand that Philip Pullman is an avowed atheist--one who doesn't believe in God--but what does one call someone who sides with the ""fallen angels?"""
__label__2,Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom: This is a must read for all who are interested in the issue of Slavery in the US.
__label__2,GREAT book!: My small womans group wanted to do a bible study on this book and at first I was against it because I felt like I wasn't anxious. After reading the first chapter I did a complete turn around! This book is VERY good! It really makes you look at your life in a different way and see what is really important and what really matters. I would recommend it to anyone!
__label__2,"very good: saw them live last month and they killed bands such as good charlotte, non point, cypress hill, bowling for soup, but one band tied with them and thats unwritten law they were awsome live also go check out there cd's"
__label__1,"Not for sensitive skin/eyes: Strong aroma which takes maybe 10 minutes to fade. But after about 1/2 hour, my eyes started burning. Skin feels smooth, but not worth the other effects."
__label__1,"Really bad customer service.: I've been a loyal customer of Lodge cookware for twenty years. I bought nearly their entire line of cookware, and have promoted their cookware every chance I got. Lodge is family owned. They have really bad customer service. I bought a brand new Wok, that rusted before I ever used it. I asked them if I could return the never used Wok, and asked if they could send me a new one at cost. They refused. Most customer service departments would do more to help a loyal customer."
__label__1,"Great Flashlight (at first): Although this flashlight is compact it is rugged, bright and very useful in tight spaces. The head has 2 positions to adjust the light beam. It also has a high quality switch making it difficult to turn on by accident in your pocket. Review update!After 3 months the switch quit working, it is now usless. so much for high quality :/"
__label__1,"Ok- An extra star because it looked nice on the counter...: Isn't this a cute and stylish timer? That's what I thought when I bought it...but as a timer it's useless. The buzzer is so faint and short, that you have to be standing nearby in the kitchen to hear it. Tonight I burned what would have been a wonderful pie because I was in another room when this weak buzzer sounded-and I didn't hear a thing.I've had it! I've just ordered the Oregon Scientific digital timer to replace this cheap thing."
__label__2,"Good table for small places.: This table was perfect for my small apartment, it fit into a small ""dinning area"" and still left some room to maneuver around it. It is easy to assemble. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish the table legs were a little larger (diameter wise) more so for looks as opposed to functionality."
__label__2,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!: AWESOME CD!!!!!!!!!! and the good part is is that it sounds like classic Jane's Addiction. BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1,"a college thesis without depth of experience: I read this book just after returning from 12 years in Japan studying Butoh dance and Rinzai Zen.I was hoping this book would trigger my inspiration in how to articulate and explain this inexpressible art formIn a way which others can at least catch a glimpse of the transiency and beauty of Butoh.I was left disappointed because it became quite clear that words directly correlate with ones experience. Just as the great Zen Masters can write in a way that captures their clear mind. If someone only writes analytically from the point of view of an observer- than it's clear it's purely information and cannot touch the true heart of Butoh. That being said, this little book is, in a way, an homage to butoh and any/ all fingers pointing to this indefinable artform deserves a 'gassho'"
__label__1,"Relive the Movie by Memory: I was somewhat disappointed that the CD was predominantly instrumental, but on the other hand as one listened, the music moved you emotionally through each scene of the movie. A strange and different way to experience the ""Titanic"" movie."
__label__2,"Well worth the wait!: Despite its length, this book is an easy read, with a gripping plot and great character development. It builds well on the previous four installments and delves deeply into Harry's psyche, so that the reader can almost feel Harry's growing anger right along with him. It is a dark book, with a sense of foreboding throughout much of it, but even so there are moments of laugh out-loud humour! Rowling's writing is as good as - if not better than - the earlier books and pulls the reader along. After nearly three years of waiting for this book, I can say I was very happy with it. It was well worth the wait!"
__label__1,"Puhleeeze.: This silly tripe beat ""Braveheart"" for the 'best original screenplay' oscar? Give me a politically correct break."

I was very happy that It was stated on the box that it came with a drain in the bottom to get rid ot the water. Much to my dismay, after a fun day in the pool there was no drain to let the water out... The pool is now in the storage room in sea of spider webs!"
__label__1,"I wish.....: I wish Dakotta Fannings character got caught by the aliens so we would never have to hear her scream again.I wish that Speilberg had the rocks to kill off a main character, double so because he made the main character choose and therefore would have to live with these choices.I wish these special effects were used for another, better, movie.I wish that I could have my time back.Save yourself."
__label__2,"recomendado al 100 %: Definitivamente este es uno de los mejores covers que he encontrado para mi note. Ajusta a la perfección, tiene un bonito diseño y es muy cómodo. El material es lo suficientemente grueso para protegerlo y a la ves no le da más volumen al teléfono. Excelente producto."
__label__1,"Big disappointment: I purchased these after reading favorable reviews. These knives are dull,very dull and need sharpening (not just honing) before using. They are not usable as is and are a total waste of money. Save your money and sharpen your old knives. I purchased a set of Freud knives from ecom earlier and they are outstanding. I highly recommend spending the extra money for the Freud. This is my first and last CMT product. The only good comment I can make about the CMT knives is that you can handle them without any fear of cutting yourself."
__label__1,"false: About Babji we can trust only one source - Yognanda.This book is poor copy of Yogananada account, and is very much imagination of author.It is not so difficult to see that behind the story there is not any weight of experience, but hearsay."
__label__1,"I wish I had the option to give ZERO stars: What a disappointment...Seeing such positive reviews from other buyers made me actually think that this album might actually be halfway decent. I sure was wrong. What a waste of time, money, and plastic. The artist is attempting to use Fleetwood Mac's name in order to gain fame. It looks as if that's his only chance, though, since there is obviously NO talent here whatsoever.My advice: avoid at all costs!"
__label__2,"Video Outstanding but...: I have no problems with the excellent video tours of some of the world's finest springs. However, I believe that a narration would have been better than the chosen background music. To me, it's actually distracting. Watch it with the sound off."
__label__2,"Nice cheap headphones.: I bought these very cheaply at a discount store, for use with my laptop, because earbuds hurt my ears after a while. These headphones are collapsible, which is a plus, but the plastic seems flimsy, which is a minus. I don't think they'd survive being sat on by accident.The sound is surprisingly good, even on bass! I've only had these for 2 weeks, so I can't attest to longevity. I was going to give 3 stars, but added one more because of the price. For < $10, I can't ask for more."
__label__1,"Brother is Very Unreliable: Years in the IT industry and much experience with Brother MFCs going back years. Always recommended their products -- until now. Got the dreaded ""Machine Error 41"" on my MFC3420C. And it eats ink like crazy, even when not used (cleaning function) -- very expensive. Another lousy feature is that if you are out of any of the three colors of ink (magenta, cyan, yellow), then you cannot print in black, even when you have plenty of black ink. So even when you never use color, you still must regularly buy and replace colored ink.Stay away from Brother. They used to be a quality company, but no more. There are other more reliable MFCs out there."
__label__1,"Disappointing: These seemed like a great idea to use on the motorcycle, even though I saw the one less than enthusiastic review for that application. Bolstered by the other thumbs ups, I decided to give it a shot. I have both the Midland GXT710 GMRS and the 75-822 CB, and after contacting Midland about their wiring and respective headset/mics I grafted the Midland 22-540 headset's connector (that headset is impossible to use with a 1/2 shell helmet) to this headset using keyboard-style mini-DIN connectors so I could swap the headset between radios using their own cables and PTT switches. The mic output is really low even for the GMRS radio it is designed for. I thought it might be my soldering, but the identical operation was noted using the second, unmodified headset. The mic on radio itself was much louder. Pretty much a waste of money in my opinion."
__label__2,"Happy with the Toshiba Gigabeat: Likes: Very light weight, long battery life, great sound, good value.Dislikes: Small screen."

__label__2,"Plantronics Explorer 320 Bluetooth headset: I have this unit paired with an LG 8300 and performance is excellent. It fits nicely in the ear and has very good volume. Easy one button function. Slightly larger than the latest headsets, but not significantly."
__label__2,"A great, quick read for anyone: A great, quick read for anyone - you don't need to consider yourself an entrepreneur to get something out of this book. It contains not just business lessons but life lessons as well. I highly recommended this book. If you are wondering if you should get this book, let me say that it is a delightful book, easy to read and the stories will make you smile. However, I see a bigger reason, because if you want to succeed in business (or in life for that matter) you will need to know how to solve problems and make people happy. Employees are encouraged to think with their own heads, use their own voices and words, and decide for themselves how best to please a customer, rather than read from canned scripts and act from a limited list of options."
__label__1,"Very disappointing read, after hearing all of the hype.: After hearing loads of excitement surrounding this novel, and the much acclaimed Broadway musical that followed, I was anything but impressed with this read. I kept waiting for something, anything to happen. The climax never truly comes when reading the book, and it's a very flat tone through to the end. I would not personally recommend this book to anyone."
__label__2,"This is the best movie that I ever saw!!: I think this is the best movie I ever saw!! I really think so..I saw it in the cinema for free and I think all the actors where doing a great job, also Peter Weir did a great job. I really like movies with Jim Carrey, I think he is the best ! bye bye!! Emmy van Swaaij"
__label__1,Fell apart in 3 days: I got this for my 5 y/o son for his birthday. He used it three times and parts starting falling out. The scooter is not able to lock closed or open. I am disappointed.
__label__2,"Concise, informative and organized: The book covers almost all aspects of solid waste management with excellent presentation: regulations, waste characteristics, collection and transfer, landfill, recycling and recovery, thermal destruction, and chemical and biological transformations. Although it does not discuss all the design details of the disposal alternatives, it is one of the most comprehensive coverage in solid waste management. Strongly recommended."
__label__1,"Not what it appears to be: I bought these, and the concept is better than the delivery. When you fix it the box only looks 1/3 full. Makes me wonder why they did not just use a smaller box. Anyway the flavor was OK, but the salt is a little high for me."
__label__2,"Great Thermos but BIG: Keeps your coffee nice & hot! I took it to work one day and didn't get a chance to drink it, the same day my husband forgot his Stanley thermos on the counter. I got home and measured the temperature in both, mine was 145 degrees 10 hours later, his was 103.My only gripe with this thermos is the size. I thought I would like the 30-whatever ounce size because I usually drink a couple of good sized cups a day, but it turns out to be too much for me. I end up only filling it half way or dumping the leftover out when I get home. I wish I would have purchased the next smaller size, the 20-something size instead."
__label__2,"AT THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST: this CD is real STP, testosterone driven hard rock, makes little sense lyrically but the overall feeling is empowerment. Two kinds of tracks on this album. Hard powerful songs or filler in between those songs to let that ringing in your ear subside. ""Creep"" is the only real attempt at mellow artistry. A few annoying songs, but mostly good stuff. Too bad STP didn't continue with the same sound after this album."
__label__2,Excellent!: I read it in no time! It's extremely entertaining...just keep in mind he is a Latin American writer more specifically Colombian and I the reviewer am Colombian as well!

__label__1,Zia toner: Beware. I received something different than what I ordered. Seems they don't carry the pictured product anymore.
__label__2,"Improved with Age: I don't know why, but I didn't like this show as a kid. Now, I love it. It's a great show to watch with the family. It's wonderful to see cop cars with real lights and real sirens, manual typewriters, and dial telephones. The sound effects do crack us up - no car ever pulls up to or away from the curb without screeching the tires. The stories are really the best part. They click along, are interesting, and there is no question about who the good guys and who the bad guys are.ofs"
__label__2,"A few problems: Pros: Nice video quality, cool scrolling, fairly easy program for transferring music, great price for the space & quality.Cons: I am not 100% sure, but so far it's like every other player in that, if a song says it's a certain album, it will list the artists by however the song is programmed to consider it. Even after modifying the files in the program they don't sync properly on the device.I don't like that a lot of my music videos didn't sync, which I assume is a compatibility issue.You can't do much, anything really, from the device itself. You have to do all your modifications in the program. I like the auto-sync but it can become a pain since you add songs to the program from folders. So you can't just put one or two songs on without putting them into a folder.Most of this is pretty much universal mp3 player problems but it's too bad they weren't addressed."
__label__1,"They don't want to be here: Tom and Ray are a lot of fun on the radio but seem uncomfortable here. Maybe because they are guests.Awkward jokes like ""My brother's been responsible for a lot of personal wind"" and ""If we tell you the answer, we'll have to kill you"" might have been funny once upon a time but don't hold up.Lots of great info in the narration..""1% of a cars energy is used to move the driver"" Lovens claims 3 1/2% later. ""People buy heavy cars because they feel safer in them"" Which raises the unanswered question, ""Are we safer?"" Nice race car crash footage. Was the driver protected by carbon fiber?Great graphics! If you are interested in the subject, look for FutureCars on Discovery."
__label__1,"Lole Eco Top: The product was poorly represented. The fabric was uncomfortable and description of product incomplete. However, shipping was very fast, and when I returned the item, I had no difficulties."
__label__2,"Love it: This motor is strong and not ridiculously noisy considering I use it to do everything from mix dough to make nut butter. The blades that come with it do pretty much everything I need. i am able to clean it in the dishwasher. I would suggest getting the blade storage accessory with it.The last cuisinart I had lasted through my grandmother and myself (20+yrs.). I have high hopes for this one, too."
__label__2,"Right Place, Right Time: I came to this book from the perspective of someone getting its brand ready to take its first tentative steps overseas. Anholt has provided a vital resource for anyone wishing to do the same, especially in these times of overnight global dotcoms.Heartily recommended."
__label__2,"Best Dog Food Ever: After bouts with Pancreatitis in both of my schnauzers (neither are overweight, but have major sensitivities to fat content), this is the only food I can feed them without worrying if it's right for them. It has no corn, which is fantastic--unlike other cheaper brands. It might be $10 more than you're used to spending on dog food, but it is worth it. They are your family and deserve to eat as well (or better--haha) than we do. I love my dogs more than anything which is why I will only feed them this. (They love it too!!)"
__label__1,would not buy: Yes this was easy to install. But who wants to install it over several times. I put this on my Toyota Tacoma and it lasted about 18 months before it burned out inside and back fed the trucks wiring system. Spent a cold winter afternoon trouble shooting what was wrong since nothing was corroded and I had done a very good job of installing it. But it had shorted out inside and was hot to the touch. Cheaply made in Mexico. Wish I had bought something better.
__label__2,"Good, but not necessarily for the zodiac: This is the first book I've found that attempts to link possible interpretations of archealogical finds with the myths and foreign commentary of the Celts. It is a bit difficult to follow, but it certainly had me thinking in a new way."
__label__1,"A Very BIG Disappointment: This is the lamest book I've seen in ages. I mean, the storyline is much too boring. I'm a big fan of Sweet Valley Jr. High, and decided to try out this brand-new series. I have to say that I was definitely disappointed. I seriously do not recommend this book. I read the first one, and found that at least a teensy weensy bit better. But I have to say, I want SVU BACK!!!!!"
__label__2,"vtech phones: Excellent product, I have set them both up (two units) in separate location in my home, one upstairs one downstairs. Clarity is great!"
__label__1,"Seller shipped me the DIRTY VERSION: The one star by no means signifies the quality of the album, but is based on the fact that I received the dirty version of the album when I ordered the CLEAN version. I love Ma$e but I don't love expletives, in fact I only listen to clean versions of rap records, so when Village Music World shipped me the dirty version, I didn't even listen to the record anymore. Hopefully the next time I order, I'll get the right product. Will never give them a cent of my money again."
__label__1,"Why buy 3 cartridges when the PSP version will have all the breeds on ONE DISC?: Hello people, save your money! WAIT FOR THE PSP PORT OF NINTENDOGS. Why buy 3 Nintendogs DS cartridges to get all the breeds when, from what I've read and heard, the PSP version of Nintendogs will have all breeds on one UMD disc?!? (that's the beauty of optical media, all 3 breeds can fit onto one UMD disc rather than having to use 3 SEPERATE cartridges, as is seen in the DS version of Nintendogs).So my advice is wait for the PSP version of Nintendogs. You'll only have to buy one UMD disc rather than 3 seperate cartridges (as is seen in the DS iteration of the game)....thus you'll have spare money to boot."
__label__2,"Where's Bluey?: Although I bought this CD and would probably buy it again, I would have to give this CD a four star rating.. I'm basing this mainly against her previous explosive work with Incognito's Jean-Paul 'Bluey' Maunick.. I'm sorry but those two are a deadly combination and should never be separated.. You just can't get any better with song's like ""Operator"" or ""Pieces of a Dream"".."

__label__2,The Essence of Lightfoot: Gordon Lightfoot gives his all in his Greatest Hits CD. The music takes you to another place of quiet and relaxation. All of his talents are presented solely in this CD.
__label__2,Holiong her interest more now that she's older: We've had these dvds for 3 yrs. This one has recently been my daughter's favorite. She's 5 now and appreciates that the poses are ABC related and in order. She likes making the animal moves and it just adds to the other 2 in the series. Great for kids...keeps them active and engaged.
__label__1,"NOT an SACD: ecom needs to update their listing of their Stones discs. This and the others like it are NOT SACDs (ecom states they are hybrid SACDs). Not true. They are DSD remasters on CD. Big difference. I'm only keeping it because I didn't own the disc anyway. Buyer beware.Two stars is for the deceptive description, not the music."
__label__2,"Another Good Read: Very suspenseful and well-written...it kept me up all night because I just had to finish it.However, unlike the author's other books, I thought it was very easy to figure out, and it left me disappointed that I had been right about the identity of the murderer all along. There were quite a number of ways she could've gone to really surprise me, and I felt a bit cheated that she took the one I thought was the most obvious. It also seemed as if the conclusion was rushed compared to the rest of the book.Still a great read, and I highly recommend this author."
__label__2,"Easy to assemble: The Universal Leveler was easier to assemble than I expected. Drilled the holes, attached levelers, tighten, and go. They work great. I should have purchased years ago."
__label__2,"Just got it.: I got it and opened it up. The jar is smaller than it looks in the picture, and I'm hoping lasts a month. After opening the bottle, I smelled the pills immediately. The smell isn't too horrible IMO, but it definitely is not remotely pleasant.I knocked off a star due to the shrinkwrap around the jar (you'll need a knife to cut it) and the smell of the pills.I will write another review after using this for a while."
__label__2,"Earth Science for 5th Graders: I teach 4th and 5th grade science to a group of urban and multicultural students. This is the first DVD I have seen that effectively addresses Earth Science content that will appeal to the age group and to English learners. The program has chapters on all of the key ES concepts and provides a quiz to test knowledge which includes some test taking tips.The characters are funny and add songs to aid in understanding. They have Italian and New York accents (my background) so I can introduce my California kids to East Coast style.After this review, I'm writing the company to request a similar program for 4th/5th Life Science. It must have been designed by middle school science teachers, because it hits the mark perfectly."
__label__1,"Great book, extremely poor editing job: I personally love JS Mill and wanted a copy of these essays to catch up on some of his works that I am not as familiar with. The issue is not his writing or the book itself, it is the editing. There are a dozen misspellings, missing words, run-ons, and other anomalies that are not from JS Mill. It honestly looks like someone translated it into Chinese and then had someone retranslate the book back to English with minimal Chinese understanding. Don't buy this copy: find one for a couple bucks more and purchase that one."
__label__2,Fall Guy 1st Season was tremendous! Highly recommended!: This 1st season series was fantastic. Unfortunately seasons 2 - 5 are not yet available on DVD. Whoever decides DVD production of this series should immediately put the other 4 years as soon as possible. Those buying only the first season are hanging by a thread to see the rest of them!
__label__1,"it fit - but it broke after one wash!: The plastic thing that you use to adjust the strap broke - I can't wear it and don't know how to repair it -- and since I've already worn/washed it, I can't return it.I gave it a couple of stars because it did fit well..."
__label__1,"Awful, absolutely awful: This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was definitely a movie where a couple of Hollywood guys got together and said let's make a movie with all of our untalented friends in it. Vince Vaughan and Favreau are buddies, and, moreover, Vaughan and the director (Peter something - the guy who played the kid in A Christmas Story back in the 80's) have supposedly been friends since childhood. That's what this is, a bunch of friends together making a very bad movie. The acting is some of the most sophomoric and poor that I've seen since my 6th grade Christmas play."
__label__1,"ZERO STARS, STAY AWAY: I wish there was a space for zero stars. We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died. It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing. Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently. Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do."

__label__1,"Upsetting: I would not recommend this book to parents because of the strong reliance on corporal punishment it suggests. If you make children behave by hitting them, what do you do when they become too big to hit?In general, the techniques taught in this book go against everything the American Psychiatric Association suggests. Their studies find that children treated in this manner will be more likely to act out and rebel against authority. Just because all children who are hit do not have problems does not mean that many of them don't. Another warning: a woman who accidentally killed her foster child claimed that she was following the instructions in this book. Overall, not a good guide to raising emotionally healthy children."

__label__2,"The key word is ""intimate"": More than just a book about the plague this is a very well written history in a number of areas...First- a very intimate look at the plague itself- where it came from, how it spread in minute details...Second- a very detailed account of everyday life during this period throughout each affected geographic area. This information is both amazing and important to an overall understanding of the course of history...Third- the aftereffects and the learnings that all of us can take from this very devestating time in history.The key is that the text is extremely easy to read and very well documented. Its a history that reads as a great story unfolding."
__label__1,"Simply the Worst Book Ever: Reading this book is by far the most boring thing I have ever done in my enitre life. I would rather poke my eyes out than ever read this book again. The plot consists of a girl named Afrika, a slave who is trying to escape to Canada. Simultaneously, a completely unneccesary, boring side plot is thrown in about a girl named Lucy, who is a selfish brat who cares only about herself. The entire book she complains about her sister's wedding. Only during the last few pages does Lucy contribute anything at all to the main plot. If not for Lucy, this would be a mediocre book. Whatever you do, stay clear from this book."
__label__2,"Good Camera: I think the DCS-950G wireless internet camera is a pretty good camera for the money and was easy to setup and configure. You need a basic understanding of networking in order to take advantage of all the features. For example, to access the camera remotely you need to be familiar enough with your wireless router to create port mapping between your public address (provided by your ISP) and your internal addresses provided by your wireless router. The feature I would like to see added is the ability to choose to receive an AVI or jpg file when receiving alerts. I find receiving 1MB AVI files to be a bit much when a simple snapshot would do the trick.All in all, I would recommend this camera to anyone with basic knowledge of home networking. Video quality is very good. Upgrading the firware was easy too."
__label__2,"The Best Vorkosigan Novel: I came late to this series, and had serious doubts about all the awards its author has won after reading Shards of Honor. Luckily, I bought the 2-in-1 ""Cordelia's Honor"" and forged ahead anyway into Barrayar. Wow. Now that was worth the praise. Then I advanced to Warrior's Apprentice and was further amazed. Could the author continue to churn out action packed smartly written comedy slash adventure slash dramas? She can. She has. Sure there are dips. I found Cetaganda a bit lifeless. But the other books are predominantly very strong and impressive.Mirror Dance is the culmination of all that came before. Seeing the Vorkosigan's from Mark's perspective is like meeting them all over again. Watching him become human in the face of his newfound family's integrity and acceptance is incredibly moving. I can't lavish enough praise on this series or this book."
__label__2,"Still the best: Helicores are the standard choice of anyone who plays hard-charging country and/or bluegrass fiddle. It's amazing how well these strings blow away any other sets I've tried. I use them on my new violin, as well a vintage and an electric. After a couple minor adjustments they feel great and stay in tune in all kinds of weather. They hold up well and last a long time. I only wish that D'Addario would have this kind of quality in their guitar and mandolin strings. EXP's feel awful and the last set of EJ-16's I had on my guitar tarnished and turned black after one month. Helicores are the only D'Addario product I'll purchase in the future, when I can afford them."
__label__1,NFG: I bought these today liking the over the ear and colapsable feature which i was looking for. Absolute garbage. The volume is just not there and the bass is not what the packaging says. They are comfortable but not worth the money. I am extremely dissapointed. I will return them as soon as I can for a full refund or exchange. I advise everyone to stay away from these headphones. They are not good at all!! I give them -5 stars! 0 stars rating is not offered.
__label__2,"This is a great match!: ""Concentration"" is one of those games that you can learn in about a minute... then spend the rest of your life frustrated by it.The classic 'find the matching squares' concept taken to the next level. After you find the match, you have to try and solve the picture puzzle hidden behind the squares. The game is loads of fun and Endless had done a great job of making this a worthwhile addition to your game library."
__label__1,"so much disappointment in one book....: Given the author's credentials, I had high hopes for this book and was extremely disappointed. The plot is trite and see-through, with no driving sense of urgency or tension (exactly who cares if Edward does or doesn't find the Codex? A Duke? A Duchess? ho hum.)The characters were immature and so poorly developed I had trouble feeling remorse or joy for anyone in this book. You want to root for the good guy, you know? But in Codex, it was...who cares? The writing style was completely overwrought--I felt I should be wringing my hands at every turn of the page. The settings were repetitive and boring (library, apartment, library, apartment) And finally, the pages and pages and pages of computer gaming were so mind-numbing, I wanted to cry in agony (while wringing my hands, of course.) Not sure I can give this author another chance."
__label__2,"Thank God there's a place ""ware"" I can find this on CD: Great album from great singer. I first heard it just a few weeks ago when I found an original 1979 cassette copy from a place near my house that specializes in records and old tapes. In almost no time the disco-ish ""What's Your Name"" became one of my very favorite songs."
__label__2,Not Bad Considering Age: Great tunes. Stones at their career peak with the best lead guitarist they've had - Mick Taylor. The video could be a lot better BUT considering it's age it's more than acceptable.
__label__2,Don't miss this sleeper!: Our family has watched this over and over. We lost or first copy from letting someone borrow it. I had to buy a replacement .Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman shine. Great life lessons taught. Magical!
__label__1,Don't Waste your Money: I have had several indoor outdoor thermometers and this isn't worth your time or money. Clock never was correct no matter how many times I would set it. The outdoor temps only showed for about 2 or 3 days then quit altogether.
__label__1,"Creative Lab Products Not Worth Any Serious Money!: I am a tech person and have owned 4 MP3 players. I still have two of them including this door stop. As with everything Creative Labs has produced since the sound blaster sound cards, they can't get it right and eventually other companies enter the field and push them out. Now to the player. It worked for 4 months with a few formats and installations but it would constantly corrupt the music files. Eventually I had the same problem most users have with the player - the on button wouldn't work. I paid too much for this 128 mb player and will never buy another Creative Lab product if it costs over $20. I still need a smaller player so I am looking at CNET recommendations and will probably go with the RIO NITRUS. Don't waste your money on this player."
__label__1,"try Kossoy Sisters Bowling Green instead...: Completley agree with a customers reveiw from 1998, as it was pretty much what I was going to say. I was kinda shocked when I read the song listings, the Kossoy sisters pretty much did do the ""original"" of this album in the early 50's...I'm thinking? Bowling Green is worth a look in if you are looking for a more traditional slant on these songs. After sampleing it's just not my cup of tea, so sorry to all who love it, but I won't be adding Herst's attemts to my collection."
__label__1,"RAMPAGE is better: Poor video, poor.... very bad filming, very boring boulders problem....is short video...don't buy it ther are other videos better than this one...trust me! :-)"
__label__1,"Looks fun, but poorly made.: I've wanted one of these for over a year, and my wife just gave me one for christmas. The cd player works well but that's about it.- The radio dial looks nice but is difficult to read, and difficult to dial into stations on either end of the spectrum.- The tape player has no buttons. No ff, rw, stop or pause. Push the tape in and it plays right away, and you have to eject it to stop. Lame.- The phonograph never worked. When I set it to ""phono,"" the needle sounded live but table wouldn't turn. And it was brand new. Super lame.So basically, the one I got was a great looking piece of crap. Better luck to you!"
__label__1,Not reliable: Im sure it is a great product but despite reading instructions I can't seem to get the same reading on temp twice. Really wish I can return it but apparently I only had 30 days to do so.
__label__1,"breaks easily: This item looks like a good idea, but in practice, it's not much good. All it takes to break it is to pull the trailer far enough for the wheel to make one revolution, and the round 1/2"" steel arm that fits through the ""lug latch"" breaks where a small steel pin is installed. The device can then be removed easily from the wheel and discarded. Bye bye trailer."
__label__1,"Barely worth the effort: Although I was interested enough to finish the story, I felt it had been a waste of time when it was over. Everything happened so conveniently. It was highly predictable and a little too neatly concluded. Really not worth the effort."
__label__1,NOT the complete Deadwood: HBO cheated its customers with this series. When viewing figures were not high enough for them it ended the series with what must be one of the most unsatisfying final episodes ever seen. There was talk of a separate feature film that would wrap up the series properly but it looks as if that won't happen. Personally I have given up watching a lot of TV series because you simply never know when the producers will pull the plug and leave the viewer in mid plot.
__label__2,"This is for Cool People Like No Secrets: I love that band and I would donate Play to Salvation Army. Play is what I call TRASH.No Secrets is the best all the way and no one will call it chicken and people will belive me. My favorite song is ""Thats What Girls Do."" It is in one of my favorite movies which is THE POWERPUFF GIRLS MOVIE. No Secrets is all I can concentrate on and not Play because they are TRASH and Play needs to improve on singing BIG TIME! I just love No Secrets alot! Drop Play and get No Secrets from JIVE Records."
__label__1,not as expected: I got this set as a gift and used it once . There are so many scratches on the bowl because of tossing the salad which I did not think it will happen.
__label__2,Wind won't blow it away: This arrived just in time for the first rain storm of the season. Stayed in place through high winds and was easy to secure with the velcro at the bottom. Nice and heavy - covered my large sized grill perfectly. Very nice quality.
__label__1,"Below Average Read: In this fantasy adventure quest, the orphan hero, Rokey, was raised in a monastery. After an accident occurs, Rokey leaves his home and explores Firma. He is almost robbed when a elf named Flaskamber saves him.Rokey joins the Elf's group of friends led by Stanford. There is also Fia the bard and Lorq the giant. Soon they are attacked by ratmen, who are after Rokey. Why would they be after this orphan?The Orphan's Quest is your typical fantasy with all the clichés that go with it. The only thing that stands out is that the main hero, Rokey, is gay, and there is a romance between him and Flaskamber. I'm sure that fantasy fans will like this novel, but it really didn't interest me. Many of the questions that rises in the book are unanswered by the disappointing ending."
__label__1,"Not very happy: I agree with the other reviewer that this book has topics that tend to repeat. Also, I took the practice test and was very disappointed. Many questions weren't covered in the text and I couldn't even take a guess. For example: test question asked the # of chromosomes in a cell, no where in the text does it ever review that. I could go on and on with other items. Also I found many of the topics not clearly defined and had to google to get a better understanding. Then there were topics like inductive method that had 6 paragraphs of explanation and one paragraph for deductive method. Many topics were overly wordy and I think the author sometimes forgets who the audience is, some of us aren't scholars."
__label__1,"Radio Antenna: The unit looked all intact. Although it did not fit the car I ordered it for. The wireing is different, and the antenna wire has the wrong end on it, both ends are males. To make this unit work I will have to trouble shoot the wirering to find the hot and ground wire then slpice the antenna wire together. This unit was sold as a replacement unit for a 1998 fire bird antenna and it is not."
__label__2,"WOW!: My husband and I have watched the DVD numerous times, usually with the sound turned up so it feels like we're back in Atlanta at the live concert. Josh and crew put on a stunning performance and it was captured on the DVD. It's so fantastic that I'm afraid we'll wear it out so I've purchased multiple copies to make sure we'll always have one."

__label__1,"Audio Book: John Berendt is a wonderful writer. It is a damn shame that a wonderful reader could not be found to perform the audio book version of ""The City of Falling Angels"". Holter Graham (the reader) has a breathy, distracting, sing-song voice that made me want to stab myself with a fork. I couldn't get past disc 3, despite being interested in the story. Don't bother with this audio book unless you can tolerate a whispery 90's performance poet in your ear for 13 endless hours."
__label__1,"Interesting but unreadable: A perfect example of how an author's personal style can destroy a very interesting book. With tiresome convoluted sentences', and glib and painfully clever writing. It reads like it was written by a very erudite French courtesan of the era. I stuck with it for 100 pages. But this book is just unreadable. It's really a shame because the content is great."
__label__2,"Greatest of all times.: Of course everyone knows that this album is a masterpiece. It's Lauyrn's greatest work. Regardless what people say about Lauryn Hill she is remarkable. She's like no other human being ya know. I love the Miseducation of Lauyrn Hill, this is my 5 time buying the cd, the first 2 times someone stole it from me and the other 2, I wore the cds out listening to them so much."
__label__2,Solid Pump: This is a heavy duty pump. Extremely happy with it so far. It is solid cast iron and is very quiet. Did a lot of investigation on sump pumps and the Zoeller pumps always rose to the top. If you need a reliable pump this is the one for you.
__label__1,"Not your typical, mellow Zamphir: If you're looking for the easy, romantic music that Zamphir is known for then you should avoid this CD. This contains some of the most nerve-wracking, jittery music I have ever heard - guaranteed to set your teeth on edge. If you're looking for something that will give you the sensation you've just consumed a full pot of espresso or a case of Jolt cola then this would be what you're looking for. Otherwise, get one his other albums. I give it one star because it was cheap enough so I didn't mind shelving it after just one play."
__label__1,"Would Be Hard to Recommend This Book: I have read many of JP's books and find this is not one of his fast-paced, keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting to turn the next page books. It has several implausible, seeming contrived ideas (microwaving entire dormitories!). The main character has suffered the loss of all his immediate family and a wife he cherishes by terrorists, but quickly takes up with an old girlfriend who is also (unbeknownst to him) one of the bad-guys. Seemed very contrived and a bit stereotypical, i.e. all the Jewish Holocaust survivors in the book had become wealthy and internationally known personages. We all know this wasn't (isn't) the case."
__label__2,Great!: Singing about the colors is a great way to learn in any language. I bought this cd among others and 2yrs old knows his colors in spanish and english.
__label__1,"Flat Overprice BubbleWrap: This was the worst bulk order..yes I ordered 4 boxes...I am so disappointed! The bubble wrap is flat every other cell...in all 4 boxes. This is not the same product I have purchased in the past, even though I clicked on my purchases to order it. Completely different. BAD!!!!! Do Not Buy. The seller offered a refund of purchase price, but not for shipping...and wanted me to pay to ship them back. As we all know, the shipping back would have cost more than keeping the items, so I kept them , but will NEVER order this item again or from the seller. POOR RESPONSE!"
__label__2,Wonderful Book!: This is a fun book that is interesting for anyone to read. It is well designed because there are journal entries as well as informative articles written by the author on every page. The illustrations are full of color and I enjoy the attention to detail that fills this book.Kristin Joy Pratt-Serafini has a talent in writing books that are fun and informative. This book details the changing of the seasons (month to month) in the desert environment as seen by a young girl and her friend.
__label__2,"Steven Fierstien: Enya is the best vocal artist of all time. Her somgs and the basis for her songs is unique and original, to say the least. If you are concidering purchasing this CD, trust me its good and well worth the money. Now, I'm a pretty good judge of character and anyone who gives Enya less than 5 stars is out of their minds. If you noticed like I did that the people who gave Enya one's are aol users; you must understand that these people are not capable of determining anything good. It's time to drop Fat Boy Slims andcome into a more civilized age...a NEW AGE!!!"
__label__2,"Entertaining, well-written historical murder mystery: The most interesting mysteries are those of a different generation. After Bland Simpson learned this simple lesson, he applied it, turning out an absorbing and true tale of murder, love and damning coincidence taken from the Victorian Age. The story takes place in remote Elizabeth City, N.C., and focuses upon the murder of a beautiful young woman and the possible involvement of her spurned lover. It follows the footsteps of those closest to the story and builds to a climax of uncertainty and mystery."
__label__1,"You get what you pay for...: Read reviews of this item here on ecom and decided to purchase it while at my local Walmart since they had it and it was cheap ($15.88). Well, you get what you pay for; the lid is cheaply constructed and doesn't fit tightly, also the ""travel lid"" which is the actual lid, has a slider to cover up the drinking hole, between both of these the lid leaks like a sieve. Also the blade is molded into the cup so if you take it with you and break it, you are out the cup and blade assembly not to mention you can use the thing if it's in the dishwasher. Overall the unit isn't very powerful, hardly creates a vortex when half full of plain water. Also in the instructions it says not to use with hot liquids or hard foods such as crackers, nuts, etc. This is going to be going back to Walmart in favor of the Tribest Mason Jar Personal Blender and Grinder here on ecom. I only gave it two stars because it is cheap but you get what you pay for..."

__label__2,"Wonderful!: I am 6 mos pregnant and the back aches have been killing me at work. So since I walk around all day at work an electric heat ing pad was out of the question, i can't be tethered to the wall! I ordered this item and it is GOD-SENT. I love how quick it heats up in the microwave and I just snap it on and off I go! It smells great and it's easy to cover in front of customers with a jacket! The print is cute and I am definitely going to order some more as gifts. Evey one needs one of these!"
__label__2,"tough and versatile: Safety glasses that are good looking enough to wear anywhere. I have been slipping them on ,not only when doing mowing and trimming , but also around the pool and for quick trip to the store and so forth. I like them because they have the UV protection but they are not so dark as to affect visibility.They are comfortable to wear and seem to be designed for a fairly large head. My only problem with them is that they sometimes slip and hang down when I am looking down while trimming."

__label__2,"Good, but dated....: I have used this textbook for several years - while it is a good basic source of information, it badly needs updating and supplementation in several important areas: RFID is not mentioned; Mobile/hand set E-Commerce is covered at a surface level, Search Engine and major Portal marketing needs updating, and much of the data are 3+ years old - very old given the rapid changes taking place.If you are teaching an E-Commerce course from a Marketing perspective, with this book as the base, be prepared to suppement this textbook with books such as Spychips, and student subscriptions to WSJ or NY Times. Ad Age is another excellent supplementary information source.This is one of the few areas in business where the textbook should be updated every 2 years.Note from Spring 07 - the newer edition is better but still requires supplementation on areas auch as RFID and security."
__label__1,"crappy: I bought this cd because everybody is always talking about how cool this band is. I disagree. Every song on this album sound the exact same, and I didn't like it the first time. I don't know about their later albums, but this one sucked big time."
__label__1,"THIS IS NOT A TRIBUTE BUT AN EMBARASSMENT: Why on earth did they have to make a tribute like this to New Order? This is a mess! This is the poorest rendition of classic New Order songs. They made a terrible mess of Blue Monday and The Beach. The guys who did this tribute obliterated the theme and the groove of the music that made New Order the standard by which every modern techno music writers must aspire to be. The guys who did this tribute were definitely not from that generation. Too bad guys, maybe in the next life you might find yourself in the right generation when the sound was New Order and nothing else compared to it. Maybe then you'll realize what the sound of New Order is really all about. I'm giving it one star cuz it came in Cd format. That's about it. Dont buy this CD!"
__label__1,"Not Great Print Quality: A great film if you are into 1930s British horror, but unfortunately the print quality here is not so good. The version released by Arcanum in their Johnny Legend Deadly Doubles series has a much better quality print, PLUS a missing scene. AND it is paired with second feature FACE AT THE WINDOW."
__label__2,"Absolutely brilliant: I will keep my review small, but I will express how brilliant I felt this movie is. I was so intrigued I couldn't miss a single second of this film. Kate Winslet was breathtaking at her role, I can see where some people may find this movie offensive on the account of the older woman and the younger man, but once again this film was just a masterpiece."

__label__2,"It really does wok!: I recently wired my basement for a projection TV, full sound system, etc but screwed up and did not run a wire for my TiVo output upstairs to the basement. Getting another TiVo wasn't as much money issue as having all the shows, etc at one source. I bought the Leapfrog in the hope that I would not have to cut through drywall.Bottom line: it works great! Set up was something like ten minutes. I initially had interference from my 2.4 GHz phone, which I was replacing anyway with a new 5.8 GHz system (Uniden- works great too). When I did that, I get the same image quality downstairs as upstairs (component video isn't great, but workable for TV). The IR relay works well, though I hear a quick buzz through the audio (low, but noticable) when any TiVo remote button is pressed. I get no interference with my 2.4 Ghz D-Link wireless network.This product saved me a tons of time, and will pay for itself in a few months."

__label__1,"Does not work with HP PSC 1350: I purchased this product because it claimed to support the HP PSC 1350. But after going through the setup and reading the support forums, it actually DOES NOT support the HP PSC 1350 printer. I read the netgear support forums with amusement about all the angry customers and the horrible service. Its rediculous. This makes me wonder which printers this product actually works with since it claims to support printers which it does not actually support.I've been burned by netgear products in the past, and this one finally pushed me over the edge. I will never buy another Netgear product again, and will look to Linksys or Belkin for my future networking needs."

__label__2,"Satisfied: I had purchased this for my girlfriend. Our first real test was when we took it with us on a trip to Phoenix. We only experienced one instance when it took us to the completely wrong address. We punched in an In N Out and it took us to a residential house, one built at least 20 years ago.Other than that, it worked great. We brought a couple of maps, but never needed to bring them out. The screen is a bit small although I had no problems reading the text. On some turns, especially when traveling at speeds greater than 45 mph, it tells you to turn right a bit late. We could still make the turns, but with some extra caution to keep fore safe driving.This was a great buy for the money."

__label__1,"Why?: Quite simply, I can't believe that Enya would let the integrity of her original, highly orchestral classics be ""interpreted"" by anyone, much less another orchestra. It's pointless, ridiculous, and the quality is light years removed from Enya's work. I hate to think that her ego is so enormous that she thinks her work could and SHOULD be vandalized. This is like a parody of Enya...not a tribute. Enya is a tribute unto herself for heaven sakes...that's the whole point of her music. This album is MUZAKKKKKK to the Nth Degree!What a thoroughly unoriginal cash-in on another artist's hard work. Maybe one of Enya's poorer relatives in in Taliesin orchestra, and that's why this atrocity was created."

Since, however, it is the seventh book I have a lot of trouble with the two main characters not showing up till the last 50 pages. He spent to the whole book developing two in my opinion un-likabale(word??) characters without weaving the ones we like into until the very end.While Jordan rambles at least he keeps the story somewhat focused around alot of the orginal characters to introduce new ones at this point and focus the whole book on them seems flawed at best."

I recently was clearing up junk from my apartment and came across it. I sat down to read the book to refresh my memory. I couldn't believe how awful this book was.While Righteous Mother made a couple of good points, it couldn't make up the overall failure of this book. It was laced with such racist untrue stereotypes about black and white men, that I was flabbergasted by her ignorance. Some theories she laid out she couldn't even defend with a coherent argument. I wonder if she wrote this book as a joke because some the advice was just too silly. If you follow this book to the letter as a guide to your relationships w/ black men, be forewarned, you're in trouble."
__label__2,$25...WIN!!!: I got this for $25 at a yard sale. There is no way i can complain. This lens rocks. Even if I paid full price i would still be happy. The quality is great and its fast. This lens is nice if you have an EFS body.
__label__2,Amazing: The colors in this is amazing the story it self is very exciting yet tragic the story of how Batgirl became Oracle.
__label__2,"Great toy: Bought this for my great niece who is only a few months old. So while a lot of play is not being had for it, it is a neat cuddle toy!"
__label__1,"Disgusting.: This is the first time I have ever reviewed a book on ecom, but this book was SO incredibly awful that I just had to get my two cents in. I will admit the beginning is great. It grabs you and sucks you right in. The beginning, though, is as good as it is going to get. This book is disgusting and sleazy. The foul language is rampant and completely unnecessary. PLEASE do not waste your money on this book. My copy is in the trash, because that is exactly what this book is... a piece of trash. If I could give it a negative rating, I would."
__label__2,poolhall junkies: My son (age 18)asked for this movie for Christmas. It was a good movie with morales and the teenagers like it; I liked it as well.
__label__1,"The worst book I have ever read: I was amazed at how bad this book was. It is about a kid who steels some famous guys shoes and has to go to boot camp and dig holes. That's 100 or so pages of him and some other criminals digging holes. There is also a secondary story about his grandfather stealing a pig. What I don't understand is how anyone could possibly like this book. I'm assuming the holes have some symbolic meaning, but I can't understand what it could be. I guess ther're emotional holes... Anyway, this is the worst book I have ever read and I suggest that if you must read it, take it out from the library. It's not worth your money!"
__label__1,What the Heck: Really? What a waste of good money. It was recommended by my book club. In my humble opinion it is demeaning to women.
__label__1,not worth the time: This was a big disappointment--the author failed to develop what could have been a great premise. The characters were one-dimensional and I really didn't like any of them. There were also glaring historical errors that I couldn't ignore.
__label__2,"rivalry between two scientists: Edward Marriott's book is an interesting, well-written, anecdoctal account of two rival scientists studying the plague that struck Hong Kong in 1894. In the light of present day news stories of mad-cow disease, SARS, and other exotic ailments that possibly could pose a pandemic threat, Marriott's book is especially relevant.Marriott brings the rat-infested harbor area and the exceedingly crowded, poor districts of the cityto vivid life. The stark pictures of those soon-emptied areas, so quickly deserted by panicked residents, are chilling to view.Recommended to all readers, and especially to those involved in public health issues."
__label__2,"The album is like a delightful visit with well-loved friends: I played many of these timeless piano classics as a child, and as an adult, and found Julia Vieland's performances to be completely satisfying."
__label__2,"King Pinch - Review: King Pinch is definatly one of the greatest FR books ever. It has never ending action, a whole lot of surprises, and much more. This is a great book to read. The action is so great that you never want to put the book down. Definatly one of the greatest books ever!"
__label__2,"Great Battery !!: I bought this battery to enable me to travel several hours and use my pda for file review, music writing, book listening, and music listening. I bought two of these batteries. I just made a trip down to Brazil. One battery easily lasted all the way down on the 11 hour flight and the other battery easily got me home with battery to spare. Great product!"
__label__2,"Great 'Mobile Desktop'!: To bad Sony doesn't make available the 'Sony VAIO GRV670',really nice machine,was made to compete with the regular 'Desktop'. The 'GRV670' is like a 'German Panzer Tank',just rolls right through any 3-D game like 'Shogun: Total War' and 'Medieval: Total War'. Was thinking about a 'Dell' or 'Gateway',but heard the negative reviews,and stuck to 'Sony',fan is quiet,and at worst just gets warm,where as other 'laptops' get hot like a skillet,fry bacon and eggs. Have loaded both 'Shogun: Total War' and 'Medieval: Total War' games on 'Sony VAIO GRV670',works like a charm. I got this 'Sony Vaio GRV670' to do one thing,play 'shogun' and 'medieval',it performs 101%,no crashing,no freeze-ups,no problems period. I'm happy,and completely satisfied,thank you 'Sony'........"
__label__2,Renthead!: This blu ray is amazing! I am such a Renthead and was so looking forward for this to come out! It's so nice to have a dvd of the stage show!
__label__2,enjoyable mystery: After reading the four books in the Frank Pavlicek Mystery series I found that each book was better than the last. At some points I would think I had solved the crime only to discover that I was wrong. The characters are likeable and after reading four books I have began to think of them as friends. I will patiently wait for the next book in this series and will have no problem paying for it. I am glad I decide to spend the money on this series.
__label__2,"Leather Portfolio: I have been very happy with this product. It holds files well and other items, too. It should hold up and last a long time."
__label__2,"What a Find!: I thoroughly enjoyed Love Under Foot. As a man who loves men's feet, such a collection of erotic foot fiction focused on the male foot was a true treasure to find! Such books are worth their weight in gold! There is something here for every man who enjoys other men's feet and footwear, no matter what your taste in men might be. Well-written and varied, these stories fulfill a true need for folks who venture into different erotic experiences."
__label__1,First impression of Philip Glass' music: This is my second Philip Glass album. I honestly tried to stick with it. It's like listening to a washing machine hoping that the dryer will contribute something interesting.
__label__1,"I read the instructions but still it does not work: Tried to get it to work with mac os x, but intermittent results. seems to drop the connection a lot. belkin tech support was of no help. Google this product for more information on mac compatibility.Tried on my wife's windows xp box, and same poor result. Back it goes."
__label__2,Run large but when you get the size right it feels great: I usually wear a size 13 so I ordered these shoes in that size but they were sooo huge but then I got a size 11-1/2 and they fit me perfectly. Really happy about this purchase!
__label__1,"Pass on this one: i really don't understand who makes the decisions to put which albums on cd. i really like bits and pieces of the sons material. lossen up naturally has a few great songs, most of welcome to the dance is awesome and a circle filled with love (only available on vinyl to my knowledge) is super, but i didn't find a single keeper on this cd."
__label__2,"Not just for kids!: The other day, I bought two CDs for my 1 year old. The first was by the Wiggles. The second one was this CD (Folk Playground). Thank goodness I bought the second one. Now I can play accessible and fun music for my daughter and stay sane at the same time! The lyrics are playful and witty, with some artists adding some twists to some old favorites (Victor Johnson - ""This Old Man"", Laurie Berkner - ""Froggie Went a-Courtin'""). The music is mature, pleasant, and of course, folksy. The Zoe Lewis tune, ""Sheep"" is worthy of special mention...a pure delight. But there's not a single clunker on this CD...for the kids or the parents. Are there any more like this out there?"
__label__1,"Mulholland Drive: I thought it would bo difficult to find a worse movie than ""Crash"" and ""Natural Born Killer"". Yes, I found that ""Mulholland Drive"" is comparably bad.I cannot believe that I just wasted my time and my money to be confused by a movie such as this (I have my husband to confuse me already!). I truly believe that the movie stars who gave great review for this movie were just being so sarcastic and full of revenge. They wanted as many people as possible to suffer the way they did."

__label__1,"pro dj: I took this mic on one job and promptly returned it the next day (not purchased on ecom). Basically it did not sound good and had way too much feedback. It may be alright for some light use, but if you are a true professional this product is not for you. I could tell from the moment I opened the box, neither the mic nor the receiver had any weight to them. You can tell it is a cheapy. On the tough and lonely road, it will not be there for you, it will not be your friend. GO STEELERS!!"
__label__2,"Fat City: In ""City,"" a return to form for Huston, the director presents a spare, bleak portrait of humanity on the skids in the world of small-town boxing. Not easy or pleasant to watch, the film's impact sneaks up on you, as Huston's spot-on evocation of this down-and-out world eventually creeps under your skin. The acting bar is set high, with Keach believably tragic in the central role, and Tyrrell stealing the picture (and nabbing an Oscar nod) as the bitter, broken down Oma. Though by Hollywood standards a ""small picture,"" ""Fat City"" still scores a knock-out."
__label__1,"Great Album, Weak Reissue: I buy a ton of music - a lot still on CD - and I am a big fan of the deluxe remastered and repackaged format. Unfortunately this is one of the weakest I've encountered. The remaster of the album itself is solid and sounds great. The liner notes are weak; they seem almost incomplete and include lyrics for only some songs (not Sundown, Slowdown). The jewel pack has a Deluxe band around it and I think it's a cheesy sticker! Feels bootleg. And the extras are some on the weakest I've encountered. Alternate versions of two of the weaker songs and an interview??? In retrospect the single remastered original disc would have been fine. Really a missed opportunity as this was a strange and exciting time in Winwood's career."
__label__1,"Patti's Gospel. . .Go live, Miss Patti. . .go live!!!: After reading what Patti has said in concert about not judging her, I respectfully withdraw my original comments about the album. As usual, Patti's big heart. . .and big mouth, win me over, no matter how much I might find lacking in her recordings. I strongly believe she should do a live gospel ablum/CD compilation a la ""Going Home to Gospel."""
__label__1,"Motor quit after 14 months: The motor died after around 14 months. Wine Enthusiast would not replace, as it was past the 12-month warranty. I searched a few online sites, and have seen several reviews with the same problem. I would not recommend this wine cooler, though it is small and practical, it is cheaply made."
__label__1,Nothing new here: I unfortunately didn't see the other ecom review before buying this DVD. My son was so disappointed - it has no new episodes.
__label__1,orchestra: This album is too sugary. It is not authentic. It is like the orchestra repressed his soul and truth meaning of the songs.
__label__1,"simple and fun but a bit boring: If 2 1/2 stars was an option that would be my rating. I'm a World War 2 buff so I enjoyed the realism and historical basis of this game but overall it's just a basic, decent game to get your shooter fix. It's an older game yet I was still impressed with the graphics and gameplay. My main complaint is that it gets boring. It lacks variety and it didn't grab my interest enough to make me want to play it for very long stretches of time. I was rarely itching to play it the way I've been with other shooters. Of course part of the problem is that I'm used to playing such greats as Bioshock, Halo 3, Gears of War, and COD4. Call of Duty 2 certainly isn't as good as COD4 but I only paid $10 for a brand new copy of this game and at that price or less it's probably worth the money."
__label__1,"I wish there was a -5 stars for any epson printer: I am never buying an Epson again! I have had an Epson printer from the first time I bought one, the last one I purshased was like 7 years ago and finally I could not find ink cartridges so I went to buy a new one thinking that since the last one was great I should have no problems, think again! they claim a rebate buy they give you a debit card that if you don't use quick it drains the funds immediatelly! The ink costs just as much as the printer and they go fast very small and then 15 days after the warranty expired...the damn thing broke, besides their costumer service is awful, they don't have a free 1800 number and they take forever to tell you that there is nothing they can do so you have to take it to their repair service.....trust me, do not buy an epson...buy other brands instead, this company is going down"
__label__2,"Wish I had this earlier: Where has this case been all my life? This is a great phone case for my Palm Treo. I really like the protection AND the added storage for memory or ID. I like the multidapt, too, and plan to order other devices, (ie.handle bar) So I can stow my phone on my motorcycle. Love it."
__label__2,"A Homeschool Classic...should be read by everyone: Ruth Beechick is a comforting voice of confidence to new homeschoolers and math-phobics. She made me feel equipped and prepared to introduce math skills to my children. This book is worth every penny and more for the fun ideas, using basic household items, and the wise counsel. You would have to dig through volumes to get this kind of quality information, otherwise."
__label__1,"Great Music. The Vocals? Not So Much.: Terrific instrumental performances featuring a well-chosen selection of early jazz and blues tunes from Memphis, the band's hometown. The musical arrangements are also wonderful. The problem? The vocals are terrible.For the most part, the singing is crude and without charm. It undercuts everything the band achieves musically. A competent vocalist would have saved this project, but as is, this is largely unlistenable. It's too bad, because I can tell these guys love this music."
__label__2,the hook......: before i knew who no doubt was i was a mess. but one day i picked up return of saturn and i was hooked. no doubt changed my life for the best is to many ways to count. if you dont have even one of the five no doubt albums get one and i promise you. you wont be disapointed.
__label__2,"Was Expecting Splatter...: ...but instead got a good dose of variety. This book contains some very strong psycological horror pieces, as well as some orignial oddball tales and even a Cthulhu-ish ditty. ""Pizza Paradiso"" and ""Pit Crew"" were probably my 2 personal faves. Great read, especially at the cover price. The editing is flawless.For a more extensive review, see Insidious Reflections issue 5, out in January '06."
__label__2,"A New England grouse hunting classic: This is a very well-written book with abundant good humor and dry wit. It is one of the classics of grouse hunting literature. It is not a natural history or a how-to book, but is literature written in a very accessible style about one man's adventures while hunting grouse over a period of many years near his New England home.I am 44 years old. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and so did my 80-year old Uncle who had hunted ruffed grouse for many years in the woods of northeastern Pennsylvania."
__label__2,Can't beat price!: Why would you spend $50 for an Apple dock when you can have this? Beautiful picture and sound - very easy to use. The change left in your car is enough to buy this one.
__label__1,"""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever""!!!!: I really like watching the 15-mins Spongebob Squarepants episodes on TV; they're very innocent and happy, but when I watched this movie I almost lost my head because of the awful it was! This is actually ""the longest and most boring Spongebob episode ever"", the critics here in Chile said that and I totally agree with them.The worst thing the producers could do was to include real people and stupid effects that make you laugh in the movie. Like David Hasselhoff, the made fun of himself by acting here!!!! plus, the stupid effect when he starts acting as if he was a boat or something, I had self-shame when I watched that part!!!!!I think that the worst thing you could do is to buy this DVD: you'll watch it once, you'll hate it and you'll waste 18 bucks. Bad purchase."
__label__1,"Tops: This picture is misleading,I thought I was buying jars,but I only got the tops. What can I say. No wonder it was so inexpensive hahahaa"
__label__2,warm childhood memories: I loved this book as a child! So happy to find a copy here to add back to my book collection.Thanks ecom seller!
__label__2,"Top Working Dogs: Found the font size small, not that easy to read. However, the content is superb, if there is an updated version (training methods etc. change)I would be first in line.It is so good to get a book from a pro, someone who's been there, done that, got the T shirt at the very highest level."
__label__2,UNbeleivable: when i first got this gun i was concerned because i have never owned a sniper for airsoft only a g36c which had been a favorite till this gun came. it was off but just a little tweak of the hop up and i couldnt beleive my eyes. the bb's were flying straight and accurate very highly recommended. A good side arm to go with this is a tsd m9 co2 non-blowback baretta.
__label__1,"I received an empty can.: When I opened up my package I thought the can was oddly light but I didn't think too much on it. Then I followed the directions and tore off the locking tab on top of the can, held it upright, and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. No air came out regardless of how firmly I held the trigger. Eventually I came to the conclusion that the ""10 oz"" can contained nothing whatsoever."
__label__2,Best Creature Yet: This set not only saves you ten dollars but also gives you an awsome new promo mask wich makes the deal even sweeter.You get three sets which combine to make ultimate dume.I give this toy a thumbs up way up!
__label__1,It was lousy: ok lil romeo was a fase for me but he is okay and its not the fact that i dont like him anymore that brings the album down even when i liked him i thought it was a bummer.The songs on the album mostly are about his old friends and his life it was enjoyable the first 2 or 3 times actually listening to the words but music and beat wise was poor.I dont even listen to it anymore.Its not awful but by far not great.But he is 11 and writes his own music i respect that!
__label__1,"a disappointingly un-original remake: I have to disagree with brir@erols.com on this one. Having listened to -- and loved -- NOW's previous CD ""Smoker's Delight"", all I can say is they must've been too delighted with the smoke to create a new album this time around. Rather than expanding on the brilliantly mellow direction of the previous release, it seems like the guys in the band were in creative suspended animation for the intervening years: The whole thing is literally variations on the tracks from ""...Delight"" -- and not even interesting variations! At the very least Warp could've promoted this as variations on previous material rather than passing it off as an original release...I guess it sounds really good if you don't know that they're stealing their own work. Buy the 5-star ""Smoker's Delight"" disc instead!"
__label__2,"Absolutely Painless!: I recently started school in preparation for a career change. It's been 35 years since I've done this type of math. To say I was rusty is a massive understatement. However, with the aid of this book, I was back up to speed in no time.If you're looking to refresh some old skills or just beginning to learn it for the first time, this book will definitely give you the edge you need to get into algebra quickly while making it fun rather than a chore.Highly recommended."
__label__1,"Good music,but grow up Glen: I've never been a fan of Deicide explicit,god bashing lyrics,but there music is top notch.Glen who is now probably 36 or so i'm assuming,really needs to grow up and stop blaming god for all his trouble's and start blaming himself.I myself am not a strong believer in a god at all but at least i don't go around criticising,and cursing him all the time.Yes i'm angered that IF there is a god he hasn't done anything to stop world problems but hey thats life.Anyhow this is pretty much the same trash as always,although the music does rock.And no i didnt by this crap,i downloaded it..then got rid of it:)"
__label__1,"Not for coffee lovers: This little contraption is a waste of money for folks that prefer a medium to strong coffee. I've even retro-fitted mine like others suggest and it still did not eliminate the water down taste...ACK! If you're wanting to try it out yourself, buy it from a store that you're able to return to, because the chances are you will."
__label__2,"Tough reading: Although Frank's writing is readable, it is not easy reading for the general reader. Walter Isaacson's Einstein bio is an easier reading, which I suggest, UNLESS one is into Physics...flyingears"
__label__2,Worked very good: Works great. . . Had no problem with ick transferring fish to new tank. A must have for new tank of fish.
__label__2,"The man who went up in smoke: Highly readable, well thought out plot, Beck his usual glum self. I always enjoy reading the Beck stories he is so very Swedish."
__label__1,"Waste of money, bad DVD: This Jay Jay dvd is fully different from PBS Kids episodes of Jay Jay the Jet Plane. Many episodes have a new character that speaks Spanish all the time. This DVD is great if you speak and understand Spanish. Otherwise, it is a waste of money. I would rather record from my PBS."
__label__1,lacy15: Very difficult to read and follow events. The author is well versed and has factual material but not broken into pieces so it's manageable.
__label__1,"Not impressed: For all of the great reviews, I was expecting an extreme workout. I was disappointed in this DVD. There were some new moves, but just an ok workout overall."
__label__2,"The Beatles one of there Adventures with Great Music.: I had to get this for my Son , he now loves the Beatles like I do. I have been getting him all the Beatles music , movies , and he has picked up on there music from me ."
__label__1,"Poor choice, heels are lousy: Initially I was happy with these shoes. But, the heels quickly began to wear. The heel consists of a block of wood, with a thin, thin layer of rubber over it. Once the rubber begins to wear where the heel strikes (which happened for me in the first four months), the wood make the shoes very loud to walk in. And the more it wears, the worse the problem becomes. People in the office joked that they knew who was coming - namely me - because the sound was unmistakable. I won't be buying another pair of these."
__label__2,"Learning can be fun!: I purchased this for my 4 year old when she started telling me she wanted to learn how to ""tie shoes like a big girl"". She was excited to start as soon as we received the book, and continues to practice. The poem inside is cute and the laces easy to work."
__label__1,Crummy re-recordings: These aren't the recordings you remember and they just doesn't have the punch. Very weak.
__label__2,"A nice easy read containing practical tips to boost your career: A good book with some very practical advise on how to succeed as a manager,but also how to deal with issues in everyday life. I think the managerial aspect of this book means it is more for those who already find themselves in lower management and want to move up the corporate ladder.I appreciated the insight into life of the Author and the tips, quotes and ""remember this"" at the end of each chapter are well worth making note of.Time will tell if it will get me a promotion ;-)"
__label__1,"Pointless: A friend recommended thsi movie to me, promising a lot of laughs. I found it juvenile and pointless."
__label__1,"unreliable ,prone to failure: Comcast installed this modem at my house. Two months later, it failed. The technician installed a new one, DOA. So third one is an Arris cablemodem and it works( so far.) Comcast has already committed to use Arris equipment for super highspeed , RCA equipments must have been performed poorly as a whole."
__label__1,"Tries to take on too much: This title seems to be on every CMM person's shelf, based on title alone. However, covering up to level 5 in one book means that it is not a practical reference for a journey to any particular level. It seems to gloss over just about every topic, and fails to provide the level of detail to really be a useful guide. I have stopped using it at all as a reference."
__label__1,workbook: This appears to be a workbook for a class?? Not made entirely clear through the explanation. I subsequently returned it.
__label__1,"Waste of money: I have a significant S-curve and have been doing Iyengar yoga for about a year. I was looking to learn poses particularly beneficial for pain relief or tips to adjust the regular poses for my condition that instructors may not know about. However, very little in this DVD is scoliosis-specific, it is basically an introduction to Iyengar yoga - how to stand, breathe, and do very basic poses. Anyone can learn all that by going to one yoga class, where you also have the benefit of an instructor's presence. The only useful thing I learned from this video was rotating the position of my hand in downward dog in a way to pull in my mid-back curve. Not really worth 30 dollars, in my opinion. The author claims to have reduced her curve through yoga, but even if that's true, clearly it was not done via such elementary sequences. Would only recommend it for absolute beginners who don't have Iyengar yoga in their city."
__label__2,"I will keep this forever!: A must-have for Sex and the City lovers. It includes Bonus Discs and pages after pages of pictures and tidbits, not-to-mention the pink and fuzzy cover... what more could one ask for?"

__label__1,"The grace and beauty of the original book has been lost...: Most of the book has been changed. And not for the better. It has taken on a totally different perspective and lacks in most areas. Listening to this for the first time made me laugh in disgust. They went as far as changing the ending. While reading the book, I cried as I finished. By the time I finished the tape, I tossed it in the trash where it belonged."
__label__1,"Could not crack pecans.: On the first attempt to crack pecans, pistons shifted and handle bent. Cracker is not designed for tough chores. Wish I didn't spend the money. My Channellocks pliers works just a good. Need to send back and tell them to keep it."
__label__2,"Alias ROCKS!!!: If you're an Alias fan you NEED this collection! We already know the show is great, but the presentation here is just AWESOME!!! The Rambaldi artifact box is way cool. The lid lifts off and then the sides (which are held in place with magnets) fall out. Each season of disks are held in individual little books. The best part was the false bottom that I didn't even know about when I purchased the collection!! What a fun surprise! There's an 'extras' disk underneath the books when you lift out the false bottom that has interviews from back when they shot the pilot, footage from the last episode and SO MUCH MORE. So glad I waited to buy until I could get all 5 seasons together like this! You won't be disappointed with this purchase!"

__label__2,"Great collaboration: Saw Clapton interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning on 11/08. Clapton told the interviewer that, as much as he regrets to admit, he just can't do some of those things he used to be able to do on the guitar. More and more, Clapton is truly becoming ""Slowhand."" For the past several of his albums, that really bothered me. He seemed not only to be slowing down (hey, the man's in his sixties) but he also seemed to be writing songs just to fill up space. But, here, on this CD with his friend J. J. Cale as his musical mentor, Clapton's guitar work is stellar. Here, the ""Slowhand"" appelation is certainly appropriate, but there's a feeling here that Clapton has also found a new interest in his own playing. The songs are mostly Cale's and they're great stuff, but what's nice is how fresh and energized and interested Clapton sounds. By the way, have you seen the DVD of Clapton's Crossroad's Guitar Festival; it'll blow you away."
__label__1,Not worth it.: loses shape quickly making them unstackable. I machine washed and dried them as directed and they will not go back to cubed shaped. My son (7 mo. old) has no interest as well.
__label__1,Can I give it NO stars instead?: There is nothing organic about this product.It is full of PEG which is polyethyleneglycol aka the antifreeze in your car. The list does go on.Don't be fooled by the name. Just take a look at the ingredients list and stand in amazement that these people aren't coughing up thousands of dollars in fines for selling a product labeled as organic when it clearly is not organic at all. It is people like this that are killing people everyday by poisoning people for a profit.
__label__1,"Not like the original: I'm not sure that the ""5-star reviewers"" actually ordered this item. When compared to the original filter which came with the unit, it is MUCH thinner and flimsy. Also, there is NO way to get two filters out of this. It is too small. after cutting out one, there is less than 1/2 of the sized needed to make another. Do yourself a favor and order an original carbon pre-filter. I'm tossing this one and looking for the reall thing."
__label__2,Great looking bonsai but had a few wire marks!: Great tree! Really thick trunk! And very fast shipping!!! But the tree did have a few wire marks! One was really bad.. I also found a piece of wire in one of the branches I had to pull out.. But other then the wire marks it is a really good tree!! Big and healthy...
__label__1,"Someone get Quentin a Dialogue Editor!!: ZZZZZZZZ... Part 1 was good, but someone needs to do an intervention with Quentin. Not every word that he produces on the page is gold. Some of it is out and out awful. Examples: Huge chunks of David Carradine's speeches at the end, and Darryl Hannah's snake/notebook crap. A good editor could have made this movie at least a half hour shorter. Even the most indulgent Italian westerns weren't paced as glacially as this mess.A few good action scenes, but little else to recommend for two and a half hours of your time."
__label__1,"Gets the job done, but swivels in the guitar: Title says it. It amplifies the sound, but swivels down once plugged into the guitar. There's no real way to make it point forward unless you prop it against a table or something."

I tried the native driver intall as posted, but I still experienced numerous freezes and crashes on my iBook. I also heard buzzing whenever the hard drive was reading or writing data. Oh, and playing audio seemed to really tax the CPU, to the point where the iBook was practically unuseable for anything else.I switched to an Airport Express and couldn't be happier. No problems with sound quality, no freezes or crashes, and there's no noticeable load on the CPU."

It is a bit smaller than I expected. Product measurements include the seams. You need to blow it up, but it has held air well. I love it and would purchase it again."
__label__1,"nice idea but doesn't work - save your time and your money: I bought this to use in teaching at the university. I installed the software and found that the device didn't work. I called technical service at Seiko but apparently this item was discontinued several years ago. A nice gentleman attempted to help me but it was clear that he had never seen or setup or used the device. I was on the line with him quite a while and apparently his supervisor felt enough was enough so I was told to try something and call back if I had problems. I was disgusted with Seiko and contacted my seller and requested a refund. He was very nice about it, credited me that day, and didn't even want the device back.Bottom-line: don't waste your money - Seiko gave up on it ages ago and they don't support it."

__label__1,"Bad Movie All Together: Undoubtedly, this is the worst Star Wars movie of the four. It is pointless, silly and pretty much stupid. The plot is somewhat confusing and the characters speak English with such an accent, nobody understands them. Jar Jar was another bad idea. What moron at Lucasfilm's thought of him? He was completely designed for kids yet many fans are kids AS WELL AS Adults. Jar Jar had absolutely no point in the movie. He could have easily been drafted out of it. This movie all together was a bust. The only reason it wasn't a flop was because it carried the prestigious name STAR WARS. If George Lucas had brought this script to Fox Studios 22 years ago, they would have rejected him along with every other movie company in the world."

AAA x 3 fyi.I bought one for little girl and one for my girly nieces. I will not put this item near children because of course it is clearly an aerosol dispenser.

With a few exceptions--""White Zombie,"" ""Murder by Television""--these films are totally unknown. Until now.Every movie in here was put out by the lesser-known studios--Monogram,Mascot,Chesterfield,ect. The book covers a wide range of sub-genres, from jungle exploitation films to action serials to sinister westerns, so long as there are vague horror elements.The authors have done a great service, and their writing style is very eloquent. By all means purchase this and seek out some of these films."

You need to angle it in bright sunshine, or push the light button to read it. Also, the Minute hand completely blocks the display when it is anywhere near the 6:00 o'clock position. Also, the hour hand is a different color which was hard to get used to. I had to return it, because I could not read the display."

When the set arrived and attempted to play -- the tapes would NOT track properly; skipped through tracks; sound track would be garbled or not play at all. I contacted the vendor and relayed the problems I was experiencing. The vendor stated he had bought the set from a ""GOODWILL Industries "" outlet. Sorry 'bout that!!!I located the original producer of the series and he was willing to transfer the Master Tapes onto DVDs. And included all the original inserts.Cost me approximately $65, but worth every cent."

Still this also has a lot of good tips and recipes, and a lot of information if you are just starting. Juicing is a wonderful way to get healthy and improve your life."
__label__2,"YES! YES! YES!: Well,here is a Bruckner Ninth to reckon with! I fully agree that the first three movements have the kindof ferocious intensity that Furtwaengler brought to the score, and the addition of the reconstructed Finale makes this indepensible. This movement is truly the crown of his symphonic finales, and Eichhorn makes it sound glorious. Among modern Ninths, I still love the Tintner on Naxos, but the Eichhorn is even more a MUST. Avoid the Wildner performance on Naxos, it is very lax and sounds like the conductor is basically unsympathetic to the music."

First off, these sneakers do not have any official Reebok logos. No tag on the tongue, no insignia on the side. There are phony imprinted stickers that say Reebok. The size was not even close. This must be the smallest 11.5 in the world. Never had a problem with any 11.5 from any manufacturer. The material is cheap and the product is not worth anything at all. STAY AWAY!"

__label__2,"Homage to the 30's screwball comedy.: Don't listen to the ecom.com review of this movie.I don't own this movie but I'm watching it on cable right now and just came here to purchase.If you know anything about the old screwball comedies of the 30's where manic paced things happen all at once within one household for the whole picture, you will see this is a well done homage to that genre.Surprisingly, this is one of Chevy Chase's funniest movies since he stopped doing drugs."
__label__2,Fantastic Video: I loved this video and Michael seems to be so at home in front of a band. It was great to see him with Rosemary Clooney and the Duke Ellington band headed by Mercer Ellington. He should do more videos like this one!
__label__2,"Great Camera, Great Price: This is an excellent 2 megapixel digital camera. I have had it for a few days, and I am very impressed with it. The quality is excellent; I can print large pictures without having them pixelated. After the picture is taken, you can pan and zoom into different parts of the picture, directly from the camera. The included software makes saving and printing your pictures simpler than ever. It is very easy to adjust the flash settings in different lighting conditions; the camera can do this, but I like to adjust the settings to make the picture the way I like it. The camera uses XD memory, not to be confused with SD. XD memory is a fairly new technology and is not compatable with most printers that print directly from the card. However, unless you have a printer that prints directly from a memory card this is not a problem. Overall, this is a great camera that I thoroughly enjoy. This would make a perfect gift for the techno-geek or shutter-bug on your Christmas list."

__label__1,"Clancy cures insomnia: Clancy again disappoints his readers. Please - where is the editor? Cut out 40 % and the stuff might eventually become readable. The plot is highly predictable and very thin, the characters are at best two dimensional, with some racism added. Due to its length, this book ought to be a good cure against insomnia. There is too little action, the techno stuff is also quite weak. His politcial asides are hard to stomach. TC's views on social security: Who cares? Probably the age of the techno thriller is over. Anyway: If You want to read thrilling stuff, buy McNab, Bravo 2 0 or Immediate Action."

I would have given negative stars but you can't do that. So for the incompetent people who can't cook or taste anything, this is probably right up your ally."
__label__2,"AN EASY FUN READ: I saw the movie first, then read the book. It is written in an easy to read style, and follows the movie closely. The book wastes no words and has fast paced action, just like the movie. If you liked the movie you should love this novel."
__label__1,"Not very impressed: My 4 year old daughter began asking for this movie as soon as she saw the commercials running the months before Christmas. This was our first 'Buddies' movie ever and though my daughter claims she really likes it, neither he nor my 2 yr old son has asked to watch it in over 2 months. This might be because it's a Christmas movie and it's now February but I think it has more to do with the fact that the movie just isn't very engaging.To me the story line seems like one big generic Christmas themed mess with a really pathetic appearance from Christopher Lloyd (as a mean, Christmas-hating dog catcher who later has a change of heart...of course). It didn't keep my kids' attention at all. There just wasn't any kind of cute 'spark' to it - just mostly a bunch of puppies running around and getting into mischief."
__label__2,"P.S. Longer letter Later, a book review by Mallory: P.S. Longer Letter Later is a great realistic fiction book by Paula Danziger. It is about a girl, Elizabeth, who's best friend, Tara *Starr, moves away, and the only way she can communicate with her is by e-mail. Elizabeth's parents are very strict about what she does, so she is not able to call Tara *Starr. But when Dad loses his job, he starts going crazy! Will her family be able to stay together? Tara * Starr starts making friends, and hardly ever writes her. Elizabeth is having a hard life. A great story of friendship. I like this book because I think it is very well written, and it really gives you an idea of what Elizabeth is going through. This book is perfect for people who like friendship stories. P.S. Longer Letter Later is a great book to read."
__label__2,"Excelent, Spectacular, and Wonderful!!: J.V. Jones is a brilliant writer!! Her marvelous contrivance of both character and plot make her triology an irresistible read indeed. I was lured into her saga by the endearing Jack, loyal Tawl, and headstrong Melliandra. Readers come to know and love them, almost as if they were real. Jones' potency of plot is equally unforgettable; from the truly sinister Baralis and his incessant scheming, to the inward torments of the more benign characters, never is there a dull moment. Her Master and Fool ended the trilology with stark power, and readers are left to impatiently await the arrival of a new, equally abosorbing series. All I can say is BRAVO, Miss Jones, BRAVO!"
__label__2,"Great game, but then what?: Nice control, great graphics, cool premise. But when it's over, it's over. I was kind of disappointed that there wasn't much more beyond the gameplay than punch, kick, fire finger laser, fire special attack. With a limited number of combos thrown in. I loved it that I could kick enemies into each other and that provided some challenge. But ultimately there was something about this game that left me cold. Technically, for graphics and sound and control, it's great. But you have to rate on more than what the numbers show. The more I thought about it though the more I thought that this was more of a Mega Man clone than anything else. Which is great! The Mega Man collection for the GBA was disappointing in that it didn't include the console versions as well (I would have loved to play Mega Man X 1 through 6 on my GBA).---Proper criticism doesn't complain and not explain."

__label__2,I recommend to every new parent: I bought my copy of this book 11 years ago just after the birth of my first child. Two more children later and I still refer to it constantly. Every symptom and concern is covered and the guidelines are easy to follow. I constantly recommend the book to other new parents and give it as a gift often.
__label__2,Fantastic SACD: This was never advertised as a multi-channel SACD and I am glad that they didn't try to reformat it. The definitive edition of Peter Gabriel's work is all on SACD now and are must-haves for any fan with an SACD player. What many people do not realize about SACD is that the sampling rate is 2.8 MILLION samples-per-second as opposed to a normal CD which is only 44.1 THOUSAND sps. It is as close to an analog stream that you can get.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you don't have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high-definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference. But for Audiophiles? A dream come true.
__label__2,Product is fine but postage is too high: I ordered 1 lb of Sorghum flour from Barry Farm Foods. The flour is fine and costs $1.99 but the postage cost was $7.50!

__label__1,"An embarassment.: Firstly, I'll start off by saying that I'm a Jewel fan, insofar as I'm a big fan of her music (both published and not).That out of the way, this book of ""poetry"" is sub college magazine drivel, with Jewel and her navel sharing moments of extreme intimacy, and proceeding to a)bore the reader senseless and b)bore the reader senseless in a very poorly constructed way.Even the title is essentially meaningless (if slightly clever) wordplay, and don't expect the rest of the book to even live up to that.Only buy this if the book is the exact thickness to prop up a specific wobbly table leg in your house. Otherwise you'll find it's useless."

__label__1,7 Meg MAX. SLOW and obsolete.: This was a decent unit when it was new. I used one for years but when Comcast got above 7 meg (now 22) this could not perform above 7. Don't buy if you have more than 7 meg as this will be the weak link in your chain. I upgraded to the FVS318G 4 years ago and that is a big improvement but limited to 22 MEG. Its time for a new upgrade.

Quality is OK at best--color of the robe is a little washed out, fabric thin, and the laces gap a little (easily resolved by wearing a solid shirt underneath), but overall perfectly fine for an under $30 Halloween costume."
__label__2,"Just enjoy: Unfortunately it isn't a book that'll help us understand how to set up and run a business sucessfully. Let alone the book or any media business, all that carry a huge ammount of sheer luck or ""right place at the right time"" in its record of achievements. Mr. Epstein shows the way through a business in which projections and assurance simply don't exist. It is the true business of risk and good sense. It won't show you how to succeed but again no book will. But it will entertain you an awful lot and hopefully make you want to be part in this great and demanding profession."
__label__1,"I loved Acropolis and Tribute, but not this one.: First of all, this is not a flame review from a Yanni hater, I loved, absolutely loved Acropolis and Tribute. The contributions of the live musicians Karen Briggs, Pedro, Armen Anassian, Ming, and all the other fabulous musicians really brought Yanni's compositions to life. On this CD you get the return to the ""old"" Yanni sound, although now he has some fancier drum machines and some fancier ""vocalizing"" computers. It is billed as a departure from his previous projects, and I would say if you enjoyed Tribute and Acropolis you may not like this one. However, if you liked Reflections of Passion, you may like it just fine. Anyone else hear ""repetitions"" of familar Yanni themes on this new CD? I did, and I thought that was a shame, too."
__label__1,"BIG!!!!: This carseat looked so comfortable and when we put our son into it, he seemed to like it and it fit him so well! But when we got it home and tried to install it!!!!!!! This thing is ***HUGE*** We have a Chevy Blazer and an '05 Dodge Ram Quad Cab and this car seat will not fit in either of the trucks! I had to move the passenger seats all the way forward and sitting up straight in order to fit the car seat in. It would not fit in the center because then I would have to move both the driver's seat and the passenger seats up! If you had a mini-van or something that had a large back seat, you probably won't have any problems.It was also a pain to install! I tried to install it in the Blazer, but I couldn't get the seat belt tight(no LATCH) because where I would put my knees in the seat it where the belt has to run under the padding. You may have better luck with the LATCH.I am now looking for a seat that my 20lbs, 27inch tall, 4 month old will be able to use! Good Luck!"

__label__2,"Good variety of American Choral Music: This album features a wonderful selection of ""American"" choral music. I'm not a big fan of the ""stylized"" singing of the shape-note pieces (with the nasal voices), but that is my only complaint. My favorite piece is Steven Stucky's ""Whispers"" which is an artfully crafted homage to Orlando Gibbons' ""Drop, Drop, Slow Tears"" and William Byrd's ""Ave Verum Corpus."" Joseph Jennings and Chanticleer effectively demonstrate that there is no ""defining"" American choral music and it is this rich panoply of variety which is so enchanting!"

Cecil Mulliner's mother was going mad. Since we all know that madness is hereditary, Cecil had to get disengaged from the girl he loved but breaking an engagement is against the Code of the Mulliners. However, there were some quite brilliant chaps at the Drones Club to advise him. The solution was to employ a melodrama queen past her prime(Collins) to break things up. At a Savoy luncheon with his mother and fiance, Collins confronted him: ""You swine!""...He: ""Waiter some wine""... Collins: ""You have treated me shabbily""...He: "" Waiter! Chablis"".

When I checked a few days later, I found out that S&R; thought my destination drive was full after 3 backups.

It lulled me into thinking I was backed-up when I wasn't. I think that borders on irresponsible!I sent an e-mail to ""Support"" and got none. I don't think the support tech knows what a GB is.

The supporting characters were ok, but Jay Hernandez as Carlito was confusing, his role was not defined nor lucid. I understand this was a prequel but even in a prequel you setup the sequel (see Indiana Jones and Star Wars). This did not setup anything, it was more convoluted than one could imagine.I am from Chicago grew up in the inner city, saw thugs, drugs, shootings, the whole nine yards and I have learned not to celebrate any of that culture. For those wannabe gangsters who have turned Tony Montana into the Pope of Crime this will serve them well. For those of us who enjoy great story-telling such as the GodFather, Carlito's Way, Once Upon a Time in America, American Me, A Gathering of Old Men and others like these titles we will not particularly care for this film."

__label__1,"This one is a disapointment.: Remember those great Ernest Tubb hits from the radio and juke boxes, well not many of them made it to this release. Most of these are NOT the ones your used to hearing, I dont know where they came from, maybe they were demos, or an earlier version, but they are not the ones that made him a legend. They sound like they were recorded in garage as well. The only ones that sound like the original to me are ""Thanks Alot, and Sweet Thang""."
__label__1,"These guys really dislike Kerry: One previous reviewer wrote this as, apparently, some kind of praise for the Authors. The makers of Farenheit 9/11 really dislike Dubya, so I guess that would be their positive in that reviewers eyes. Personally, I feel it is the weakness of both works.Like Farenheit, this book was written with the end result already decided. This book is less a research into anyone's ability to command than it is a well researched, footnoted propoganda pamphlet. I came into this book hoping for a balanced arguement over Kerry's abilities, instead I got a basic smear campaign.It is also based on an arguement that seems to lose all of it's steam. Kerry is to be villified for his service in Vietnam, while Dubya is to be held above contempt for his brave service in Texas? Does Dubya have some purple heart from a tumbleweed incident I'm not aware of?"
__label__2,"Great Product: Easy to use, but once in a while it doesn't seperate songs into individual tracts like it's supposed to so I have to do it manually."
__label__1,Haven't even received the magazine yet....: I ordered this subscription in mid December and still have not received my first issue. I would love to say I love the product though!
__label__2,"Good stuff: What can I say? The man delivers. He mixes everything and does it with talent most of the time. Morrisson is good and getting better. He is still far from Moore... but then... everybody is. The Invisibles is one of the best series ever, up there with the Sandman, Cerebus and all the other good stuff!!!"
__label__1,still going to the laundry-mat: The washer is a major pain...it repeatedly stops and refills even though it's perfectly level. I have no ideal how to fix this problem.
__label__1,"Very overrated text: Brealy and Meyers, generally, do a good job in laying out the fundamential concepts of corporate finance. However, wording is unclear, some examples are incomplete or suffer from clarity, and some problems and examples don't explaing how intermediate values used are actually determined. Overall, the book can be confusing and should be taught in conjunction with course teaching. Independent reading can lead to improper understanding."
__label__1,"Waste of time: Listened to the CD on a trip. Found it a total waste of time. The reader (who plays a cop on TV)was a very poor choice for this book. He tried to do all the voices but was not able to and ended up making me laugh at his attempts to do the sophiscated NYC female and young child voice. This book is full of ""big words"" but not much else."
__label__2,A Gift That Keeps Giving: This collection of poetry will keep on giving to anyone interested in the power of poetry to sustain and inspire or in the fragile and humane work of teaching. At first I read it cover to cover. Since I've been called back many times to certain poems or stories. Each poem is accompanied by a short story about what the particular poem has meant to the teacher who submitted it. Sometimes it's hard to tell which is more powerful--the poem or the teacher's story. In this little volume lie the seeds of true school reform! Read it and pass it on.
__label__1,"no title: I found it very slow. covering a time span of 19 years over which nothing much happened, yet the end when it came was absolutely stunning and totally tragic. Not a happy ending at all, at all. And Gurr's way of writing was so irritating, short choppy little sentences that assumed you knew what he was talking about, when in fact more than a few times I hadn't a clue. References to things I did know, and didn't. First purely spy novel I've read since ""A Perfect Spy, by Le Carre, and that really was more of a character study than plot. This guy just talks the talk and I ain't in on it. If you were an ex-spy, or a naval person, then maybe. Gurr is an ex-naval person. This is his first novel and there were more on the shelves. He is now a architect. Go figure. (My husband, to be fair, read it in a few days, liked it, and understood it. He is ex-Air Force.)"

__label__1,"Broke 1st Use!: Bought this for a long car ride with my 2 young boys. Both clips, on both sides broke the first time my husband went to install it. He rigged it with the remaining clips, but the case kept wanting to close shut, and my older son kept complaining he couldn't see. The case was nice, but with the broken clips, it was frustratingly useless."
__label__1,Lame History Channel content not worth the price: Bought this based on the stellar reviews. The 3D is lame. Most of it is scientists standing in front of a post that you can tell is behind them. The animation is weak and several of the clips are replayed repeatedly throughout the show. Good content for children maybe but for the asking price - these should be spectacular.
__label__2,Great Book on Advertising and Media Excellence!: I would highly recommend this book to anyone involved in the broadcast media. Great insights!

__label__2,"Pharrell, Chad make a great team: I loved all the songs they produced and written on this album. I was throw off by the rock songs, but overall it was a great album by two talented people."
__label__1,"I don't like this movie...: The Sting thoroughly bored me and I regret spending the money I did on it. It's a fairly dated movie and is slow-moving. If you see The Sting at Blockbuster Video or something I strongly urge you NOT to rent it. It will more than likely bore you to tears - that is if you even make it half-way through. By God I will never unravel the mystery of how this inferior film won Best Picture award. The best film of '73 was The Exorcist - far and away, and the academy knows it. Thank you for reading."
__label__1,"What a Disappointment: You have got to be kidding. I wasted my time reading this one because this book received such good reviews.Yes, I think Greg Iles is an excellent writer. Twenty-four Hours was really exciting. However, I had to force myself to finish this one. I continued to read it because I thought it might get better.Save your time and money on Dead Sleep. You might just fall into a deep sleep while reading it."

It did so very clearly!Now I use it all the time and don't have to go beg the operations people for their (antique) meter!This phase meter is easy to setup and does not subject you to guessing about what is happening. Nice clear read-out of what's going on.It's constructed well and of good materials. The case is small but everything fits inside.Someone said to me once, ""Buying expensive tools is easy, finding good inexpensive tools is hard."" This tool is one of the ""good inexpensive"" ones!"
__label__2,"Where everyone else learned blues tone.: There are (or were, sadly) a few amazing things about Roy Buchanan: he learned his craft in the American North, and he played a simple Telecaster directly into an amp, no effects. So his blues land somewhere between Motown and the Band, and his tone is all hand made - he holds and stretches notes as an art form, deriving effects from pure string attack and picking tricks. On this CD, the live version of ""Roy's Bluz"" is a masterpiece, showing just how far he could take the unadorned guitar. Everything on the disk is amazing, even the rare Roy vocals, but I would own it just for that 8 min. track."
__label__1,"My Secret Life with a Sex Addict: After I read this book I really disliked Emma Dawson for not protecting her daughters. Especially when one of the daughter was being raped.She has made so many excuses for herself and expect God and Man to forgive her.Well Emma, I do hope you are in a better place today. Frankly I think you are horrible.I do not recommend your book to anyone. It is a waste of time and energy.Anyone who wants to read this book I would recommend that you listen to some good music or see a movie."
__label__2,Copland: This is one of the best NEXT-Gen titles on the xbox 360. The first person point of view is a great way to play like hits such as Halo and Call of Duty 2. Condemned show how one would act in a real fight by using anything not nailed down to hit a zombie with. The Digital camera and tool of the game are great. Some of the zombies are actually jump out at you before you can react. The art work push the power of the 360 above most other games.
__label__2,"This is the best CD that I have ever listened too.: This is so cool, on what other CD can you hear about Booty, and swap meet louie."
__label__1,"Not worth the money: While there were some interesting quotes, this book will leave most fans feeling somehow cheated since the entire book could be read by any child or adult in one sitting. It's definitely not so much a book that was researched and then written as it is a book composed of a bunch of quotes all randomly thrown together. There are much better books out there on racing so save your money and buy one of them."
__label__1,"Experiment in Terror by Schifrin is a Bore!: I keep on saying the best Lalo Schifrin is on his Jazz and soundtrack albums. He is specially a master in scenes of action on which he lays music with fresh movement, full of rhythm and harmonic insight, generally with the best orchestras and musicians in the place. 'Bullitt', 'Mannix', and 'Mission Impossible' are perfect examples of this.Now that Mr. Schifrin created his own label Aleph Records, these important soundtracks have seen the light of day in CD format. Very good!Unfortunately, 'The Amityville Horror' is a Schifrin's experiment in a series of terror ensembles with the same old clichés of this category. Sleepy!"
__label__2,"Works Great: This is a great product. Very simple to operate and does a great job tying down loads whether on the roof, in a trailer or in the back of our SUV."
__label__2,i love it: I bought this skirt in black from yandy.com. Yes it has one full slit on the side and one overlapping slit in front. It is very sexy. I put it with some sheer knee highs and doll pumps to give it a very naughty look for my man. I have a few micro mini's and this one is the only one I actually want to wear. We will buy them in more colors.
__label__2,"Great contemporary collection: I listen to a lot of Brazilian music, both classic and contemporary. This collection from Ziriguiboom is a great view of what is happening now in Brazil. Music that is too deep into the electronica realm does nothing for me. Instead we have some solid performances on here including the stunning and rich vocals of Virginia Rodriguez. Vinicius Cantuaria keeps alive the tradition of soulful singing and guitar playing. I love the rich and throaty voice of Arnaldo Antunes as well as the playful fun of Zuco 103. Overall the disc has a nice flow and is a great starting point for the Brazilian artists of today."
__label__1,"I Threw this Out with the Bag it Came in: When I looked at the excellent song choices on the cover, I thought ""I don't know these bands, but they have excellent taste in music."" Then I played it. Some of the worst audio I have every heard. Very poorly done covers, some atrocious vocals, and boring because they just copy the original arrangements. I need to hear someone else singing ""Alison"" the same way? All of these sound like the artists are playing along with the radio. File this under community theater of rock."
__label__1,"Hate to Give it One Star: Is there an option for zero. The worst I book I have ever read. He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep. I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS."
__label__1,"It truly is awful, but that won't stop people from buying it.: I've seen this movie countless times on cable when I was younger, and even taped it onto a VHS tape for repeated viewings.I think I actually felt my IQ score drop a few points after all those viewings.It truly is an awful movie! The story and gags are just inane.(But that won't stop a lot of people from buying it.)"
__label__2,Great Arrangements of Favorite Holiday Music: An album worth listening to for the arrangements-new twists on old favorites. The lush harmonies and warm jazz feel will lift you out of department store Muzak-madness in no time!
__label__1,"Original is Better: The Last of the Mohicans is my all-time favorite movie--that is in the original format. The DVD sold in the US is the Director's Cut and leaves me with disgust and outrage. The war at the fort is now way too long and my most favorite moments have now been deleted and replaced with counterfeit moments. The music does not even seem to flow the same way. I went to Wal-Mart the other day and found a DVD just entitled The Last of the Mohicans, but don't be fooled. Notice carefully that whoever packaged it is obviously feeling the heat of those like me that feel the same way. They carefully place a paper over the what is truly the original. It is the worse-than-awful Director's Cut. If you want the best edition, buy the VHS version if you can find it or the version from Great Britain which is owned by Warner Brothers not Fox. Even with the lesser quality of the VHS over a DVD, you still will walk away with a far better deal."
__label__1,"Christian Rambos save the world: There's been too much hype about how this book offers a wealth of survival and self-reliance information. Its useful information could go on 5 pages. I can't believe I wasted my time reading the whole thing. On the other hand, if you are a total gun nut whacko, or a fan of George W. & Sarah Palin et al., or a right wing ""Christian"" of the kill-a-commie-for-Christ school, or lover of bloody military adventures, you may like this book. To each his own, but don't expect to learn anything useful in the real world. It's just not there."

__label__1,"Los grandes tambien se equivocan!!!: Se espera y esperaba mas de estos 2 grandes cantantes ambos tienen mucha tela de donde cortar y honestamente con este material se han quedado muy pero muy cortos, debido a que la produccion tiene demasiados arreglos musicales los cuales opacan las voces de Ana Y Miguel al grado que se les escucha un tanto desafinados ya que la musica y los arreglos tienden a ser un tanto tecno y no popno lo recomiendo a nadie a menos que jamas hayan escuchado a Miguel y Ana, asi no notarian la gran diferencia y calidad de material editado por ellos antes. DECEPCIONANTE TRABAJO!."
__label__1,"Great looks, Mediocre sound: I've owned the DAV-c990 Dreamsystem for over two years. Looks great in my living room, but the first thing I noticed is it just doesn't have the best sound, especialy for music cds. Movies sound OK. I am currently having problems with it reading discs, ejecting discs etc. I've gone thru all the troubleshooting I could find in the manual, on line and thru Sony. It still doesn't work.I've learned from research on the web that many people have had the same problems. I hope I can get mine fixed. I recomend moving on to a different unit or brand."

__label__1,Poor service: I ordered this book and another book called International Management Behavior. They were not delivered. I have not yet been refunded my money for International Management Behavior even though I never got that book.
__label__2,"Excellent EM Primer!: As a new disaster director, this is a very useful tool in understanding how a disaster unfolds, and the subsequent response and management that occur. Mr. Alexander provides plenty of real-life examples of disasters to demonstrate the EM principles. The book is more focused on domestic responses in the U.S. than to the international arena."
__label__2,"should be rated NC-17: This is a very intense movie.There are too many scenes of dead people with mutilated bodies. I think it should be rated NC-17 or even X.It has rape, homosexual scenes, violence, beating, severed head, hanging, stabbing, shooting, etc. Too many violence.But it has excellent plot. The viewer is left in a tense suspense and anticipating the final result from ""Who killed Harriet"" to ""Where is Harriet?""It beats Bates Motel in the thriller flavors.It also beats all of the Hancock movies.It is a good movie."
__label__1,"Just the movie: I bought this DVD and it didn't had the bonus cartoons in it. It's just the crappy cartoon itself. It's better known as Countryside Bears in Europe. Dingo Picture movies here in the good ol' US, well I'd never!"
__label__1,"Great Concept -- Poor Quality: I used this staple gun to hang insulation in my garage this weekend. Prior to that, it had probably driven under 10 staples. Initially it was fine, but on the second or third string of staples, it started hesitating occasionally. I'd hit the lever and wait for 5-10 seconds for it to pop and drive the staple. It also started occasionally ejecting the staple tray braking the string of staples and dumping many of them out. The frequency of both problems picked up until the gun was exhibiting at least one of the two problems 1 in 5 times I tried to drive a staple. A bolt from the handle also fell out while I was using it. My project ended when my last string of staples was ejected dumping them behind a bunch of boxes.The bottom line here is that this product is a piece of junk. For driving one or two staples, it may be fine, but mine didn't make it through a full box. Don't waste your money."
__label__1,"Amandine: I think that Amandine by adele Griffin is an exellent book. It tells how tough it is to move from one school to the next and having to worry about making new friends and fitting in.Sometimes in the process we don't always make the right choices. thats what happens to Delia in Amandine. when Delia,an only child, moves from the city to James DeWolf High School her parents constantly badger her on making new friend.And as soon as Delia meets Amandine her parents encourage her to invite her over.When Amandine does finaly come over things take a turn for the worst. Delia is sucked into amandines world of lies.and when Delia tries to get out Amandine makes a move that could hurt Delias entire family and expose the real truth about Delia."
__label__2,"No better for the money: You can buy a grill with more bells and whistles for the same price, but as compared to other grills, will you find something that cooks great AND will last as long for the money? I love cooking whole chickens on this grill, it cooks them tender and juicy EVERY time (Medium-OFF-Medium). My only complaint with the Webers are the [low cost] plastic wheels; not a big deal since I never move it, but they don't match the quality of everything about the product."
__label__2,"Balthus: A wonderful book, considering how little is really known about the great artist, although I wish more personal information had been forthcoming. Some personal photos of Balthus at work are also included.Authored by his son, this book attempts to dispel some of the mystery with a few photos and facts about the great man himself, yet leaves us yearning for more. However the prints of Balthus' most famous works (pubescent girls) manage to maintain the barely restrained sensuality and dreamlike quality of the original paintings - a quality usually lost in textbook prints. Here they are reproduced faithfully, and take your breath away with their sheer eroticism."
__label__2,Reaper madness: I just recently learned about Reaper and had to start from the beginning with season 1. This has become one of my favorite shows even though I didn't learn about it until it had been cancelled. You will love this.
__label__1,"Trite Psychobabble: Over a period of decades sociologists have noticed an interesting trend: people who win Nobel Prizes, run large corporations, championship athletes, etc. tend to have high levels of self-esteem. Conversely, many of the unaccomplished tend to have low self-esteem. In this chicken vs. egg analogy, Steinem and her fellow travelers have arrived at the conclusion that achievement is a derivative of self-esteem. Wrong. Self-esteem, like everything else worth having, is earned. You cannot be given ""self-esteem pills"". If it makes Steinem feel any better, a generation is being inculcated with the values she espouses in this book i.e. ""I'm OK, You're OK"". Later in life, when confronted by failure, these citizens won't look for the causes in themselves (""It can't be my fault, I'm OK""). They will reach for politicians and leaders on the right and the left who will be more than happy to supply scapegoats."
__label__2,Works great: This is easy to install and program. Make sure you have the correct lift motor that can be programed with this as it requires a certain programming button. The code is easy to set and you can also set a temporary code in case of guests or temporary uses. The back light is red and not too abrasive to the eyes at night and the pad is slim and nonobtrusive.
__label__1,"nonsense renewed: This book is not about ""a revolutionary psychotherapeutic treatment"" as advertised. It's a throwback to the nonsense beliefs of the Dark Ages. Demon possession??? Give me a break! A past life affecting present behavior?? Impossible, unless you have a memory of your previous beliefs and values! This is a book of fiction for the gullible, and/or religious fundamentalists."
__label__1,3:10 to Failure: Thank God they can't erase the original movie from my mind with this one.A very poor attempt to duplicate a TRUE WESTERN CLASSIC ! They butchered the original story line and added way too much garb. This will make you want to see the original with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin and appreciate it even more.I had HIGH HOPES for this movie when I heard it was coming out. Too much HOLLYWOOD BS ruined this classic for the remake. The original classical music was missing as well. I will not be adding this to my western collection.
__label__2,How a scholl should be run: I read this book because I attended this school and graduated in 1959 when this program was still in it's infancy. Dr Beggs was a very wonderful and exciting educator! As I followed the progression I better understood his motives in implementing this system of teaching! EVERY teacher ought to be required to read this book! Every school administrator needs to follow this books example of how to educate our children. Many of the Lakeview grads of this time have gone on to become corporate CEO's and important community leaders in education across the nation!
__label__2,"Makita 12V Batteries: I purchased 2 of these model 1222 Makita 12v batteries to get me back up and running again. Both of my previous batteries had gone down relatively close to each other. I had contemplated upgrading to an 18v tool, but that would have more than doubled my cost. For the DIY work that I do, these are just fine. The only rub that I have is that they are purchased through a third party and you can't take advantage of the super saver that is offered through ecom directly. Outside of that, the shipment was flawless - on time and in perfect condition. These batteries come in a carded blister container."
__label__2,"I agree with Jabber--completely sterilizes my mouth!: This excellent mouthwash coverts my petrie-dish, bacteria-teeming palate into an arid wasteland devoid of malodorous germs. The cool, minty flavor neutralizes any hint of the garlic I devoured on last night's pasta primavera. The blue color is soothing and refreshing, like liquefied sapphires. I am not a shut-in, but that is beyond the point. Anyone, even hygeine-conscious socialites can get halitosis. I am relieved that whenever my mouth smells like a sewer trench, I can pop open a bottle of Listerine and swish germicidal juice around in my mouth until I spit out a liter of dead staphylococcus. That the Listerine tastes like glowing radioactive peppermint is a definite plus. I am a firm believer that if a scientist would experiment in a lab with various chemicals and different flavors of Listerine, he would find the cure to the Ebola virus, flesh-eating bacteria, and other parasitic infectious agents."
__label__2,"VAMPIRES: Ok Now Even thow I havn't read this book.My mom has and she said it was a great book.But I did see the movie ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" ok now the movie was da bomb it was very gory and scary but sum of the parts from the book are missing from the movie ((Thats what my mom said)). But the movie was really cool I want to see it agian.But as soon as it comes out on video I'm getting it. I think every Vampire lover should see it and read the book. I have spoken."
__label__1,"Not worth the money: The reviews posted are hype, not for real. This is a piece of trash, not worth the packaging it came it. The instructor is straight out of the 30's if you ask, talks soooooooo slow, assumes everyone who's watching here is a complete idiot, and the best part, teaches you ABSOLUTELY nothing about proper violin technique and how to play. I've easily found better lessons free on the web and YouTube than anything found in this DVD. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. But the marketing hype is really great, sure suckered me into buying it."
__label__2,"Nice Quality: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the leather and its quality construction. This is a very nice product, especially for the price."
__label__1,disappointing humidifier: after lots of research this seemed like the best option but it is really loud. would not buy again.
__label__2,"Sensually entertaining: This book reminds me of why I read for pleasure! ""Spending"" has it all as far as I'm concerned. We discussed it in our ""Six Women and a Book"" group and there is nothing like a book containing so many contemplations and so much sex to get women talking and laughing. Her mastery of role reversal of artists and muses was a point of lengthy discussion for us. I loved this book and plan to read Mary Gordon's others."
__label__1,"An old book: This book was published in 1984 and much of the information in it is way out of date these days. If you want it just for the pictures fine, but look for another book if you want real useful information."
__label__1,"This CD stinks: For those of you expecting classic Carly Simon, don't buy this CD. It's awful. I can't believe how many wonderful reviews are here regarding this recording. These old re-hashed tunes do not mesh with her voice, and all seem to have the beat S-L-O-W-E-D down to a geriatric tempo that will send you to sleep. I gave my copy away to someone else who thought they might like it. I think it's gathering dust on her bookshelf."
__label__2,"My daughter loves it.: We unfortunately, have not yet had snow, but this was, by far, the best Christmas present my 2 year old received this year. She managed to convince everyone around her to pull her around the house the entire day, and continues to do it every time she gets her hands on it. And when we're not pushing her, she puts her dolls and Elmos in it and pushes them.There are ocassional presents that you feel good about making the investment in terms of getting your money's worth. This was definitely one of those.Also, in terms of delivery. I ordered it the Wednesday before Christmas, and it was in my driveway by Friday."
__label__2,Happy Customer: I am for the most part very happy with my purchase. The only disappointment is when the volume is above 4 it has a metalic sound. Looks great and operates better than I expected.
__label__2,"Henson's Dark Masterpiece: I've loved this film ever since I was a kid, and I still enjoy it now, even though I'm in my twenties. This has to be one of Jim Henson's greatest children's movies of his career. It incorporates adult themes into a language that children can easily understand and its dark ambience conveys the seriousness of the story and the mood in which it should be viewed. The puppets and animatronics were done very well for its time, and those puppets are probably sitting now in his creature shop, part of a vast museum of his wonderful creativity. The story focuses on the relentless battle between good and evil and the unlikely hero that will save the world from its darkest demons. There's a wonderfully gifted cast of voices for the Skeksies and the Mystics, and the score is moving and befitting to the story. Anyone who likes the Muppets will love this flick, even if you're a grown-up. It'll bring out the kid in you, but it won't make you feel childish!"
__label__2,"The reborn of the greatest Japanese band in 90s: The is the first album after the band has a year break. What we found in this album is something very different from the previous album, but most of them have a more negative attitude then before. The changes tells us the band still on their way to find out more possibilities about themselves. The music gene varies throughout the album: rockers, folks, ballads. But something links them up is what the trademark of Mr.Children: the sentimental melody, whatever a warm or sorrow one. It's not surprised to see that they have some experiemental tracks on this album, but it's surprising to have more then the previous albums, which may affect their selling record after a year break. Whatever, it's the band's most challenging album, and it's nice to see that they're not only focus on the selling. For the best track on this album, I picked the most touching track 10."

__label__2,Works Great!: This case was a replacement for a very worn case. it works well to protect the Palm PDA when in a hip pocket.
__label__1,"Great for a month, then...: PROS:-Good looking watch.-Fairly easy to use.-Love the fact that the watch face is twisted to make viewing it while I run easier.-The watch's wrist band held up well, unlike the Swiss Army watches I've had crack on me.CONS:-After only a month's use, the plasic wrap that encases the watch itself started to detach and warp. It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch. It's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months, the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside. From diving deeper than its 100M rating, you ask? No, from sweat and shower water. The digital display is now failing and I'll soon have to throw the watch away like a piece of trash. That's just unnaceptable, Nike."
__label__1,"Too much graffiti: Was quite surprised that it came totally marked up by someone with some words even obscured in the copy. Delivery was fast but even though a second hand book, I've never gotten one through ecom that looked so bad."
__label__1,"Poorly designed - Unsupported after Warranty Expires: Buttons are hard to push. After one year, commonly used buttons started to wear out - had to push very hard on narrow buttons to make work. Called, emailed Logitech several times - they would not replace product even though model failed nor could they even offer a service at my expense to repair. Offered refurb model at over $120. I am considering URC RFS200 wireless remote at $85 new. Appears to function in similar fashion with an extender in the closet with all of my A/V components. No longer a fan of Logitech products."
__label__2,Awesome: Walt Longmire is one of the best characters I've ever read about. Craig jumps out of the gate strong with this first in the series. Read this and you will not be sorry.
__label__2,A cinematic historical potpourri...a rare treat!: This collection is a unique addition for any film/history buff. A must have and well worth the purchase.
__label__2,"The Essence of Detroit House: If I did not know it there is no way I would believe this guy (St. Germain) did not grow up in Detroit. His original influences must have been based out of the detroit Techno house scene (MayDay & Innercity). The song ""Prelusion"" is by far the best track on this cd but the other tracks (maybe not as smooth or jazzy as what we would get from St. Germain's later releases) are certainly up to par. This is a mid to uptempo house album that is definitely worth purchasing."

__label__2,"Overcoming Adversity...: A moving story about Greg Yance(Epps) a young man who is a drug dealer that is busted and thrown into the prison system. He is given a chance at early release in a Military type program. There he is forced to deal with a rival gang member, help build a levy in a town for an upcoming storm, and learn about who he is and what he is made of.Ultimately this is a story about overcoming what obstacles lay before you. There are some very powerful and moving performances by the support cast including Delroy Lindo and Rachel Ticotin. The film has a true and honest feel. It's filled with the bad parts of life and the hope that can shine through even in the darkest of times."
__label__1,"Low grade adhesive...: The weatherstrip is well made and easy to install, but even after properly cleaning all of the surfaces, the adhesive that was on the strip is of poor quality and started ""detaching"" from the door frame.I solved that by applying some automotive trim adhesive, but, I should not have had to. But, with my ""fix"" the weatherstrip has performed well and sealed out the cold, which has been extreme over the last couple of months."

__label__1,"It's fun but...: The game itself is fun. The same sort of fun playing with a retarded kitten is: it'll provide hours of joy, but no real depth to the experience.That, however, is not the point. The point has been made far more eloquently than I care to make my review: The DRM is intolerable. Bug off EA. This is the last game published by EA that I'll buy until two things happen: EA buggers itself with a public apology and compensation to all of its legitimate, paying customers, and it takes the stick out of its rear and stops treating us like thieves."
__label__1,"Not worth the money: While there were some interesting quotes, this book will leave most fans feeling somehow cheated since the entire book could be read by any child or adult in one sitting. It's definitely not so much a book that was researched and then written as it is a book composed of a bunch of quotes all randomly thrown together. There are much better books out there on racing so save your money and buy one of them."

__label__2,"Beautiful Book: I highly recommend this book. It has photographic step by steps showing how to make basic beads through very complex beads. I bought this along with Cindy Jenkins, Making Glass Beads. While there is overlap, I have no regrets buying both. Well worth owning for a beginning beadmaker!"

__label__1,"What a Waste!: I tolerated ~20 minutes of this flick until I figured enough of my time had been wasted. This twenty minutes investment resulted in <<20 seconds of humor. Sorry, but this flick is pure unadulterated CR*P! It doesn't deserve one star."
__label__1,"Nightmare of a movie!: Not only is this bad it is sleep inducing!You won't be afraid to fall asleep you have trouble staying awake. To all these so called movie company's please: Stop making remakes with worse actors Teen silliness that is more 90's than any other decade! This movie is 1)Not scary!)2)Has little violence and no campyness, nudity or fun! 3) Freddie is played in a dull boring way with Cristian Bale's Batman gargle as a voice! 4) This movie doesn't pay homage to the original or hold a little candle to it. Making it was a mistake but they did it anyway to make money from the name!I can't believe Micheal Bay put his name on this but I'm not a big fan of his credibility(He got help from Spielberg I'm sure with Transformers)Anyway the horror films from Dimension Extreme, France and Japan as well as independent film makers from the US., that don't make the theater are far better!"
__label__1,"Content is OK, but....: I haven't watched all the discs yet. The content is OK, but I have a major complaint about the way the DVDs are set up. Depending how your DVD player works, you may have a problem avoiding being forced to watch previews of other DVD products. Other companies do this, but the real problem here is that the previews on the 1st disc are for South Park and Chappelle and they are very offensive. Just because you like Ren and Stimpy doesn't mean You enjoy being assaulted by those other shows. If you do watch these and there are any children or guests present, you might wish to first mute the DVD player. This is so stupid and inconvenient. If you want Chappelle, buy Chappelle, I don't want to censor that, but why do the rest of us have to be inflicted with it without choice, simply to watch Ren and Stimpy?In any event: BE WARNED -- THE DVD ADVERTISEMENTS ARE NASTY!"
__label__2,"Enjoyable sequel.: This expands on the events of 'The Nail', and anyone who enjoyed that excellent volume will need this too."
__label__1,"Immature, unlikeable main character.: I was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book. Instead, it was so boiler plate that I knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what I already knew. Also, the characters were just dull or in the case of Meagan, annoying. The entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable. Actually, the entire book could have been a high school writing project."
__label__1,Flimsy and overpriced: This is too flimsy for most adults. I'll probably give it to my young daughter. Recommend at least a 2mm chain. Bottom line: This is way overpriced.
__label__1,"Um I don't know ............................................: I fell into the trap of seeing this movie to find out more on Princess Mia's fate. What a total dissapointment. I fell asleep half way through it! I feel this movie was made for 2 year olds. It was just to plain and predictable. Now I do think Anne Hathaway is funny but at times it just doesn't look natural. After five years of being princess, she should've tamed her clumsiness. It's just too silly at times. Not even Julie Andrews could save this movie. Her lines are not funny! The writer didn't put enough drama as in the first film. It was a little fast paced but I do think that it was interesting to see how difficult it is to have a relationship when you are a princess and the stress of having to marry someone without love. If you have tots see this one, if not I say skip it."
__label__1,"Almost usable.: The shape of the hard plastic ear hook was designed to cause pain - note the 2 hard plastic jagged corners turned towards your ear while the rounded portion faces up and away from any skin that it could interfere with harming.My second complaint would be that you must hold it against your ear to be able to hear anything thus defeating the point of a ""hands free"" headset.The price is good and if you wear it in silent places where you stand a chance of hearing through it then it's almost usable but I've gotten Motorola 500 headsets for about the same price on ecom and they work much better and are comfortable as opposed to painful."
__label__2,"Inexpensive and easy to install: This print server was simple to install. The low price and network speed were major factors in the purchase but the ease of installation was a major benefit. I also like the fact that it is so small. I didn't have to find a location for the box, it just plugs into the back of the printer. Getting it operational on the network was no problem at all. I would definitely buy it again."

__label__1,YOU DO NOT GET WHAT IS SHOWN: I ordered this Salada DECAF White/Green Tea Blend because I had tried it somewhere and loved the taste. I looked in many stores but could not find it. Everyone had Decaf Green and Decaf White but nobody had the blend of both. I was SO HAPPY when I found it shown and listed on ecom so I was thrilled to order the case of 6 boxes. It arrived a week later only to be 6 boxes of the Decaf WHITE Tea and NOT the blend as advertised on this website. BE careful ordering this most likely you will NOT get what you ordered.

__label__1,"Please choose another one: I don't recommend this camera at all... I bought this camera for my vacation but the shot button doesn't seem to work everytime. It seems like the camera is taking a long time of trying to focus (especially outdoor!) and that takes me out of many chances for wonderful pictures. Also, I only used it for 5 rolls of film so far(I will return it tomorrow, no more), and there's already 1 roll got stuck and I have to bring to the camera store to recover my pictures...it's really a horrible experience."
__label__2,"can't 'can't take my eyes off of you!': I really like this soundtrack. Likely because i don't own a whole lot of this type of music [yet]. Like many i would have replaced clintons song with 'can't take my eyes off of you' sung by heath.....and i recall some other songs i really enjoyed in the movie that aren't on the soundtrack. I agree, they ought to put out another CD. I guarantee we would buy it if it had some joan jett, bnl, cant take my eyes off of you....and even better if it had stiles reciting her poem. Hmm...all this wishful thinking is making me sad. otherwise, and awesome soundtrack....definitely eclectic and interesting....."

__label__2,"Unusual Love Story: I finally bought this when it came out in paperback. I kept looking at it before, but could never make up my mind. I'm glad I read it. It is a very unique love story. In the beginning, it was difficult to follow the time traveling. I eventually got the hang of it and I really cared about the characters. The author shares amazing ideas about time, fate and causality. Henry meets Clare when she is only six, but he is an adult traveling back in time. It sounds a little weird, but he behaves himself until she is eighteen. Up until then, they just have a friendship. They are soulmates and Clare knows Henry for most of her life. She spends a lot of time waiting for Henry, but the story moves quickly. Time travel isn't all it's cracked up to be and Henry is in danger during many of the experiences. This is a great read."

__label__2,"Great Movie. some things were historically off: I really enjoyed this movie. I am really big on the ancient Picts. and I do like the way they were portrayed in this movie. The only thing I found was wrong was that Agrolica was not around during the time of Hadrian. He was around during the time of Dominantion and had died in 96AD. this story took place during 117AD. I liked the fight scenes and the mind set of how the Picts thought. I know the Romans are supposed to be the good guys, but I understand why the Picts were the way they were. They didn't want to be told how to live their lifes and the Romans couldn't see that."

I don't know if it was the vampire theme but this wasn't my favorite of the Alex Cross books. I just found myself being grossed out for much of the book. After Roses are Red, I was dying for the next one but this one didn't do it for me. But I won't stray, I will be waiting for the next book with anticipation. So it wasn't horrible but it wasn't his best either."

__label__2,"Best of a not well known band: These two albums are the best of angel. If you like high energy Rush/Kiss 70,s hard rock you will like this. Forget what they look like, it was just a gimmick that didn't work too well."
__label__2,"Good , but one of the weaker Gundam titles: Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made."
__label__2,"Great lathe: This is a great lathe for the money. It's bigger than the 9 by 20 and a lot beafier at close to 400lbs. I had to face the back of the 4 jaw chuck but other than that, it's reasonably true. If I had more room, I would have bought a 12 in lathe, which is more professional type and more accurate but this was the largest I could lug around my basement and it is good enough for my purposes. I replaced the switch after a bout 4 years use but that's all"
__label__2,"Small but worth it: This is a good little product. I don't use it everyday or anything, but for dips, butters, etc. it's brilliant. Mine worked fine upon arrival and still works well."

When season 2 ended just this past month, I found myself rewatching season one because I couldn't be without it until season 3 premieres. The writers have scored a hit with this series.

__label__2,Excellent Sounding Lightweight and Comfortable Headphones: I bought these headphones to take to the gym because I wasn't happy with my ... Sony earphones. The sound from the PX 100 headphones is absolutely beautiful. The headphones are extremely comfortable. I can use the cardio equipment at the gym without the headphones moving around. They have a sturdy metal headband that adjusts for the size of your head and come with a very handy carrying case. Sennheiser also warrants the headphones for two years and that is really nice. These headphones are a great value for the money and ecom.com offers a really good price. I also own a pair of Bose Triports that cost ... and these headphones sound about as good for a fraction of the cost and are more comfortable.

So I ordered a used copy of this cd because I was curious about what they had done previously. It's hard for me to write a description of what this sounds like, but I will say this - this cd - at times - sounds like a slightly edgier Nelson. So, not good. Just trying to help you curious Further fans. Don't do it."

__label__2,"Very entertaining: I really liked this book, it was a mystery/crime type of story and the characters were very entertaining. When the book started I thought that the police in charge of the investigation was going to be the lead character, but he wasn't. The lead character, a newspaper reporter, was smart and sexy and funny. The book had a few twists and turns that were unexpected, so it wasn't a book that you could predict the end by the time you were half was through. It was a very enjoyable read."

__label__2,"Boring: Very boring. Im not a book reader. Thats why i purchased the audiobook. Compared to anything else done by Jon Stewart, this was completely boring. Id rather listen to him just speak his mind. But the way I figure it, I dont pay anything to watch the daily show, and I didnt pay anything to go see it live, nor did i pay anything to see any of his appearances on other programs, so even if it sucks, im glad I bought it just so I can support Jon Stewart's endeavors. And id buy anything he puts out for the same reason."
__label__1,"Out of his League: James White's attempt to do theological battle with a Bible scholar of Norman Geisler's magnatude is akin to a middleweight boxer fighting a heavyweight. Reformation theologians like Mr.White need to decide whether they want to follow Biblical teachings or the teachings of men, and in this case Hyper-Calvinism and the Bilble are not compatible. Having heard Mr.White debate this topic before it seems apparent he has a very mechanical thinking process. The endorsements on the front and back of the book are extremely mean-spirited. Mr.White seems to have a need to use cheap debate tactics to make up for his unbiblical view of election. Dr. Geisler has done a great service in exposing the false view of Hyper-Calvinism and the success he has in doing so predictably has brought out the wrath of his opponents. If you want the Biblical view on the doctrine of election read ""Chosen but Free"" by Dr.Geisler."

__label__1,"Come on Kayslay, what is this?: I bought Kayslays Pain From the Game about a week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule;). I read that it featured production by Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Eminem and the Heatmakerz. And as far as rappers go, most of the Shady/Aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists (fat joe, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Scarface, Memphis Bleek and Prodigy, etc). So I expected this cd to be a big step up from the Streetsweeper Volume 1 mixtape (which I would give 3 stars at best). But for all the talent on this cd there's not many good songs. I thought the production was pretty weak. Some no name guy produced most of the cd but even the kanye west, swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland. If you have to have every song your favorite rapper or producer ever made, grab this disc. If your looking for good music leave this one alone."
__label__2,"Mr. Potts is a true find: Occasionally lightening strikes a seemingly average person with well above average talent. After receiving an e-mail with a link to YouTube and Mr. Potts' audition on the British talent competition TV series, I was stunned with his talent and ability to win over an audience. I've never been an opera fan but I took a chance on ""One Chance"" and do not have any regrets. This is a significant debut CD for an awesome talent. Paul Potts will be thrilling us with his talent for many years to come."
__label__2,"Worked great for us: This DVD gave my daughter (almost 3 years old) the motivation to give up diapers. It also explained to her very well the logistics of going potty, in a patient way that helped me because I was at my wits-end. She started watching it about two weeks before we had a ""potty party"" and we quit diapers cold turkey We have had only a few accidents since (about 2 months). I think this DVD works best for older kids (almost 3, or over) because they're much more able to understand, relate and listen to the characters."
__label__2,"Such a wonderful story: I loved this book so much, I started re-reading it immediately. I thought the characters were a hoot and so real. I don't often laugh out loud when reading a book, but I surely did with this one. Having been involved with 5 children/stepchildren's weddings, I found the whole deal really humorous. I thought Woodrow was the best character. Such a great book!!"
__label__2,"Fantastic ending to the trilogy: I was amazed how the author tied in soo much into the storyline of ""A New Hope."" Also, after reading these books, I feel like I knew so much about key characters that I never understood before. Characters like Lando, the Hutts, and even Han that you see in the movies but know nothing of their past experiences and how they tie in to everthing. Very well put-to-gether trilogy.. I don't remember reading any books before these that I enjoyed as much."
__label__2,A good read from Bob: An interesting take on life from the mind of Mr. Newhart. He has a dry comedic mind that I wish more people would had. By George he wrote a history of his own life through his eyes. A funny bookfrom a funny man in a funny world..
__label__2,"It was a good book: The only problem was that there wasnt alot of scenes with Sailor Mercury in them,but I liked it. So if you like any of the outer scouts then you should definettly get it."
__label__1,"Worst book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!: This book was terrible. In the past year I have read over 200 books and this is the worst!!! The first two chapters were good and had lots of potential, but the rest of the book is psycho!! It changes to the inside of the main character's mind. I hoped with every page it would get better, it didin't. SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can not express how bad it is."
__label__2,"The most remarkable book you'll ever read.: ""Ariel: A Book of the Change"" was Boyett's first novel, and arguably his finest. You're hooked from the first page, and by the end of the first chapter you're in love. I first read ""Ariel"" when it was initially published, in 1986. Everyone I've ever loaned it to has had the same response: ""What an AMAZING book! Do you have anything else like it?"" -- and the answer is: no. There is NOTHING else like it. This is one of those rare books (the only such book I've ever read) that actually causes you to mourn at the end, because you must take your leave of characters that have become dear to you.How I wish for a sequel.It's definitely worth the effort to find a used copy of this book, and a shame that the publisher has not seen fit to re-issue it."
__label__2,"A sweet read: Picking up this book and reading any page has been helpful for me to connect with myself and to other people. I have noticed my mood becoming lighter from reading it. I love the message, especially since I work inthe substance abuse field - everything we do to cover up our feelings that prevents us from being with ourselves can be seen as an addiction. And it is the human condition - not just hard drugs or alcohol are addictions. I think the sooner that we see this, the sooner we can feel less ashamed and be able to ""come clean"" about the crazy stuff we do.This book has really helped me in my personal life and as an addictions counselor in terms of having more love and compassion and purpose in my life."
__label__2,"Handbook of Batteries: a very good book on tips of batteries. if i had never even read it, i would have died of an electrical shock my sister almost gave me.Read this book, it could save your life."
__label__2,"The best handicapping book: You can see the author's brilliant ideas such as parimutual game charateristics, physics(wind), mathematical concept(large sampling), horse's develoing and declining physical conditions."

__label__2,"Works Great, but Careful on the Dose: I have a 14 year-old American Eskimo who still likes to chew daily. Before buying this, we had her in for an annual dental, but I honestly don't think she's going to need it any more. My only caution on this is to not overdo the gel dosage. Whenever I do, she's keen to find grass to munch on to settle her stomach. A few times, she's thrown up. So I'm learning, and as long as I use the correct dose, she's fine.The spray is a good idea, but harder to use. I'm never sure if I'm getting it where it needs to go."
__label__2,"Dirty Memphis Underground: This album is the work of a lyrical madman. The dirtiest, grimiest down south rap you will ever listen to. This is absolutely one of the best, and rawest cd's in my collection. If you like something not so mainstream, but with some chilling gangsta beats, pick up a copy of this one and roll up a fatty for this pimp daddy."
__label__1,"Huh?! What happened?: What happened here? Is this seriously Chris Rea?That's what pops into my head when I start trying to listen to this so-called successor to ""The Road to hell"".I'm rather disgusted by this entire affair.Somebody tried to pull a Clapton/Simon Climie ala ""Pilgrim""It's my least favorite Chris Rea release. In my humble opinion his worst release. It's a rather annoying release and almost unlistenable. I was highly disappointed by this. My least played Rea album and one that now simply sits in my collection."
__label__2,Really nice quality: Very nice product. Good quality. Wears well. Large enough for good coverage. Other ones like this are usually small and thus cannot be wrapped properly. I HIGHLY recommend.
__label__2,"Silver Nemesis Story 154: ALL of Doctor Who stories are great! The Whoniverse is GREAT!The original meeting of the Silver Nemesis and Doctor Who is not known to me. It is referred to during the story.Also, a future meeting is talked about. I would like to know if that ever happened.I doubt it as Doctor Who ended production with Sylvester McCoy.That would be a good story line (are you listening Doctor Who Writers?) HA!All of the Whoniverse is worth watching! But then true Whovians know this already!"
__label__1,"This reprint edition is bad: This edition I bought, being the 3rd or 4th edition (its not stated) reprinted in 1982 by TIMES BOOK INTERNATIONAL SINGAPORE is badly reproduced as the photos are not as sharp as the original edition (published 1957 by Donald Moore Galleries Singapore and printed by MacGibbon and Kee, London).Also some photos have been replaced and not stated so accordingly nor acknowledged anywhere in the book. Very disappointing!"
__label__2,Great set!: I'm amazed at the quality for this price!! These are solid and sharp. Don't hesitate to buy; shipped very quickly as well. A++++++++++++++++++
__label__2,"lines you never forget: ""And I don't like the panties drying on the rod"" is a classic. Dreyfus is in his element popping off one liners, but Quinn Cummings was a delight as Paula's wise beyond her years daughter."
__label__2,"Jeremy Robert Johnson has a new fan!: I picked up this book a while back when I first started reading bizarro fiction.I have since read quite a few different authors in this field, and JRJ is without a doubt in my top 3.Very dark and strange, and written with a born talent for storytelling, all of these stories had me enraptured.Keep it up!"
__label__2,"Adrenal Fatigue by James Wilson: This book is very enlightening & thorough. Great illustrations that explain how the adrenal glands work. Somewhat long beginning of book until you get to the action items- rest, limit, boundaries & supplements."
__label__1,"Boring literature: I expected a lot of this book because I've read better works from Redfern, but this one is a collection of different and not updated pieces of information, that really bring nothing essentially new. There are not secrets exposed beyond getting to know some secret places used for processing data by the British intelligence."
__label__2,"Superb follow-up: Ender's Shadow continues the Ender Saga in a most satisfying way. As a parallel to the original, it casts an intriguing new light on the main figures and creates new angels of view. And it is damned well-written!"
__label__1,"The Pregnancy Purchase that I Regretted the Most: I read the reviews, which were mostly bad, then bought the product anyway. I figured that if I followed the instructions it would work. I tried desperately to make this product work. I used it all through my pregnancy (to the last month) and it never worked for me. I am still resentful about it. It's been my biggest waste of money so far (the diaper genie being the next biggest.) Hope this was helpful."
__label__2,"an awesome book: this is a book that combines romance, fantasy, and historical fiction. it is about this girl who accidently wrecks her dad's BMW and is wishing that she could be someware else when she is magically transported to 15th century england. she meets king Edward VI, and in trying to save him from dying(which in truth he did at age 15) she ends up almost causing a revolution. she falls in love with the kings 'whipping boy' and the story goes from there. it is a REALLY good book except i think that maybe girls would enjoy it more, but yeah you should definatly read it.:-) rachel"
__label__2,One of the best albums i've heard in a while: Teedra is very underrated.This album is fantastic from start to finish!Hopefully one day she'll get the shine and credit she deserves.
__label__2,"Highest recommendation I can make!: I have became the biggest fan of Joan Sutherland lately, and I bought this set because of her. And I'm not diappointed at all. In fact, I'm elated. Not only do I get to hear THE DAME in wonderful voice, but got some lovely music and other charming singers as an added bonus. This cd has made me a Mozart fan. HIGHEST recommendation I can make!!!"
__label__1,"What the f**k!!!: My God. This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen. Why? Because its SO BORING, UNIMAGINATIVE, SLOW PACED, BLAND, POINTLESS and a COMPLETE WAISTE OF TIME. The only other reviewer on ecom that I agree with 100% on this film is Eugene Fenlon BA. And he was even being extremely generous by giving this film 2 stars. IT DESERVES NONE! The idiot reviewers on this site that give Hidden 4-5 stars are totally over exaggerating. This film offers nothing new to cinema and its not at all special in any way. Burn this film before it wastes your time."
__label__2,James Griffin sings Bread!!: This is not a Bread cd. There are no liner notes or any information about any of thes songs. However this is the late James Griffin and that alone makes it worth a spot in your cd library. It is true that David Gates sang all of the hits and I love David Gates vocals. However if you really enjoyed the music of Bread you must also love the vocals of James Griffin! I really would love some information on how this cd ever came about. The price has really gone up for this rare gem. I picked this up at Borders for about ten bucks a few years ago. My friend played it for me because it was great to hear Griffin sing all these hits. If you are a real Bread fan and want to hear the great James Griffin sing all the songs that Gates sang then buy this now. It is a very rare cd and you will not be sorry!
__label__2,"Awesome: They are just what they look like, perfect wooden wine racks. Easy to put together and perfect size for a variety of bottles. (Except Champagne)"
__label__2,"Not a total disappointment: The Blair Witch Project is an good film and I liked it a lot. It is very spooky and the atmosphere surreal. I have been a diehard horror film since I was a kid and I thought what made the movie successful is the viewer has to forget the old formula horror films and put themselves in place of the actors. Sometimes it is what you don't know is what makes a movie scary and if you were in that situation, it would be frightening. As far as the shaking of the camera and bad lighting goes, it adds a touch of realism you would expect if you made such a film yourself. In summary, I have always liked off-beat horror films, I have seen some very good ones and some very bad ones, and I would place the BWP towards the good ones."
__label__1,"Don't be fooled!: Got it on major clearance at a big box store, but still overpaid! The plastic straws coming out on the sides do not move, just lay open spraying water on the ground. The ball in the middle spins, but little water comes out, so there was no Geyser Blast for us!"
__label__2,"Review of Every Page perfect: I recently purchased Every Page Perfect by Mary Lynn. I find the book to be indispensable. I don't know what I did without this book. I have used the book and I find a huge difference in the way I present my writing to the public and to editors. I recommend this book to both seasoned writers and beginners out there. Every Page Perfect is 8 1/2 x 11 and shows how to set pages up exactly as an editor would want them for all genres etc. It should be on everyone's book shelf. It is clear, comprehensive and friendly. Don't write without it!keelia"
__label__2,"Excellent ideas for those contemplating divorce!: As a divorce mediator for Divorce Without Battle, I frequently deal with clients who are undecided about taking this big step (divorce is often equated with death as to the impact it has on the family). Without hesitation, I heartily recommend this book to both spouses. Often they see that there is still hope and, although I lose clients this way, it is tremendously rewarding to see marriages saved!"
__label__1,"Absolute S#!T!: What the hell has happened to rock if this passes off as metal. I mean, seroiusly, in metal, you don't sing about ""goin' to the party and have a real good time."" Talk about poser, and then they spout a bunch a stupid rules. Anyone who listens to this corporate crap is a nimrod. Every time I see a kid with those damn system of a down shirts, i wanna ring them out like a wash rag. Alright, i guess you know how i feel know, so i guess ill let you in on something, let some fu@$!%ng taste. Here's some good bands: The Sex Pistols, the Ramones, the Clash, Anti-Flag Green Day, Blink-182, Metallica, Queen, and the Rolling Stones. Don't waste your dough."
__label__2,Pur: Awesome. Wonderful. Superb. I Love it. It is simply the best. I am tired of writing reviews that have to follow ecoms inane rules on length s for right now if I like something this is the review the product will get. Stupendous.
__label__1,"Waaaaaaaaaaaay too small!: I bought this for my baby lab puppy and mercy, he only used it the first week we brought him home. It is super small and he quickly fished out the squeaky on the inside. I ended up giving this to a friend with a cairn terrier puppy - probably a much better fit! This is smaller than the palm of my hand!!!"
__label__1,"Just Bad: I rented this movie because I thought it was a comedy..according to the previews it seemed like it was. The cast was great but the movie was awful. The film tells the story of uptight businesswoman Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) who meets the parents of her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) for the first time during the Christmas celebrations. From the get go, The Stones don't like Meredith, so she calls her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come back her up.I think the main reason for me that this movie was so awful is that every character in this movie was so dreadfully and disgustingly dysfunctional and the film offered me nothing to hope for with no chance whatsoever to even like ANY of the characters.Save your money and save your time. This movie is unfortunately not worth it. If you want to see a dysfunctional family, watch 'Arrested Development', the best written show since Seinfeld.This is not a comedy. This is not a charming holiday film. It is an utterly dumb movie."
__label__1,"Graphic Rape Scene Warning: It is unbelievable to me that any actress would agree to play the role Ms. Anniston plays in this movie. Any person who has ever been the victim of a sexual crime or knows someone who has will get flashbacks from this film. In the rated version the rape scene in the opening 20 minutes was the MOST AWFUL, NASEAUTING piece of film I have ever seen. The plot is based on a woman using a ""rape"" to extort money from a married man. I think it is time for consumers everywhere to let Hollywood know these rape scenes based on male directors wet dreams of rape are NOT entertaining, and do not belong in FILM. I am not saying that rape has no place in film, the scene in A Time to Kill was incredibly effective and very artistic. However this entire movie is based on a ""rape"" which is simply not entertaining."
__label__2,"Best of the Series So Far...: The book starts with Dr. Maura Isles touring the Catacombs of Paris and contemplating her own mortality. That is just the beginning! She returns home to her house to find that her front yard is a crime scene, and the police and her coworkers are looking at her like she is a ghost. That is because they all thought the dead woman in the car in front of her house was Dr. Isles. The book is downright scary at times, and had me feeling really claustrophobic in parts the descriptions were so real. I won't give anything away, but pay close attention to the prologue in this one. I look forward to the next book in the series."
__label__2,Sturdier than I thought: This grater works really well and is made well. It's a lot more robust that I would have thought for the price
__label__1,"Spider-Dog: To me, this is a clear-cut case of cruelty to animals. Yeah that dog looks pretty happy doesn't it? How you would like it if someone forced you to dress up in a ridiculous looking costume for Halloween? At least humans do it voluntarily. Man these costumes are horrible. They should be banned from all existence. And why is the mask so utterly useless? Theres nothing even remotely mask-like about it. It just a scrap of cloth on the dog's head. Poor dog. I wonder if the dog can shoot webs out of it's paws. Then it could entangle the manufacturer of this suit in a web, see they how they like that."
__label__2,"Hmmm...: This CD is ok. I'm still listening to it, but after a few listens, you get used to the songs. I have to admit that I liked ""Room For Squares"" better, and that the first time I heard this, I was a little disappointed. (It was an ""iffy"" kind of album.) But once you listen to it a lot, I'm sure you'll love it. One thing that's really disappointing is that it only has ten songs. I'd recommend borrowing it and burning it instead of buying it. It's still good, but not as good as ""Room for Squares""."
__label__1,"sounds like all the other asian underground albums: This album is a kind of electro-ethnical world-beat album with a lot of repetitive loops and boring beats. A great dust collector. You should look instead for Banco de Gaia, Cheb i Sabbah, or Talvin Singh, their works are more sophisticated, and more ""well-constructed""."
__label__1,Applied Chemical Hydrogeology: I purchased and used this as an alternate textbook to Drever's Geochemistry of Natural Waters for a graduate level course in Chemical Hydrogeology that I took during completion of my Masters. This is very similar and almost identical to Drever's text. This is not a text that should be used for quantitative problem solving.
__label__1,"Chintzy: Melissa & Doug stuff has gone way downhill in quality. This toy is made of unfinished wood so soft you can gouge it with a fingernail and arrived splintered in some sections, and the paint on the shapes didn't hold up for long to my 10-month-olds' mouths. Many reviewers have also reported across the Internet that they tested the toys for lead in the paint and the blue pieces come up positive! I waited too long to return this item, but I would have. I'm going to get a new shape sorter for my girls. Lesson learned: if you want wooden toys, don't go for Chibese-manufactured Melissa & Doug just because they're affordable. Stick to Haba, Guidecraft, Plan Toys, etc for real hard wood that lasts!"
__label__2,Jullian Michael: Her video is great. I got it because I loved her on the biggest loser and the workout video is exactly what I thought it would be
__label__2,"Well Done: This is an excellent read but not for its factual details about WWII (therefore, the 4 stars).Foley is brutally honest as he struggles to surface, and understand, his memories into written words. It quickly becomes apparent that the other people in the book are simply supporting characters as Foley attempts to understand the changes he was experiencing in his mental makeup.I have read numerous personal accounts of men at war but never have I been `allowed' to truly feel conflict through one man's struggle as experienced in Foley's book.As I continued to read I found myself changing as Foley changed; from color to black and white as he strips away all the glory and mundane details and focuses instead on the basic human need of physical and MENTAL survival. I believe that was his goal and he accomplished that end brilliantly.It was a healing read and I thank Mr. Foley!"
__label__2,"Very spiritual and moving: This album is my favorite of all Depeche Mode albums, and I have been a fan for over 20 years now. The tracks have a dark, but soothing sound. My favorite tracks are Mercy In You and Higher Love. This is a breakthrough album because D.M. uses real instruments for the first time, including electric guitar. I Feel You has a harder edge and is a good opening song for the album. The rest of the tracks flow in a rhythm pattern ranging from very dark to spiritual. Never heard anything like it."
__label__2,great tools: I have been a fan of Belleruth relaxation products since my first on cassette tape. I feel that she is one of the best and I have been to an all day presentation that she did and found it remarkably wonderful. You will definitely be very pleased and she is the only one that encourages the body's cells to 'communicate' with each other which is important for all the cells in your body. So do not hesitate to purchase her products--you'll never regret it -- I keep one in the clock radio bedside on 'continuous' and it goes all night. I also have them loaded on my laptop so if I am out of own I have them to listen to on the airplane or in the hotel room.

__label__1,"Attractive, but extremely flawed: Same as you've already read, this blender leaves large food chunks at the bottom of the jar, very rarely truly blending anything. I called Kitchenaid's tech support, they advised me to start with a slow blend speed, and then progressively move up to the faster speeds. This works somewhat, but frozen strawberries & bananas never fully blend. The motor is stronger than cheapo blenders, but much slower. On the plus side, the exterior cleans well, and I've never experienced the bottom falling out as others have (was the base simply unscrewed from the jar?). Choose another brand or a cheapo."
__label__2,"Great item: Bought this product for someone who's charger stopped working. It's nice that you don't have to buy the whole set up when all you need is the AC adapter. This product works, was delivered quickly and nicely packed."

__label__1,Depressing: Obviously so controlled. Not real at all and it is sad how the shows producers try so hard to make the stars (?) feel like crap about themselves. Its a serious phsycological problem and a one hour show bullying them into cleaning up a lifetime of collections is wrong.
__label__2,"A++ for originality and musical craftsmanship: ...a truly wonderful CD by two very talented artists. I love the songs they personally wrote for this CD. I applaud all artists like these two who make this type of commitment to originality and musical craftsmanship! Great to get away from the canned formula music dominating the airwaves these days. Hard to top Truly Madly Deeply from their previous CD (my personal favorite) but this CD was not disappointing. Two Beds and a Coffee Machine and I Don't Know You Anymore are very beautifully written slower songs. Includes popular songs: Affirmation, Crash and Burn, with the rest of the songs keeping up with their high level of talent!"

__label__2,"A Great Start: This is a fantastic collection of seven episodes of the Colgate Comedy Hour featuring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The telecast, with Dean and Jerry as hosts, ran from around 1951-1954. This collection is filled with several funny skits and memorable songs, as well as a stellar supporting cast of classicHollywood film stars. We are also treated to vintage Colgate commercials, as these specials are left entirely intact.As a bonus the duos classic ""At War with the Army"" is features on disc one, and disc five finds ""At the Movies with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis"", where several of the comedy teams sixteen feature films are featured using the original (or re-release) trailers.In short, this collection is a great start to what will hopefully lead to Dean and Jerry's entire cinematic catalog being released to DVD, as well as that of comedian Jerry Lewis's entire solo career.A treasure for any fan of the duo, or a lover of good entertainment."
__label__1,"OOPS: I had high hopes for this watch since it was a Timex. I work in a nursing facility and liked the lighted dial. I was trying to set the time, however, for time change and the whole stem pulled out of the watch making it pretty useless. Silly me. I certainly got what I paid for."
__label__1,"Needs a new translation: Perhaps this is a great novel, but the translation is awkward and crude, without any grace or literary appeal. The story seems to have vast scope and interest and offers meaningful insight to a certain time (1930s) and place (China), but the translating is too off-putting."
__label__1,"piggyback doesn't work: I purchased this cable to connect two devices to a receiver/stereo which has only one RCA input pair.

__label__1,"did Cook really write this book: I own and have read every one of Robin Cook's books, some several times. They are riveting, exciting and well written.With Shock, I was in shock. Here are two female post grads from Harvard, no less, with newly acquired Doctorates in Economics and Microbiology. Then in comes Laverne & Shirley. How Cook expected to pass this off as a well written mystery beats me, the two girls giggled, argued, made a mockery out of average intelligence(to wit, the first and only day on the job, like no one noticed they took 1/2 hour breaks every hour, met at the water fountain and disappeared with no notice) and it was supposed to be a medical mystery. The only mystery is how he managed to keep a straight face as he wrote it. Would not recommend it at all. Unless you get it free or on loan, but remember, I told you so."
__label__2,"Something for everyone: Playboy did a nice job and thought of nearly everything. The models are attractive, the settings can be recreated easily by anyone. Background music is Classic and won't go out of style. Narrator doesn't talk too much and has a soothing voice. It isn't salacious and spends just the right amount of time on each technique. Really liked it."
__label__2,"Larger Than Normal Page Sleeves: These plastic sheet protectors are slightly larger than a normal 8 & 1/2 X 11 which allows them to be used for items such as magazines, they are great for regular size pages plus those slightly larger items."
__label__2,"I re-read this book every 5 years: Whenever I re-read it, which I love because of its pathos if nothing else, I get a new gem of insight. Leon Uris is a masterful writer of historical novels. This book led me to other Uris writings and I have enjoyed them all. But, don't read this or any Uris if you want a happy ending. Realism is his game, and most of the endings - including the one in Trinity - are heartbreaking.The first time I read Trinity, I was still in college and preparing for a semester abroad. In later re-readings, I finally noticed Uris' uber-masculine lead characters, and the fact that most of the women were given little to do but look good and stand by their men. The feminist in me rebels at this kind of writing now, but Uris' books are so good I can overcome it. Also, Uris' books are mostly set in times when women's roles were more limited. So, I guess I forgive him - and will keep reading."
__label__2,"Wonderful inspiration for the faster: This is an excellent addition to any health-conscious individuals library - succinct, to the point and full of good science without a lot of false promises and mumbo-jumbo. Some of the references to individuals, or locations of resorts, clinics etc, are a bit too dated to be useful, but the book stands on solid facts. Compelling!"
__label__1,"Pricey and Clunky: I got this because its the only one thats a square and hence really coordinates with the Simple Lines dinnerware.

I've used it in both CA and Colordo and have yet to have any problems with getting and keeping a signal. In fact, I've used it in my car and have no problems keeping the signal even on a cloudy snowy day. Overall it has delivered on all the features it promises. I read many of the reviews prior to purchasing and was somewhat concerned about the loss of signal that some others have experienced. Needless to say I have not encountered that problem at all. I have been an avid runner for 20+ years and this is truly a remarkable product for runners of all types!Happy running!"
__label__1,"A Bad Pick: Apologies to my ex for giving her this book for her birthday. Very ill-advised. She let me read some of it, which I hadn't done before picking it up at a discount bookstore, and we had a laugh over how bad it is. Oh well. At least we're already broken up. I thought the book was going to encourage girls to cook for their ex-boyfriends. No such luck. Too bad I didn't know about the reviews beforehand. If there's ever a book about bad gifts given by ex-boyfriends, I'll probably be in it after this."

I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper. Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear. I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me. I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine.I haven't really watched the Martha show much, I really enjoyed the original MSL show she started with. Sometimes I get annoyed that the materials seem very exclusive to New York and similiar, but c'est la vie."

The temperature button is right where you hold the handle so you start out with it at the highest setting because it doesn't get hot enough, but as you iron your palm hits the temperature gauge and before you know it is either on low or off. Time to find a new engineer to make a better product!"
__label__2,"A drama and comedy together...just like life: Stuart is an example of a typical family....Dysfunctional to the core. Yet he and the characters in it are as human as anyone around you. This is a very funny movie but has a strong serious side to it. If you have ever been a 12 stepper or in therapy, Stuart is a must."
__label__1,"Disappointed: My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However, after 2 rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down. Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I. Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one."
__label__1,"eh: I like Dave Matthews but this CD all sounds the same to me. After one or two songs, I found myself tuning it out completely. I suppose that's a good thing if you like bland background music, but I was hoping for something more. It's not that I dislike individual pieces, but on the whole, I think I'll try to sell my copy."
__label__2,Does the job: Paper a little thin but does the job. I needed it for decoration of my appartment walls and it looks great. I am happy with this purchase.
__label__2,"air cleaner: perfect size and price, I'm able to have multiply units for different rooms, so I can take advantage of the same replacement filter size"
__label__2,Simply amazing: I read this book ten years ago and it is still unforgettable. I have read many of joy fieldings book since then. A must read!
__label__1,"DON'T BUY THESE, ESPECIALLY FROM ecom: I purchased these shoes about 60 days ago. After verifying the fit and apparent quality, I put them away until closer in time to a trip I will soon be taking. I started wearing them about 2 weeks ago. I have worn them maybe 15 times. The sole on one is coming unglued from the body of the shoe. ecom is of NO HELP WHATSOEVER in resolving my problem. They can not provide any way to contact the manufacturer. The mfr's web site does not have a way to contact them [COMING SOON it says]. ecom offered a $30 credit toward the purchase of another pair?!?!?!?! Not hardly. ecom has permanently lost my business."
__label__1,"It leaves my hair too dry.: After 20 years of dying my hair (w reg. hair dye) monthly, I switched to something less toxic for my hair. I have black hair, so I know I wouldn't be blonde, but I was hoping to get a diff. color. It is dark brown now -not even honey like color. It covered 40% of my gray hairs (I only have few). After I used the product, my hair was SOOOOOO dry and w/o shine. I have to use oil now for my hair to look healthy.I wouldn't buy this brand anymore. I am going to try a diff natural brand to see if it works for me."
__label__2,"Beautiful and delicate: This beautiful necklace was purchased as a gift for a young lady, and we were very pleased with our purchase. It is delicate, detailed, and very expensive looking. A great value for the price."
__label__1,"A bit boring here and there: This book on the life and crimes of Harry Lavender seems to lack the intesity that books need in today`s society. Set in Sydney the book is written on the basis that the reader has been there. Marele Day seems to have put to much complication into it for th average reader. It is a book which seems to relate in someway to the film ""the big Sleep"" in that the reader has to figure alot of stuff out by himself. All in all the author has gone into a bit too much detail."
__label__1,"wearing out: We have owned 3 Sonicare toothbrushes; each one wears out after about 15 months of use. What happens is the timer or the on / off switch seems to go bad. The effect is the unit shuts off after about 30 seconds of use; holding down the on / off switch buys another 10 seconds or so; then 5 seconds; then nothing.For a product as expensive as this, stay away unless replacing it every 15 months is within your plan as it does do a good job cleaning your teeth."
__label__1,"Disappointing listen.: Ben Harper is much hyped but after taking the plunge and listening to this album I was very disappointed. Harper's thin and whiny voice is probably the worst aspect, but the songwriting is insipid and repetitive, the arrangements standard off-the-shelf fare, and the lyrics trite. I'm sorry, but Harper is another derivative sound-alike and lacks the talent and originality to interest me. I'll give him a second-star for the admittedly competent musicianship, however.For all those complaining about the copy protection of the CD, I borrowed it from a friend and ripped it to MP3 using MusicMatch 10 with no problems whatsoever - in fact I only became aware of the copy protection much later while reading these reviews."
__label__1,"Disappointed: I was disappointed with Lakeshore Books because I bought a book in good faith listed as new and it was definitely used.It had highlighter marker all through the text. The store sent the book in a timely fashion, but the advertisementmisrepresented the product."
__label__2,"Great toy.: My kids LOVE this teepee. I ordered it for my son's birthday and both him and his older brother love it (3 and 7 years old). They read, play and sleep in it. It's easy to move around, and it looks great(very neutral blends with any room's decor very well). We have had it for just about 3 weeks and we have been using it inside, so far so good. This toy sparks my kid's imagination, it's very sturdy and I highly recommend it."
__label__1,"Broke after second use.: I was really happy with this product the first time I used it, and I don't think I was very rough on it. I used it for about 4 hours of woodsball and went through a couple of tanks. A couple weeks later I went to use it again, and it let all the air out of my tank, then another tank. Don't know what's wrong with it, and I waited too long to return, so now I'm stuck with it."
__label__1,First impression of Philip Glass' music: This is my second Philip Glass album. I honestly tried to stick with it. It's like listening to a washing machine hoping that the dryer will contribute something interesting.
__label__2,"Important herstory of the rape of women during war: This book is a very important part of womens herstory about the ""rape and pillaging"" of war. For too long the rape part has been silenced because of women's shame and misogyny. Too bad the woman writing the book felt she had to submit it anonymously.Very well written."
__label__2,"Good value for money: This apparel provides good value for money. It's not the most expensive scanner around, though the results are pretty good. I say pretty since I am not impressed with the quality of its output. Also it takes quite some time to acquire an image scan in significant resolution.However, the slide containers are easy to operate, and operating the machine in between other activities is the way to go."
__label__2,"A Solid Release From Underoath: I decided to get this cd after hearing some friends rave about it and I would have to say that for the most part it is very good. This is one of those cds that I enjoy owning so that every once and a while I can listen to a few of the tracks. Yes, this cd is good but isn't one that you can listen to from start to finish every time. My only complaint is that some of the songs sound a little bit too similar but overall it is worth it. I do think that their older stuff sounds a bit better but its good that can play whatever style they want too. I also like that these guys aren't afraid to put in a strong(somewhat) Christian message into their music. Overall I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes hardcore or metalcore with some good positive lyrics."
__label__2,"Jury's still out on this one.: The jury is still out on this one for me. I am new to Derma e, and overall love their products so far--my skin is very sensitive, and their products haven't caused any irritation. I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really can't tell if it's doing anything. I also bought the Derma e Hyaluronic Acid Rehydrating Serum, which I like much better than this one."
__label__2,"perfect 1080i: going form and LG blu ray player to full HD DLP projector via an HDMI switch and about 125ft of cheap non-name-brand cable works great at 1080i. 1080p introduces digital snow, but possibly a result of the switch. can't remember if it might have been a bit cheaper when i got it a few months ago, but works as advertised."
__label__1,"Bad Reprint: This is probably one of the best Plane Trigonometry books in existence, great explanations of proofs and a great way to see how they did trigonometry ""back in the day."" However, the quality of this reprint is bad. The size of the book is deceiving. When you open it up you have a little 5x3 inch square of writing in the middle of the page. There is about 3 inches of blank space on each side surrounding it. This may be good for notes but the text is really small and a pain to read, not to mention the text itself is light in some areas. I know I'm returning mine to get a better one."
__label__1,"Not enough hands for this bag!: The opening for this bag is impossible to manage while holding a baby! The zipper is hefty, but stiff and once the bag is open, the opening is sooooooooo narrow! Once I get the changing pad out, I can hardly get it back in when I'm finished. I love the meshy outside and zippered pockets; however, there are no guts to this bag for the baby essentials. Once you have the too large changing pad inside, there isn't much room for diapers, wipes and a wardrobe change - forget about food and toys! Boo hiss. I'm still looking for the perfect diaper bag."
__label__1,"jane austen meets david lynch...: from what i've seen so far, about 20 minutes....think jane austen meets david lynch, or something equally as strange....not a fan."
__label__2,"Beethoven's Symphonies 1,2,3,4,5: Typically Beethoven, Symphony #4 lifts you off your chair and sends you away with it's power, and Symphony #5 is also a very strong piece of Music, same for Symphonies 1 and 2. If you love Early Beethoven, and love Classical music that really knocks your socks off then you will love this CD set."
__label__1,"noisy to the point that it is useless: I used the XLR input mainly, I just can't work with a device that produces so much noise. I wish I knew that before I bought it, but now you know."
__label__1,"Far too defused and general: This book assumes too low a level knowledge. As a result a lot of time is spent laying ground work. Everything from OOA/OOD to database technology is covered. For a beginner, this may be appropriate; however, if you are looking for a focused discussion of application servers, look elsewhere."
__label__2,A comfort...excellent information: The information is very informative and very easy to read and understand. You will turn to this book over and over to read and re-read. To know and understand what is happening to you or a loved one is half the battle. You will not be disappointed with this book.
__label__1,It was okay for someone who cooks big meals: I got this book and it was okay but it really is for someone who cooks big meals or has a rather large family . Other than that I had heard of some of these recipes before . I also gave it as a gift to someone rather than seeing it sit on my shelf .
__label__2,"expressive and unique: If you are looking for a title to add to your cd collection that stands out as a truly great piece, give staind that spot. This cd shows in lyrics how a great band can come together and create something for all. I don't participate in this ""battle of the bands"" non-sense that is so common in reviews. By not comparing Staind, you will immediately see this cd for what it is, real and sincere. The thoughts expressed in this cd are one thing as well, alternative. This compilation is not life changing, mosh pit provoking, or suicidal, just a great cd with unbelievable rythem and lyrics"
__label__1,"A Very Messy Waffle Iron: Purchased this because with growing kids who often have friends over, my single waffle iron was just not keeping up. I have a great homemade waffle recipe for traditional style waffles so I did not want a Belgin style maker. Thought this would be great as my single iron is a Cuisinart that works well. The first 4-5 times I used this, my waffles stuck like crazy. Had a heck of time getting them out and I still have to remember to heavily oil the iron prior to using (which I don't like because it gives the waffles an odd crunchy texture when cooked). This waffle iron is also VERY difficult to clean when your waffle batter leaks out. There is a seam around the bottom that the waffle batter leaks into that you have to use a toothpick to get clean. It is also very heavy and bulky for storage. Not impressed at all and wish I had bought a different iron. I suppose at some point I will get frustrated enough that I will pitch it and purchase another brand."
__label__2,"Foul Ball: Excellent, funny read for all minor league baseball enthusiasts. The book also points out the sleazy side of local politics which prevented two individuals from preserving an historic landmark and satisfying the wishes of local residents. Minor league baseball in its original form is a throw back to a simpler time when strong family (and community) values were important. Just as major league baseball is leaving average fans in the lerch due to high prices, much of minor league baseball is moving in the same direction. Thankfully, there are independent teams who are not beholden to major league organizations who will move a team at the drop of a hat for a better stadium deal elsewhere."
__label__1,"Irritating Disappointment: As to whether you should buy the DVD version of the film, I recommend that you buy it if you are a fan of the irresistibly beautiful Jennifer Connelly, or if you are a fan of the precision performances of Keanu Reeves. However, you may be disappointed to find that the movie deviated significantly from the original 1951 version."
__label__2,"Sylvian's syllables simply swivel me !: Loved Japan, loved Brilliant Trees, Secrets of the Beehive and Rain Tree Crow, and love this album !I bought this cd blindly because of the credit Mr. Sylvian has managed to build up in my cd-collection. Listening to Dead bees for the first time, only ""I surrender"" really managed to settle comfortably in my mind. But now, after playing it over and over again (15 times or so) I just can't get enough of the whole bloody album.Why, Mr. Sylvian, do you have to come up with such brilliant music ? But please, do it some more!"
__label__1,Not worth the money: The book is mainly about the author. He wants to make a book out of maybe 4-5 encounters with Feynman.
__label__2,"aztec autumn: not quite as good as the original aztec but worth the read.aztec autumn tells the story of a young man named tenamaxtin who plans to fight the spanish and kick them out of the land they supposedley conquered.its a book of gore, sex, and murder but done better than most books with these ingredients.first read the original aztec then read this one."
__label__1,"Great review information: This book contains great information on reviewing in Science, Math, and Verbal Ability"
__label__2,Enterprise: Very good TV show. To bad it was cancelled. I am watching season 4 as i type this review from my Iphone.
__label__1,"Induced compulsion to upgrade software: Why should the average user spend lots of money, which in turn corresponds to a considerable quantity of sweated work time, which in turn corresponds to time taken away from one's own interests, family and friends, just to buy a new version of an Office suite ? The same job of a new version of, say, a wordprocessor, can basically still be done by a word processor of 20 years ago. Do we really need all these improvements, all these animations, these ""cute effects"" etc. when what we need is simply write a letter or a report and spell-check it? In most cases not at all. But software houses are very good at inducing people to buy their products and let them believe the new version will make them save time: but to save that time they have to work more to pay the bill.This induced compulsion to ever upgrade one's systems is becominng an manipulative invisible taxation system. Much better to use free producs: OpenOffice.org or any other."
__label__1,"Very disappointed!: I bought this CD with money I didn't have to spend only to have it leave me empty and with a slight headache! . I have meditated for a long time however on this CD I found his ah's and om's distracting to my own concentration. I guess I was hoping for more of a guided visualization although I understand the method behind the practice on this CD. The background music is splendid but I just found that I couldn't concentrate as well as I usually do while mediaiting. I just wish I could have listened to the CD before I wasted my money and my time. I still think Dr, Dyer is super though. I hope others fair better!"
__label__2,"!: I hold Jay Lee of Houston's KPFT and his repeated playings of ""The French Toast Man"" on the now-defunct 'Wake Up and Smell the Coffee' largely responsible for the dementia of many Houstonians now in their late twenties.This record is too surreal for most people; if you prefer more predictable, less random lyrics, you should pass. But, if you wish to propel yourself into a state of uninhibited lunacy, play this record first thing in the morning, every day, for three weeks. Your life is bound to change."
__label__1,spiral disappointment: This was so disappointing. Cheaply made and not what it appeared to me on site.
__label__2,"Changing the future: Within the first 5 minutes, you are drawn into the character lead by Nicholas Cage. He can see 2 minutes into the future and change it. Therefore he takes up magic and gambling, but the FBI notices his gift and force him into helping the nation. This is a great movie. A must have for my library."
__label__1,Buyer Beware: This series is ruined by the inclusion of a laugh track.......this interferes with the storylines.
__label__1,"Smells like alcohol & watered down!: I have to agree with the other negative reviews for this product. I have used biosilk for 15 years and this is not it! The bottled it watered down with alcohol. The sticker on the top of the bottle telling you to ""shake well"" so that you do not notice how watered down it is. I have never bought biosilk in the salon with a sticker on it telling you to ""shake well"" before use. So be aware you are not getting what you expect or pay for, and the alcohol will dry out your hair and make it smell bad!"
__label__2,"Phonex PX-441 Wireless Jack System used for DirecTv: This is the brand recommended by DirecTv if you don't have a telephone jack nearby to hook the DVR to (so you can order pay-per-view movies). Easy, quick installation. Does the job. Also about $30 less than equivalent item at Best Buy!"
__label__1,"Great for tiny laptops: Loved the backpack, but my Dell laptop (not a tiny one, granted) didn't fit. Would have loved to keep this backpack, but the sleeve was just too small. It might hold an IBM Thinkpad 600 or smaller, but my Dell wasn't even a close fit."
__label__2,Memories: This was a gift for my dad who served in Germany. He loved their music and his record was very scratched so he was thrilled with this.
__label__2,"excellent for a studio outing: perhaps best studio album...along with Shakedown, American Beauty and some say Anthem...maybe Workingmans comes close. Actually Touch of Grey is their truly best studio but that is a different era."
__label__1,"slippery slope: Good idea....but not tested enough..!the gripper tends to slide off typical sheathing products such asthe 4' x 8' ""Advantec"" & ""Grant"" products.These sheathings are fast becoming the standard for side wall sheathingand also roofs as well as sub floorsI do NOT recommend this product....money wasted..!"
__label__1,Boring....: I bought this movie for my 7th grade class because we were doing ledgends. They were bored out of their heads....
__label__2,"The Only Way to Use an Auto GPS: My daughter had one of these for her GPS and finally ordered one for myself and my wife's car. A safe way to put the GPS in easy view several places in any vehicle without taking your eyes off the road. Have used Garmin GPS's for years and struggled with car mounting...THIS is the answer. As always, ecom has great prices, no tax, good packaging and quick shipping. Buy one...you'll love it."
__label__1,".....not happy: Horrible. It was supposed to be durable enough for my husbands shoes, but within days the metal hooks bent and wouldn't stay on the door...."
__label__2,Great full coverage bra: I love this style and have bought it for years. I am a 34D and the coverage and lift is GREAT! No cleavage bulges or 'bumps' under a T-shirt -- which is so important for a smooth appearance!
__label__1,"Such a disappointment: It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary Cider House Rules. It felt to me like one long (in Irving fashion) rebuttal letter to his critics. This book was transparently Irving's forum for justifying, through character Ruth, his style and choices in past works. If you read the book, you'll understand. Yes, I believe a man can write from a woman's viewpoint. No, I don't believe Irving was able to pull it off in Widow. The book read like a Sidney Sheldon novel. The only difference is that (so far) it's not embarrassing to read a John Irving book on the bus. The story was entirely predictable, the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant. I was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite American authors."
__label__1,"Ordered DVD received VHS tape: I ordered a DVD tape and received a VHS tape. This makes it difficult to utilize for the class I am facilitating. It frustrated me so much I have not researched how to return it and have this error corrected. It would be great to get the DVD first and then I will return the VHS.Can you help me?Thank you,Magtcc"
__label__1,True Irish Ghost Stories: I really DId not like the book. The way it is written you do not know we're one story begins and the other ends.
__label__1,"not so good: I remember having this book read to me as a kid, our aging old granny of a teacher who was a dedicated feminist read it to us not once but twice during a single month. I must say as a male the ending I thought was offensive and uncalled for, and I remember being quite shoced with it at the time. What did the woodcutter do to deserve his punishment exactly? being handsome and mucular? being poor? trying to woo the princess and not fight her? he is sincere and kind and she just kicks the poor guys ass."
__label__1,"Story Sadly Lacking and Radcliff not convincing: I wanted to like this movie, but.... I feel Radcliff was a poor choice for the grieving widower. He seemed unemotional and unafraid which did nothing for the character in the movie. I loved him in the Harry Potter/Lord of the Ring movies. I think he could be a good actor but not in this part. The flashbacks to the character's lost wife should have brought a tear or two to his eye but nothing but a blank stare each time. The scenery was gloomy, the house pretty scary, the idea of the waters covering the road gave the house a creepy air of isolation. The scared villagers were somewhat interesting but weren't enough to make it a good movie. I love a good horror mystery but this was not as scary as advertised."
__label__2,"Delicious recipes: This cookbook is great, Makes it easy to create whole meals - many yummy deserts. Southern Living style meals with a twist, all the flavor while cutting calories and fat! I use recipes from this book every week. The cookbook is a ""must have"" for the health & weight conscious southern cook."
__label__1,"Lol...Filth: My absolute FAVORITE horror movie of ALL time is ""Night of the Living Dead""...The 1968, black/white, low budget version. I started watching the 1990 version 'Sci-Fi' one afternoon, and I didn't stop watching it until it was over...Why? It was hilarious...Plus they had a better zombie movie on afterwards, and I didn't have anything else to do until then... This movie is despicable compared to the original. From terrible dialogue to terrible themes, this movie is just TERRIBLE... If you haven't seen the 1968 version, with all enthusiasm from myself, please watch it a.s.a.p., but never subject yourself to the remake unless you're either punishing yourself, or you need a good laugh..."
__label__1,Terrible text book: This text book is terrible for beginning neurology. The definitions and explanations are incomplete and often confusing. The illustrations are unhelpful and also confusing. I would not recommend this book to anyone!
__label__1,"Once Was Enough: The Thin Red Line was very disappointing. It's not that good compared to a movie like Das Boot for example. The acting was fine, the battle scenes (of what little there were) were pretty good, and the cinematography was great, but everything else about this movie was quite bland. The movie should have been presented different. The voice-overs and dreamy sequences were irritating and the movie was too long and boring. Watch this at your own risk. Watch Das Boot instead; now that's a great movie."
__label__1,"Very rigid, poorly designed product: While ""Greeting Card Factory Deluxe"" may have plenty of graphics the program is not worth the $60 I shelled out for it. The program seems to be designed for people who just want to choose a project and print it. For example, trying to be creative with calendars is extremely difficult. Further, if you make a change on one month of the calendar (e.g. dragging the calendar days) it applies to all the months.Too rigid! Don't buy it! I'm going to try and get my money back!"
__label__2,"Get this for your child!: This is clear and easy to use reference book. It includes sentences using the words in context, helping with comprehension.As a child I loved to read and write, so at some point in my life my Mom introduced me to a Thesaurus. To this day it is one of my best friends. Thanks mom.There are adults who do not even know what a thesaurus is!Do your kids a favor and introduce them to a thesaurus!"
__label__1,"Not what I was wanting at all: I ordered this CD set wanting to get Barbershop quartet music. Unfortunately, that is not what I received. What I got was basically acapella jazz. Too much Manhattan Transfer, not enough real, boater hat, striped vest, toe tapping barbershop. Oh, a few of the selections were OK (at best), but most of them have very modern, jazzlike arrangements. I suppose this is the current state of ""barbershop quartet"" music. I am beginning to get the feeling that finding real, traditional Barbershop Quartet recordings is going to be difficult..."
__label__2,Field guide: loved this guide and plan on using it throughout the year. I love the clear colored pictures. They really help you recognize the plants so much better than sketches. Great information on every plant that it reviews. It is a small sized book for easy carrying. I great way to get information for plants in Eastern and Central United States.
__label__1,"So disappointed, so very disappointed: I laughed like a loon when I watched these shows as a kid. My sides hurt and tears came to my eyes. For years, I told people that that this was the best, most creative, funniest show ever aired. I tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but I never did. Suddenly, I found this collection on ecom and I was in heaven. When it arrived, I ripped it open and started to watch. I fell asleep before I got through the first episode. I was crushed. Nary a laugh or even a snicker on the DVD. Truly disappoined after decades of waiting. Sigh!"
__label__1,"Fire hazard: Like many others have written here, this oven has cheap controls that malfunction and can be dangerous. In my case, the oven would turn on by itself with no warning or lights. STAY AWAY from this and all Cuisinart ovens. They are cheaply made junk."
__label__2,"Sensual, delicious fun: Total's back with an even grittier sound! Wit help from Missy Elliot on the album, the trio are at their best: sexy, humorous, and sensual. Perhaps the best song on the cd is ""Do Something"", where Kima, Keisha and Pam ""recieve"" a phone call from their man's girlfriend, and a rumble is on!!! Pick up this cd, you'll enjoy it."
__label__2,"Great Bag!: I'm a 24 year old college student who was tired of carrying the traditional backpack. I was looking for a bag that would hold my books and at the same time be stylish. This bag can be used in both casual and professional settings. It is spacious and goes well with anything. There is a large compartment which can hold items such as books, folders, or a laptop. The larger compartment also has a smaller zipper compartment inside. The large front flap closes with velcro and when you lift it up there are two medium sized zipper compartments which can hold pens, music devices, small books, snacks, or other smaller items. The back of the bag has another compartment which closes with velcro. On the sides are two medium size compartments which snap closed and the shoulder strap is adjustable. The exterior of the bag is 100% cotton and the interior is 100% polyester. Overall I think anyone would be pleased with this bag."
__label__2,"My Daughter loves her new book.: I bought this book for my Daughter who learned to knit basic knit and pearl stuff from her Grandmother. I can't help her with anything when it comes to knitting, but this book has been wonderful for her. She found the basic directions very easy to follow. We will be purchasing the second book by this same author for her for Christmas."
__label__1,"cibi: this is not a good deviceit will not cover 360 degree anglei will not recomend this product to anybodywhen i gone for a long trip, one policeman detecting the speed with his gun in I-75, but i didnt get any signal from my detector. anyway i loose my money on it.dont buy these item, because you will defenitely waste your money."
__label__1,"An Embarrassment and a Waste of Time: I've had conversations with hand puppets that have been more stimulating. I love the PC-correct slaves ""our master pays us"" and the mute daughter ""Poppa!"" The scene where Gibosn makes the faulty chair while all the slaves and family watch thru the slats is truly sad. Ridiculous, redundant and reprehensible. Remember when Mel Gibson made good movies? Where have you gone Mad Max?"
__label__1,"Oh, please...: This book had a great plot! I had a hard time putting it down at first. But then I lost my interest as things started to detract from the story. Much of it seemed predictable, and then at the end there were too many coincidences. I really didn't care for it and also was disturbed by a completely unnecessary scene between a man and a woman. Not worth checking out at the library, much less purchasing."
__label__2,"....: I was very tolerant of these series, but they are really getting kind of boring. It was great that Max and Liz had their small moment together, but overall this book, these series really, is just not realistic, with all the ""aristocrats"" and all. But it makes for listless reading if you feel like reading. Well, I'm still looking forward to the next book."
__label__2,copper necklace: I needed a necklace to complete an outfit and wasn't having any luck finding one until I looked here! This necklace is beautiful! It matched my top so perfectly people have asked if they came as a set.
__label__1,"Waste of time...: With the sense of humor of a can of cat food, this book is a tedious look at all the archetypes of contemporary life. Everybody's cardboard. By the time you hit page 30, you don't give a damn about anyone, you start hoping that an asteroid will somehow make an appearance and end the whole thing.I read allusions and comparisons to Hiassen and Wodehouse. I'm forced to wonder if those making such citations have actually ever read those writers... based on the evidence of this dog, I think not.Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. Even stranded on a desert island, this book would be put to better use in starting fires or at the latrine."
__label__2,great book and excellent topics: the book is great i had to read it for young adult literature and i enjoyed it. great book for intermediate and high school students
__label__1,"Not worth it: I found the book to be cute at first, but it just keeps on piling up the fiction references. Imagine a world where everything fiction in our world existed, that's what this book is.Cute to begin with, but ultimately boring."
__label__2,Escape(?) to Poland?: This was a compelling read once I got into it. I found the description of life in Poland at that time period fascinating.
__label__2,"More music than theater: Here another thought of the endless Solti vs HvK debate: Solti offers theater, Karajan focuses on the music.And in my opinion, it is the MUSIC that makes Wagner the genius that he is, not the story. Feel free to disagree, but I can find no comparable satisfaction than hearing the majestic Berlin Philharmonic of the late 1960s in all their shine and glory on forteen CDs from the first Rheingold- to the last Goetterdaemmerung notes. There is nothing like it; I don't know any orchestra that offers the same sonority, beauty and eventually authority in playing Wagner than the Berlin Phil during the golden HvK days. Not even the Wiener come close.The engineering is excellent, and the details of the fabric of the Wagnerian sound ideals are celebrated in every detailed note.If you prefer music to theater, this is the one."

__label__1,good stoves but terrible pumps: MSR has always made great lightweight stoves but have made terrible pumps. I have been through three generations of pumps. The first generation came apart on a winter trip scattered fuel everywhere and set the snow on fire. Tabs holding the pump handle broke off. The second generation also breaks tabs but at least it didn't set me on fire. It also simmered well. The third generation (shown here) switched to a rubber cup instead of leather so it siezes in hot desert weather. You have to oil it often. The check valves fail easily. It will not simmer. Nor does it turn off properly leaving the stove burning at a low level. You have to blow it out to be sure. It also has weak plastic threads that strip easy. It no longer has an O ring on the bottle so it will eventually leak in your pack. The second generation pump was the best of a bad lot but this new one is worthless.
__label__2,"An excellent show!: This is way up there on the list of my all time favorite tv shows. Unfortunately it only aired for one year before being canceled. Brisco County Jr. offers a little something for everyone, it's kind of a sci-fi western. In the episodes you'll find action, adventure, romance, comedy, and more. The first few episodes are the best, but others they got a little cheesy with. If you are familiar with Bruce Campbell's character in Army of Darkness, Brisco County Jr. gives the same kind of witty one liners."
__label__1,"Soooooo disappointed: I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were , basically, thrown out when this movie was made. I was so disappointed. I will not watch this sequel again. If you really liked the first two movies, I would not bother to watch the 3rd. It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line."
__label__2,"Great bird guide addition: I think this book is a great book for birders. It helped me learn birds by where I was (habitat), where in the past I had no real way of having core knowledge to build on for what birds I would see based on what type of habitat I was in (I'm not an expert birder). I've never seen another field guide done this way and I think it's a great way to catagorize birds.The pictures are great and the stories along with the identification info make this book a good read. I really enjoyed the Raven and Wolf story.I recommend birders add this book to their collection."
__label__1,"Very Short, General Document: The document is only 3 short overview paragraphs, there isn't any information here that can't be found for free online. I thought any document is worth $1.50, not this one - save your money."
__label__1,"What happened?: Back in the '80s when the heavy metal well was running dry it just seemed like the Crue was just your average glam band. They started out so strong with thier first two albums but then just seemed to fall into the category of ordinary. They finally broke out of that, but at the expense of breaking up the band (it just ain't the Crue without all four members). Then the Crue was back, and I just so happened to come across Generation Swine in the used CD bin. So I figured ""what the heck"" and bought it. To my dismay, it was actually original, innovative, and by far the Crue's best. You could tell that they put a lot of effort into the album. Now, much like their fellow metal brethren, Dokken, the Crue has slithered back into mediocrity, content to sell the masses the same old schlok that they produced in the '80s. How very disappointing."
__label__2,"ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR ANY SILVER COLLECTOR: All of the Dorothy Rainwater silver books are abosolutes musts for any serious sterling silver collector of American silver, or any antique dealers who deal in silver. Or anyone now buying silver for meltdown. It will help you sort from the ordinary silver to the silver that could be worth far more than per ounce than melt down. It is the reference. Fairly logical in its layout, though I would have liked more cross-listing between companies that were bought by other companies. Still, if you are at all serious about sterling collecting, this is a must have."

I purchased a replacement and meticulously set it up per instructions. The LAN part worked OK and after an hour of putsing the wireless sprang into life - for a while. Now none of the household laptops can connect by wireless, including the unit I first succeeded in connecting. Power-off-resets of everyting in the building, re-configuration of the laptops and resetting the Belkin router have proven fruitless. I'm resigned to having a wired household until we can locate a product that operates better than this. The Belkin wireless G is in the garbage with a boot print on it. Adios."
__label__1,"Kindle Edition Diagrams Unreadable: This one star review is strictly a review of the terrible kindle version. The images, figures, diagrams or basically anything that is not text is such low resolution that it is unreadable. The legibility of the diagrams is absolutely necessary for such a book to be useful. The diagrams in the kindle edition are not legible. Why even offer a kindle edition if it's this bad? Now I have to figure out how to get my $40 back and I still don't have the reference book that I need."

__label__1,"Laying on a guilt trip: I didn't read this book to my daughter when she was a child, but someone gave it to her for her new baby. When I read it, it was all I could do not to take it away and hope that no one would miss it, because I don't want my granddaughter to have this story! It is just too sad, and little children should not be reading sad stories. Yes, it is a meaningful parable, but tiny children don't need meaningful parables. They should have joy, not deep thoughts.The mothers who love it probably have a secret martyr complex. When I read the review quoting the mother who said the tree is ""all mothers"" I thought this is someone who is laying the foundation for a major guilt trip later in life. The boy is selfish and never does appreciate the tree, and that's OK with the tree. But I'll bet that mother is someone who will tell her grown child ""look at all I did for you, and you don't appreciate me."""
__label__1,"Boring: I watched the 2 mini series when they were on TV long time ago. I loved the 2 shows. So, I bought this set thinking what a great deal to have 2 mini series with a great price. I was so wrong.It turns out that this set is actually a regular TV show that was made after the two mini series. I don't even know they made another TV series. Nope. Never heard of this.I guess they ran out of budget. The episodes are slow and boring. The performance from the actors are good but the story seem rushed out from the writer. I can even see the couple of film crews and the cameraman wearing a T-shirt from the reflection. LOL. They definitely ran out of money. After watching the first 4 or 5 episodes, I have to let it go. Can't watch this series anymore. Too boring.2 stars."

Read it now, and just as his Fast Food Nation took us on a startling journey of discovery about the meat-packing industry and the sick world of fast food, this book will open your eyes and possibly change the manner in which you proceed with your life. He speaks to the heart of issues. He exposes the big lies. Schlosser has a great deal to say on topics of critical interest to millions of Americans. Read, learn, and act accordingly."
__label__2,"Stunning fourth movement: I am giving this one four stars rather than five because the sound quality is a little disappointing and overall I still prefer the Klemperer recording. That said, the 4th movement in this recording is one of the most moving and spectacular things I've ever heard come out of my speakers. As others have noted, the brass section is especially to be commended. If for no other reason, buy this one for the 4th movement. And get the tissues ready."
__label__1,The boys don't like them: I bought these in hopes that our boys would love them. They can't stand them. I think if they were old enough to swallow them whole they would be fine but once they chewed them they started gagging. I think the product is great but the delivery is difficult unless your child likes to swallow whole.
__label__2,"A Complete Guide To Float Hunting Alaska: I was fortunate enough to meet Larry at a book signing recently. He gave a slide presentation which included many photos of his hunting experiences. The photos and advice shared that evening were enough to motivate me to buy and read his book. Once complete, I was chomping at the bit to get on an Alaskan river. The book's resources are endless, as are the maps and details of where to go and how to get there. His knowledge of Alaska's rivers and animals certainly makes him ""the"" hunter to write this kind of book. Wow!"

I hate to say anything negative about this VERY talented band, but this is the worst CD I've purchased in many years. After having heard it one time, I nearly chucked it out the window of my car onto the highway. The only thing that prevented me from doing that was the law against littering, and this certainly qualified as trash. But, hey, if you like really slow boring songs that sound like they were written 50 years ago, and so tuneless that not even Jennifer Charles' magnificent voice could bring them to life for more than a tenth of a second at a time, then..."

It's not a bit scary; I watched it with a six-year-old and she was delighted with it to the point of dancing around the room and singing.Although this movie had absolutely no plot it was wonderful comic relief, the music was the kind that makes you want to act like a six-year-old ;) and the gremlins were so cute!

__label__1,"Horrendous movie: Tiger Love (aka Legend of the Tiger) stars Stephen Tung as a young man raised in the jungle by his mother and a tiger. It is terrible with weak choreography and a ridiculous story. Don't be fooled, Lo Lieh only appears for about 10 minutes of the movie. To make matters worse, it goes from a poor martial arts flick and morphs into an awful ghost story with a marauding tiger determined to take revenge on people that killed his master. Avoid at all costs."

__label__2,"Almost 4 year old really enjoying this so far...: I bought my almost 4 year old the leapster after returning the V-tech V-smile (see my review of the V-smile for more info).I am really pleased with it so far. Graphics are good, the stylus pen it comes with is easy to use, and the games seem much more educational than the V-smile ones. My only real complaint is that the colors on the screen are sometimes hard to distinguish, but maybe I need to see it with 3 year old eyes. Anyway, so far so good, seems to be worth the $$ I shelled out for it. I also like the portability of this thing-it will make long car rides a bit more pleasant for everyone I hope."
__label__2,"Hilarious movie with good storyline: Tom Green is probably the funniest person of the later 2000 decade in my opinion. This movie isn't as obnoxious as his stunts, it is him playing a funny movie. It does have a few slapstick moments like The Tom Green Show, but it isn't that bad. It is a very funny movie and I recommend it."

__label__2,"Good Quality, But One Design Fault: This power bar is pretty good, but loses a star from me because of plug orientation:Pros:- good quality- nice mounting hardware included- lots of plugsCons:- Orientation of the plugs is wrong. It is such that your AC adapters will interfere with the next plug. Many people will buy this device to plug in a lot of wall wart power units, and they can get in each other's way. I would rather the plugs were rotated 90 degrees so that I could use ever outlet on the bar.Obviously the reason to get such a big bar is to have enough space to put the wall warts, otherwise we would buy one of the much more commonly available smaller units. This one doesn't quite solve the problem. Still an improvement. The only brand I have seen that have the correct outlet orientation are Prime 12 Outlet Power Strips, but they are poorly reviewed."

I plugged this bad boy into it and presto, 7 new usb ports. You aren't even required to plug it in with the included AC adapter. If all you're using are 1-2 flash drives, then the unit receives adequate power from your computer's usb port. If you intend to connect multiple items such as usb powered external hard drives, then you will have to plug in the AC power as well. I haven't had any issues with this product. There are so many ports I no longer have to unplug some devices to make room for others, as there is room for all. No problems with my different drives un-mounting when my computer goes to sleep, unlike some other popular usb hubs. I wouldn't recommend using this to connect a USB wireless network adapter. It seems to me that connecting it, and multiple other devices through a single port would affect internet performance."

The bone is healing slowly and not sure if the digestive enzymes are helping or not, but I definitely have more energy and less pain, so I'm saying it is helping. I have never had any problems with digestion, but I've read that the efficiency of our digestive systems decrease as we get older, so using these enzymes probably improves health as you get older."

__label__1,"I agree with Colonel Bourgeois! Terrible piracy!: I will NOT purchase this item! Altissimo should not receive money from official recordings of the Marine Band! God bless you for your many years of high-quality music making Colonel Bourgeois ... is the Marine Band pursuing legal action against these pirates? As a university professor/Director of Bands for 35 years, I have acquired dozens of recordings of ""The President's Own,"" and I am appalled at the audacity of this shoddy outfit that simply ""cuts and pastes"" official recordings together to make a profit. But...doesn't the same thing also happen on iTunes with our other military bands? Unethical people are making money from these recordings! They are specifically issued to be distributed by The Marine Band (or any of the other world-class military musical organizations)--not for profit! Let's get the lawyers involved and shut these guys down!"
__label__1,"Top Heavy: This model boat is extremely powerful. While that made - note my use of the past tense here - for fun straight line acceleration, the boat would heel over dramatically during turns. On the fifth or sixth turn, even under reduced power, the thing heeled over and sank in less than 30 seconds. It's a complete waste of money."
__label__1,"Books are too expensive: I do not own a kindle. I have no TV and I read 200+ books every year. I love gadgets. Why don't I own a kindle? Because the books are too expensive. These books do not need print production, printing presses, binderies or (most expensively) distribution. Why do they cost more than most paperbacks? Take a lesson from iTunes and make the books less expensive."
__label__2,"EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE, GREAT GUIDE!!!: We are still in the early stages of PROTOCEL, so it would be too soon for me to speak on the progress of the Cancer patient at hand. I can however say, I have learnt so much through Tanya's book, it has been so insightful and I have so much faith in her words, that we have the entire family on a new lifestyle plan, with regard to preventing Cancer. I have already bought four copies, for different members of my family and friends. Her findings put life into perspective and make you realise what the pharmaceutical company's are really all about! An eye opener and a must read for everyone, even if you do not suffer from Cancer. I am grateful for other's reviews, because it was thanks to those, that I was drawn to this book. If you decide to do something good for yourself, for your health, for the people you love, read Outsmart Your Cancer!!!!"
__label__1,"Stay away from these! Poor design!: Hanes has definitely changed their 'fit' profile. These boxer briefs are made in a way that they fit so awkward that I refuse to wear them anymore. I'm going to look for a new brand.As others have stated, the crotch hangs way down, offering no support, unless you pull them up to your belly button. In addition, the legs are too tight around the thighs.Steer clear of these! You will be disappointed."
__label__1,"Good, but 06 is free.: don't waste your money. the 2006 version is availible for free download at sportsmogul.com yeah, no reason to buy this. greatly addicting!"
__label__2,"Great reception, great looks.: This unit tunes in the fm channels excellently, but the way the tuner looks on the Nano screen is what I like the best. It looks just like a digital tuner, and also has the ability to preset five or more channels, just like on your car radio. I don't like the headphones that it comes with. While they sound fine, they are the hard plugs typical to the IPOD standards. I like the flexible soft sided headphones. The tuner does allow the use of other headphones, so no problem there."
__label__2,"Excellent Resource/Tooth Trauma: This text is an excellent resource for any dentist to have in their office -- should be required for all dental students!! Each page is full of detailed color diagrams and color photos. Topics covered include crown fracture, crown-root fracture, root fracture, concussion and subluxation, extrusive and lateral luxation, intrusive luxation, avulsioin, supporting structures, and trauma to primary dentition. Each case has supporting description, exam and diagnosis, and treatment plan/procedures outlined. Quintessence Books has been a primary resource for my dental library. This text is a valuable addition."

__label__2,Exciting plot: This was one of the first books my daughter read cover-to-cover in one sitting. She was very interested in the outcome of the race and motivated to finish the book. Some of the vocabulary is specific to ballooning and was unfamiliar even to me (at least in the context of ballooning).
__label__1,"Too many surprises: I agree with others the Brother Technical Support is virtually nonexisting. My MFC8440 works great as a printer and dedicated fax. It does not work with TAD the same way as my previous MFC8300 (the best machine I ever had). This is the first great disappointment because setting does not allow change that. PC fax works properly as well. However, PC fax software can not be used by serious business user. It is very limited. Total disappointment is the scanner. Software can not find it. I tried all possible connections: direct printer port, direct USB, network. Tech support lady told me the only version equipped with optional Brother network card will allow me to use scanner. I did not buy it. Summarizing: you can get better product from other manufacturers."
__label__2,"LOVE CHI shampoo!: This shampoo is great! It makes my frizzy hair so much more manageable. It helps to take the frizzies away. The only tiny complaint I have about it is that I have to use a ton just to get it to lather up. I guess the ingredients are just not lather-rich, so no big deal."
__label__2,"Excellent!: This book is a must-read for any archaeology student. I agree with other reviewers that the title is somewhat misleading, however the author uses the site of Sipan only as a case study. He includes information about many other sites and legal cases as they fit in with topics covered in the case study. The best part of this book is that the author actually offers plausible suggestions for solving the problem, not just complaining about it. I am, of course, against tomb robbing, but I also value the material available in museums. I recomend that readers also look into the museum and collector's positions in order to form your own opinion. This book is very persuasive (especially the photos), but I would still try to keep an open mind."
__label__1,"the worst album by one of the greatest indie rock bands: A lot of fans feared this was their last album, because the energy and inspiration just didn't come through on the recording. There are many good songs, but, unfortunately, there are also a few bad ones (""Trephination"" for example, which seems to go nowhere). Maybe having ""a few"" bad songs doesn't seem like a big deal, but this came from a band whose every album was a monster of sound and energy! What happened? Maybe Duane (the guitarist) has too many side projects, because his tone is weak and the playing is uninspired. If you're looking to buy your first Jesus Lizard, buy Head or Goat instead."
__label__2,"Aqua Bassino - Deeper: Such an improvement from the first EP. Deeper is just that -- better production, jazzier melodies, deeper bass. Aqua Bassino's best known track, ""Milano Bossa,"" appears here, but there's no reason any of these tracks shouldn't appear on just as many compilations. ""Na Na's Waltz"" is a musical scotch on the rocks, ""Aqua"" kicks things up a notch, and ""Welcome Home (Live Mix)"" cinches the deal with a great trumpet line by Colin Steele."
__label__1,"Hummm... Not too much: I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with ""mi tierra"". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best."
__label__2,"Mindless Action No Way!!: Progressively Awesome. If you like mindless action, this game is not for you. This game is about puzzles and challenges. My kids absolutely love this game. The game starts out on a learning level and advances to amazing. This game will give the whole family a challenge. This is an action adventure puzzle game to say the least. The graphics are great! The little movies between the levels are the funniest ever! The wittiness of this game is awesome.I would challenge people everywhere to see if they could solve this game. If you quit after 3-4 levels, you don't know what you are missing because this game gets better and better!!!!Gameplay 8.5Graphics 9.5Replayability 8Fun for all ages 10"
__label__2,"Music for the rock lovers: I admit I found out about Pray for the Soul of Betty via Constantine Maroulis on American Idol. I purchased the Explicit lyrics CD here on ecom and am still waiting for it to arrive. However, I do own the homemade CD that I bought off their website. I like it. I think their sound is unique to the world of rock music and I give the band kudos to being independant of a major studio to produce their album, which speaks volumes about their music integrity, drive and determination. I think this band's music is raw, unique and worthy to be in any rock lover's CD collection. Each song grew on me. I like each song individually for the stories that they tell. My favorite songs are Cut the Cord, Cry, Drift and The Day. I highly recommend this CD be bought by someone who appreciates rock music on that indie spirit level. I'm a fan of this band and will buy their future CD's."
__label__2,"Very useful keys: I have used this book in numerous fish surveys in Michigan, and have found the keys to be extremely useful, easy to use, and well illustrated. It and Scott & Crossman's ""Freshwater Fishes of Canada"" are almost the only fish ID books I use. A caveat - its broad geographic scope makes it less useful than regional keys, if they exist for your area."
__label__2,"Highest quality CD: I would rate this recording of Taiko music among my most favorite CDs. Incidentally, my collection ranges from Bluegrass & Celtic to Mozart and Ani Difranco. Ibuki is a release which fully captures the amazing energy of Kodo, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an eclectic taste in music. It is so clear that these musicians are tops in their genre."
__label__2,mnade a difference: Made a huge difference. Adding RAM is the least expensive way to upgrade an older machine.
__label__2,"I really liked this story: I have read another of Rhyannon Byrd's books and loved it. This one was just as wonderful. You can feel the chemistry between the two characters and the heat. If you liked ""Against the Wall"" then you will like this story as well. This was another one that I could not put down until I finished it. Definitely give this one a chance."
__label__2,"Works as advertised: Had an old Dell laptop that needed WiFi connection, and this item was the answer. Installed easily and works well."
__label__1,"Disappointed: Considering the cast, I was disappointed in the simplistic approach to what could have been a very thought provoking vehicle for conversation. Mother/daughter conflict...please give me something that can help me navigate that divide."
__label__2,"good cd!: Where is get wild which cd is that on?is it even on a cd? but anyway this is a great cd , better than greeting by like 2 points so not much!which is also a great album 2,i took 1 star off because i think heroine is very annoying."
__label__2,"Beautiful RPG: I really enjoyed this game, and it's the first I've played to the end in a long time. The storyline is fascinating, the graphics are stunning, and the fighting styles are beautiful to watch. It's not as open-ended as Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, but I thought it was much more entertaining to play."
__label__1,"Very Disappointed: These bins were not the size they were advertised to be, and worst of all was their horrible smell. Absolutely terrible, even after I left them to air out for a bit. It was so bad that I had to return them right away. I am not sure if this is the way the product is supposed to be, or they sent me rotten ones. I definitely do not recommend these."
__label__1,"Put stones around your house for the ultimate in harmony!: Now, I can get into some feng shui and I can see how a certain flow to your house is important. I can accept things like ""don't put your bed on the same wall as the door"", but that is a far cry from this book. Putting different color rocks in different places around the house will not help you and you might want to take a trip to the shrink if you think otherwise. If you still believe in the power of rocks--LOL--after you get back from the shrink, then this is the book for you! Buy it now!"
__label__1,"OK if you ignore the FM abilities: I bought this player mainly for its FM recording abilities. I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library. So for under $100 i thought this would be great for what i needed. I was wrong. When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum. This also travels over to recording. You can leave the backlight on all the time, but that will just eat power like no tommorow. Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had. Dont by it for FM anything! Get a Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus like I did - cheaper & it works!"
__label__1,Didn't last long because the amp blew.: My son loved making lots of noise on this guitar but the amp no longer works after only a few months and now he can't use it all. I would not recommend this product.
__label__1,"Will not fit a 1996 Dakota: I searched for a 1996 Dakota. This is the part that ecom suggested. This part fits 1997-2003 Dodge Dakotas and Durangos with 3.9L V6 or 5.2L Magnum V8. Unfortunately, this type of filter system does not fit any normal 1996 Dakota setup. Beware of the ecom parts search engine."
__label__1,"dull, dull, dull...: Quck continues her trend of writing increasingly worse books. The story is incredibly dull...there's no action, just plenty of dull non-sparkling dialogue and boring characters. I don't understand how her writing has weakened so from her first enjoyable books (scandal, surrender, etc.). The ending is such that I'm sure we'll endure another story about the March/Lake investigative team."
__label__2,"One great story by two great writers: Danziger and Martin are both successful writers because of their two very distinctive and different writing styles. Their ""voices"" complement one another beautifully in this story of friendship and life changes. The problems facing the main characters, Tara*Star and Elizabeth are ones that young readers will relate to---as well as the personal growth the girls experience as they tackle their challenges. The story is told with endearing honesty and humor. A very enjoyable 'read'!"
__label__2,"Great!!: This CD is AMAZING. I received in my mailbox, ripped it from it's package, and popped it into my CD Player, as always with a new CD, not expecting anything new. But Halfaworldaway is truly unique, and totally enjoyable! The songs range from upbeat to ballads, and are soothing, relaxing. They help me to clear my mind. I love this CD! I totally recommend it to everyone!"
__label__1,"Not the best Bodum press: I needed a new Bodum press after my last one broke, and thought this would be good one since it seemed to be more durable than the others, with plastic encasing around the glass insert. Ironically, I ended up breaking the glass insert because it always gets stuck within the plastic encasing, and then the rubber edges start to roll down, etc. If you rinse the press, water becomes trapped between the encasing and the glass insert, never drying fully unless you remove the glass insert, and also dripping into the coffee when pouring. I will buy another Bodum press, but probably one with the metal encasing vs. rubber or plastic."
__label__1,"Poor Quality Cover: When I bought this cover, I thought it would be as rough and tumble as what the G.I.'s get. I was 100% wrong. I took my canteen and cover on a camping trip this summer thinking it was a great idea for hiking. But I was wrong. I bought 3 of these for three canteens, and they all had the same problems. The cover rips when you try to pull a snap open. The Velcro pocket won't stay shut (I lost 2 bottles of Iodine Tablets that way). Also, the accompanied military style belt clips are so stiff that you need another person to help you put it on. Then it falls off! The stiff clips will easily pop off. I suggest you just get a caribener clip and a BPA free Nalgene Bottle. Don't waste your time with this."
__label__1,"Skip this double disc and get the Re-Mastered version.: This double cd has a number of great performances, unfortunately the sound on the 2 disc set is wretched. In order to do the Great Gonzo justice, pick up the remasted version (on one Disc no less) from Rockcandy records. You will not be disapointed!"
__label__1,What a shame!: The marketing people released this without ever listening to it. The prologue sounds more like a tedious prayer recited at church than a rousing good tale that grips you and doesn't let you go. God awful performance and it just may be the director's fault. If only someone had thought to read with feeling rather than recite an epic. Too bad! Maybe they'll release a version that the book deserves. This one is for the dustbin.
__label__1,"Very poor quality book . . . .: I breed fancy mice for a hobby, and bought this book as part of my mouse book collection. It is, by far, the poorest book ever written for the mouse owner. It just has the bare basics for mouse care, and sometimes not even that. Anyone just getting a mouse for a pet will be a little confused by this book, and I was ( and I have experience with mice!) In short, there are other books out there that are better! Don't waste your money."
__label__2,"The Thief of Always: The Thief of Always allows the reader to join Harvey Swick on his journey into Mr. Hood's Holiday House. Where every childhood wish is reality, and every day is perpetual fun.

Clive Barker shares his exquisite take on the age old societal warning: Be Careful What You Wish For.... A Must Read!!!!"
__label__1,"Not satisfied with quality of Dingo Treats: These treats are normally chewy, but the product I received was hard as a rock. I called the manufacturer (Dingo) to decipher the expiration code. They said the product I received was just about to cross over the expiration date. My dog still eats them, but not before he gives it a little snub."
__label__2,"The most amazing crime novel this decade: Vikram Chandra has written a book that instantly captivates you. It draws you into a world you did not know existed and then explains every facet of it. The heat and dust and food flavors of Bombay (or Mumbai) come alive in a vivid and compelling narrative. The book has two major characters, a weary police inspector and the crime lord who he pursues. I have read the book three times over the last two years and keep finding new pleasures in it. Vikram Chandra is a genius. His writing has Dickensian detail and heft, and yet moves as fast as any contemporary thriller."
__label__2,"Best battery for electronics: Batteries last a long time. I use them in my DSLR camera for shooting HD video and very high resolution pics. Even with flash use, the charge lasts for a loooong time. And most importantly, I can always count on my spare set to be ready for use, since they don't lose the charge that quickly when stored."
__label__2,Life changing book: Fearless Living is truly a life changing book. Rhonda give practical advice on how you can change your life! By using the wheel of fear I was able to recognize my own areas of fear and learn how to turn my fear into the wheel of freedom. The book has a workbook style that you can fill out as you go! Everyone should buy this book! Rhonda is great and fearless living is the way to go! Live Fearlessly!

__label__1,"Does not fit Senseo!: I was disappointed to find it does not fit my machine. The pods are very densely packed, I can't say how they would work in another machine but they are hard as a rock, maybe that is normal for the other units."
__label__2,fun book: This a fun book of poems and rhymes. Also check out the Tao translated by the same author - Stephen Mitchell.
__label__2,AWESOME: Love the music from start to finish!! Listen with my Daughter who sang some of these songs in high school productions!
__label__1,Shedding Light on The Book The City of Ember: The City of Ember's plot is there is a girl named LIna. She is discovering that the city is running low on supplies. Lina is always dreaming of a new city that is ten times better. The city is also underground and is only light by lights that go on and off at certain times. Lina really wants to leave the city. I liked that there was alot of characters. It was fun because you could see who did what. I disliked that there wasn't enough action. This book is just as good as The People of Sparks. It is really interesting because its like The City of Ember.
__label__2,LOVE my new hair dryer: I absolutely love this hair dryer. Yes as per other reviews it is heavier but it is so fast that I don't have to hold it long so I don't care. It dries my hair in a few minutes and leaves it so soft and straight with absolutely no frizz. I feel like I had it done at a salon. I am very very happy with this purchase.
__label__1,"You Eat Like This: Steven Levitt returns, this time with a book about the discipline of getting freaky, aka, freakonomics. I wish that Steve Levitt had had a chance to consult with the late, great Rick James regarding the subject matter of this book. I believe Rick James knew a thing or two about getting freaky...just give the guy a bag of coke and he was ready to PAR-TAY.Many of Levitt's assertions fall flat. In fact, one might say that they fall Levitt. Because one look at him and its obvious; the guy doesn't know the FIRST THING about getting freaky..."
__label__1,"Cheap: This mouse broke after 1 year. It just stopped working completely. No explanation. Otherwise, I felt like the wireless signal was too weak."
__label__1,"If you're looking for the Hulk...LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!!: Even at only $10, this is not worth the money.Mainly because I bought this expecting a Hulk comic.Didn't realize he is now only Bruce Banner with Hulk powers.Only the Cover panels contained pictures of the Green Monster called the Hulk, the rest was a MAJOR disappointment!The 3D effects were ok, but only containing two small CD's, and only two 3D comics, not worth more than $3."
__label__2,"An Eighties Classic: I was raised on Conan and Red Sonja, so I can't help but highly recommend these movies. No, the acting isn't great, and there are homosexual connotations that I just didn't catch when I was six, but these movies have stood the test of time-- at least in my estimation. Wonderful adventures with unforgetable characters, and the swords are just darn cool."
__label__2,"Engrossing, tightly written, detailed, effective and cheap!: I discovered this gem in the late 1970s when I was in my 20s -- a collaboration between basketball star Jerry Lucas and memory expert Harry Lorayne. As a history buff, I immediately put its succinctly described systems to use memorizing a complete list of Roman emperors and other trivia for fun. Later, when my language learning hobby heated up, I used a different technique to quickly remember foreign vocabulary. To this day, I regularly use still another system to recall hotel room numbers and other significant figures. As a mnemonicist, Lorayne was a showman. He made of habit of allowing himself to be personally introduced to everyone in an organization he was about to speak to -- a process that sometimes lasted well over an hour. Once on the platform, after his presentation, he would then recall the name of each person in the audience.The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School, and at Play"
__label__1,"Great while it lasted...: I loved this bag for the few weeks it lasted. The shoulder strap is attached to the bag really flimsily, though, so it didn't take long for it to break. Now it sits in my closet. I wish it had been more durable."
__label__1,Women's Watch: I bought this watch for my wife as a gift. When I got it I opened it to see what it looked like before I gave it to her. I'm glad I did. This watch is BIG for a women's watch. Even if you took all the links off and you got it to fit a womens wrist the dial and face size was more of a mans size. It's about the size of a Omega Seamaster.I returned it right away. If there is a guy out there that likes pink watches this is the watch for you!
__label__1,not recommended: I have been a programmer for over 30 years. Never before have I seen so many pages taken to convey so little useful information.

__label__2,"BLAZING!!!: Wow! This horn driven band has really done it with this new release. When I put it in the player, it practically melted. Their music found its way into my bloodstream...an addicting, infectious groove to say the least. Do yourself a favor...check out the sound samples online...you'll be convinced....Foxtrot is for real."
__label__2,"read One Hundred Years of Solitude instead: Ellende's use of magical realism makes this book a unique window through which one can learn about a certain period of Chillean history. Although the book is a joy to read on the whole, the traslation to English was lacking at times. In stead, I suggest a similar but much more brilliant work: Garcia's One hundred Years of Solitude."
__label__2,"awesome unit: This product is great, no need for batteries and gives a substantial radio broadcast, and is a must have for anyone who experiences power outages."
__label__1,poor new design: I purchased this to replace our older one. We have the same mat but was stained from red sauce. This new mat has different suction cups that do not work. So it fails to stay put.
__label__1,"Not for moles.: Used this product just as directed on several moles, not even the slightest improvement. Maybe it works on warts and spots , but not moles."
__label__2,Well worth the wait: This third installment in Sara Donati's Bonner series was well worth the wait. I had almost forgotten how much I enjoy the Bonner's and Sara's wonderful writing style. She has given us some great new characters and brought back some of our favorites....Curiosity is one of my favorite supporting characters. I highly recommend the entire series to anyone who has yet to try these wonderfully written historical novels. You will not be disappointed.

__label__2,"Great for guitar but made for bass!: This is a bass amp and is all digital. The back has an mp3 input, a mic cord output to hook it up to a pa system(with a GND LIFT button), 1/4 in headphone jack and also a spot for a foot pedal. The front has a passive input and a active input. You can have this amp set up to 5 pre sets which nice(4 with the buttons then 1 without)Just had to mess with it to get the effects to sound good but the fx are very diverse."

__label__2,"Quality switch that works well: This switch was my third try to find a DVI + USB KVM switch that worked. This was the charm. I use this with a Dell 2001FP running 1600x1200, with a laptop and desktop running ATI chipsets. Out of the box this switch worked quite well. Build quality is very good, if a bit bulky.I did notice one problem with something, which I eventually traced. If the desktop PC went into monitor powersave mode, while switched to the laptop, the screen would lose sync. Disabling the powersaving on the PC solved the problem. Avocent tech support was helpful in logging the report. I got a live person to talk to!The best feature is the keyboard hotkey switching. It allows you to place the switch just about anywhere and use the keyboard. The KVM has several extra USB 2.0 ports that can be statically assigned or switched. A good product that has really worked for me. I would recommend this for someone with a high rez DVI monitor that wants the quality of a digital input."
__label__1,Girls Gone Wild: Had some creative potential but failed miserably to deliver.Really bad acting skills; cheap production sets and props; storyline that seemed to just go nowhere - in fact it was just a jumbled editing mess.Definitely a let's-get-drunk sophomoric high school guy flick.
__label__1,"Watch Out!: I don't dispute that Bose is a leader in speaker technology. But there is a reason this item is discontinued. It locks up when playing certain DVDs. Sometimes after selecting ""play movie"" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen.Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say ""Bad Disc"" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing. You have to UNPLUG it and essentially reboot the system.Maybe I got the lemon, I don't know. But it's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name Bose... this system is definitely an exception to that rule."
__label__2,"nicely done: another well done piece of literary work from Mr. Follett. The plot can be geussed at some points, but it remained a good, thorough, page turner."

When Fanny's sister Rosanna decides to run off with one of tha enemys sons and have a baby, that is when the killings start. When Rosanna runs off with one of the hatfeilds sons {Jhonse} and whent ehy try to get marriedDuing this they ask for Devil Anse approval and he says no. After that Roseanna finds out that she is pregnant. Then the killings start. First it was Pharmer, Bud, and Tolbert. Then comes Afliar and Calvin. And last Roseanna. I am not going to tell you how all of this happens, but i will tell you that this is the best suspense story that i have ever read and if you are looking for a thriller you have come to the champ."
__label__2,"It is about time this solid sparkly gem got 5 stars!: I do not claim to know exactly how outrageously lame these past reviewers are, but if their miserable review efforts are of any indication... One can only assume they (the past critics) are gigantically dull-minded losers. 10 ft. is already a legend among reggae bands, and they continue putting out great stuff at an amazing rate. This release is no exception to the rule, it is absolutely 5 stars! no less! Buy it if you know what is good for you and listen to every crucial detail of the wonderful 10 ft. reggae vibes in circulation!"
__label__2,"A primer on Enjoying Life: Mr. Burg freely credits the information that he has gotten from others and adds real life experiances in making it work in such a manner that it actually makes sense and is very workable for the average person.I have tried to incorporate these gems into my own life with extraordinary results. In addition to the day-to-day successes in dealing with airport security people, hotel reservationists, stewardesses and other service people, I have found my clients, my suppliers and my friends all responding much more willingly to my requests than ever before. This has made my already fabulous life even more enjoyable. If you like people and want them to like you then you need the information in this book!You will already know much of it, but you will find it tied together in a nice package that makes a lot of sense. I have read it twice so far and given many copies of it to my friends, all of whom have thanked me."
__label__2,Swiss knife: My husband loves these knives. He will only use this one kind. The order was also shipped very fast. It is a really good buy.
__label__1,"I became 20% stupider after watching this movie: Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Horrible script, beyond predictable, a major waste of money. And I'm not just talking about the money paid to see it---I'm talking about the money put into it.I enjoy action movies and hero movies, super or otherwise. This could have been and should have been cool. But Seth Rogen shouldn't have had any part in it. Instead of taking the action movie and putting a twist on it, he should have stepped aside. It did not work.I saw an interview with Rogen where he said that he got stoned before he wrote scripts. Dude, that is so obvious. This movie was an utter waste of talent (even the Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz wasn't any good!), special effects and a cool car."
__label__2,"MORE LATE 50'S/EARLY 60'S TV SHOWS ON DVD PLEASE!!!!!: When will HAWAIIAN EYE be available on DVD?? How come WB in not giving a date?? What abt other great TV shows like SURFSIDE 6, SUGARFOOT, THE DONNA REED SHOW, MY THREE SONS, TIGHTROPE, FATHER KNOWS BEST, THE DEFENDERS, MARCUS WELBY MD, BEN CASEY, DOCTOR KILDARE, THE UNTOUCHABLES, THE VIRGINIAN, LARAMIE, TALES OF WELLS FARGO, BRONCO, AND MANY MORE?? All of these classics made their leading stars FAMOUS and WELL-KNOWN WORLDWIDE.Can the studios explain in some detail what are the problems for NOT releasing some popular shows while others can be released?? Who DOES NOT want these shows to be released on DVD and WHY???Some great BRITISH shows have also not been relased upto now -- like NO HIDING PLACE, MAIGRET (the original one), Z-CARS, CALLAN, MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE, to name a few. Any dates for DVD releases of these shows??Rgds/Saifuddin CaderHONGKONG."
__label__2,Great oven. Would definitely recommend!: I would definitely buy this oven again. It makes terrific pizza everytime. Very easy to use and small enough to store in a cabinet.
__label__2,"The Abyss: This was an incredibly fascinating piece of literature that has weathered wonderfully though the eons. The Falcon has heard the Falconer, trust me on this one. When dealing with adversaries, one must remember when looking long into the abyss, the abyss looks long into you."
__label__1,"2 of out 12: These did not come from ecom, so no reflection on ecom. Purchased Lenmar 2000mAh AA NiMH about a year ago, tried charge these over and over and over again without success. Only 2 out of the 12 worked. Tried different chargers, still no go. Contacted Lenmar who said they did not offer any kind of warranty no matter when you bought them. I have rechargeable batteries over 10 years old that work better than these dead beats. Now the batteries are a pox on the environment. Fool me once shame on Lenmar."
__label__2,"The Brothers march on: This is the one series of books, that I never tire of. If a book has to do with Raistlin, the mage, or anyone related, I have read or ordered that book and I have never been dissapinted. The story tells well through all the continuing sagas. Thank you Margaret Weis and thank you Tracy Hickman. You are the epitamy of style, magic and entertainment.Toni from Petaluma, Ca"
__label__1,absolute dreck written by a hack: Peter Hart has been thoroughly and totally discredited as a brit apologist for the murder of thousands of irish people. This book is a pack of lies.
__label__1,does not work very well.: Too loud and does not work very well. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Never really warms up the small bathroom we have it in.
__label__1,"Good display but inconvenient & not radio controlled: This clock is easy to read, which I like most about it, but setting the alarm requires more finger acrobatics than I like... hold this while rotating that, press this while holding down that, etc. Be aware that ""automatic time set"" does NOT mean radio controlled. It means the time and date were set at the factory, and a lithium battery keeps time during shipment. When you first plug it in it's already pretty close to the real time, but like any manual clock, you'll need to set it if you want it right."
__label__2,Love the feel: Very comfy and true to fit. They don't take up room in your suitcase and feel great as P.J.s too.
__label__1,"For God Sake Man, Don't Buy This Movie!: Where do I begin? My boyfriend and I are fans of fantasy movies and I've seen some bad ones, but this one takes the cake. The casting is all wrong. Al Bundy as a troll? The costuming is taken from every trendy store in NY and altered for the movie. The sets are awful. The story line is that NYC is the 10th kingdom and somehow is linked to the world of Fairy tales. The only hope to save the world of fairy tales is the Prince who was made into a dog by an evil queen. If you're going to make a fantasy movie, do it right. I would suggest buying Merlin. That was much better, as low budget fantasy movies go."
__label__2,"Great Tricycle: My 2 year old son loves his supertrike....He is very tall for his age and finding a tricycle to fit him was near impossible. Salespeople tried to suggest a small two wheeler, but he isn't ready for one yet. As soon as I saw this model I was sold. It is very secure with the large tires with a wide wheel base. It is also very durable. The frame is heavy duty metal, not the cheap, flimsy metal or plastic. If you are having a problem finding a large enough trike for a tall toddler, I suggest this one!"
__label__2,"The weapon is an extension of the body.: While nominally a book on bladed weapons, much information in this book is on motion per-se and its effective application in combat, with or without a bladed weapon. This is only natural, because the old saying that the weapon is an extension of the body is cliche but true. Hence many of the principles set forth in this book may be put to use whether you are empty handed or holding a weapon, and may well give you an advantage if ever forced to face a weapon attack."
__label__2,"BEGAN MY DAY, BEGAN AN ADVENTURE: I received this book for Christmas and began to read it on my train ride to and from work (that is, after my wife swiped it and read it first!). It was the kind of book I couldn't wait to get back into. I didn't want the adventure to end, yet could not wait for the outcome. The author seems to have astute insight into the many details of commando-type assault and stealth tactics, which I found fascinating. I highly recommend this book and you will find it a very exciting ""ride"" into an absorbing adventure."
__label__1,"Had 2 and both stopped working within 6 months.: Five years ago, purchased two Morning Industry locks (that still work to this day). Later, when we wanted to add keyless locks to the other outside doors, Morning Industry had re-designed the locks. We bought two and the unlock function on both doors began working sporatically, requiring more and more attempts to get the doors to unlock. Then, they simply wouldn't unlock the doors - all within 6 months. Keyless Entry Locks are not cheap and, if I had it to do over again, I would not invest the time and money for this keypad lock."
__label__1,"don't waste your time on this one: After reading the reviews on the book cover, I was excited to read this book. I kept waiting for it to be worth my while,and endured to the end--in great disappointment. What a waste of time. I got the feeling the author is a sexually deprived woman who made a goal to make every relationship in the book sexual. It was tacky and uncomfortable. The language was offensive. The story lines were weak. The whole reading experience was a waste of good time I should have spent elsewhere. Don't bother to read this one--there are plenty of better things to do with your time."
__label__2,"See Ar-Nuld Kill All The Big Bad Dudes!!!(And Ms. Alonso Is HOT!!!): This is actually a pretty good adapatation of a Stephen King book which is a rarity in itself. It concerns a Futuristic Earth where a game show sends ""Stalkers"" out to hunt down and kill their victims. This is kind of like World Wrestling with a BIG shot of Testosterone. Once again Ar-nuld walks away without a scratch from his many fights and a big PLUS for this movie is the presence of the beautiful Mara Conchita Alonso who has a very sexy accent!!!This lady is an actressof tremendous talent and it is a real shame that we do not see enough of her in movies these days."
__label__1,"Way too little too late: These two singles are utter garbage. Sure, we get the videos on DVD, thats great and I'm not complaining about that, but couldn't they put better audio on the discs? 2 channel 192 AC3, I mean really how cheap. There should have been at least PCM streams (like Salival) or maybe 5.1 mix to make it all worth while. The audio quality of the CD which was released in HDCD is better than whats on these DVDs. No wonder I could not find any info on what audio was on the discs before I bought, they didn't want us to know or people like me would not have bought them. Hopefully the new album won't be available only on 8-track cassette."
__label__1,"Dateline: The Eternal Edition: The story is truely compelling and the book needed to be written, but would have been better if it followed the format of ""Skipping Christmas,"" a small, quick read.Instead, we have an edition of Dateline that just never ends. If you purchase this book, go into it with the understanding that every couple of pages is like hitting a commercial break. First, you read what you already know. Then, you get a quick promo of what is to come. The problem is the end never seems to come. I can almost imaging Stone Phillips shaking his head around saying, ""More on that, when we come back.""Sorry, Mr. Grisham, but this is your worst book. And, please realize that such a review comes from someone who owns all first edition hardcovers of previous books and I've taken into consideration ""A Painted House,"" a book I was unable to finish due to severe bordom."
__label__2,"Well made: X-Acto X5177 Basic Woodcarving Set is very well made. The handle is solid and strong and there are more than enough blades for most needs. My only complaint is that the storage box could have been designed a bit better. The blades tend to fall out of their storage slots in the base and some simply lay alongside the handle. Otherwise, the tool itself is a good value."
__label__1,"Do not buy it: The unit started and ran flawlessly, at first, with excellent cutting capability. However, it very quickly began stalling unless you kept extra rpm;s going. In the course of fellling a 50 ft. tree and limbing it, it stallled about 75 times. By time I was through the recoil failed to operate on the starter rope.It would cost me about $100 to get it fixed so I tossed it and will never buy another Poulan. I strongly suggest that you avoid this sub-standard brand."
__label__1,"WOW...what happened?.....: I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it..."

__label__1,Taking too l ong to receive!!!!: I ordered this game in August and still waiting. I actually bought it for my son. Actually he's waiting.
__label__1,"Cringe-worthy: Jack's Jack (again), Keanu Reeves is still the worst actor in the history of cinema, and Diane Keaton's over-the-top performance is an embarassing study in ham-handed vanity.Frances McDormand's brilliant, but underused. Oh yeah, and this silly little ode to ego is, like, five hours long. Enjoy."
__label__2,"Sturdy, fun, balls: These balls are sturdy and fun. They have plenty of bounce and hold up to some chewing. Our retrievers love them."
__label__1,"Disappointing Remake of Retro Dance Movie: Hollywood should have left the original version alone, the remake is just awful and loses the spirit of the play. It is full of energy and starts out fresh, but soon gets bogged down with a overdoing a heavy message on racism, which the first movie kept in perspective for a light and fluffy teen musical.It was fun to look back through rose-colored glasses at 1962 and overall simplistic view of the times. The first movie was better - even though this version of ""Hairspray"" was fun seeing John Travolta in drag."
__label__2,"Big hit!: This DVD is a big hit with my 4 year old. She watches it over and over and walks around the house singing the songs. Unlike some of the movies, there are no parts that scare the younger kids, so you don't need to be careful about who else is watching."
__label__2,"Michael M: I have owned one other Sensa pen and when I went to buy a refill I took advantage of the offer to buy the Cloud 9. This is just another wonderful Sensa product. I choke and try to break my writing instruments. This pen keeps me from doing so. I allows my usually terrible penmanship to be much better and more readable. Just a very comfortable way to write. It takes longer to get the refills than the pen. Same company, whats that about?"
__label__1,Not that great.: This item took up so much space. It made my tv look so much smaller than it already is. Reception didn't get that much better even if I placed it close to the window or other spots in my room. I'd suggest you get a regular rabbit ears antenna.
__label__2,Amazing: World of Warcraft Battlechest is an absolutely amazing product. I was skeptical about online gaming and have avoided. But about a month ago my tv died while I was sick and since I was bedridden for 5 days I could only sleep and read so much. So I purchased WoW Battlechest and started playing. It is by far the best video game experience I've ever been a part of. I am not a complete convert to the online gaming rage that has been happening for years...I finally get why so many people for the online experience and why World of Warcraft is the number 1 online game. Truly amazing. I already know my PS3 will become my blue-ray player and occasional gaming device now that I have found World of Warcraft. I highly recommend this product.
__label__1,Elementary School Level Writing: This might be a good kids book. It is written in a rudimentary and lecturing style which is terribly irritating.
__label__2,"Yes another live album, but this is diferent.....: There are interesting facts about the released of stripped:- Basically it is an ""unpugged album"" from the Stones.- It was the very first interactive cd.When I first bought this cd, it was the very first interactive multimedia record ever done (booklet came with instructions, intercative material, etc...also appears the very first Rolling stones site, by 1994 whe the internet was so new, the site shows only merchandise in just a few pages, all those years ago), it is very interesting looking and hearing ""hidden tracks"".Also, during the Voodoo Lounge tour, the Stones perform some ""surprise gigs"" in some cities.In the time of the Unplugged records, this is a testimony of great tracks recorded in a different way we used to hear the Stones.It is a great album, quite diferent, and of course ""Like a Rolling Stones"", a classic made a classic."
__label__1,"The DVD was damage, and I was not able to enjoy the movie!: I was not able to enjoy Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars, because the DVD was damage!! I wish I could send it back!! OK"
__label__2,"For the Liquorice Lover: Excellent breath freshner for the one who wants something other than a minty taste. Tried them once from a WalMart store, but have not been able to find them anywhere so I looked to their web-site and was directed to ecom. Within 3 days I had a case of six. Within another 3 days, I had another case of six, as my daughter went to ecom thinking this would make a nice Father's Day present. If I use a tin a month, I'll be back next year for more."
__label__1,"Disappointed: Great title and thoughts but more of an essay than a book. I had hoped that it would have some great insights relayed in an approachable story form. But in the end, it's too simple and doesn't have the substance I hoped for. It's setup in 3 parts and only the 2nd part about the mice/people really belongs in the book. The other parts are there to fill pages and aren't worth reading. This is one book that isn't going to change your life, but will fill 20 minutes of your lunch hour with ""some"" entertainment."
__label__2,"Awesome Gloves: I bought these gloves before I started a big project on my house involving framing and demolition. I bought these gloves because Mechanix Wear has been around for along time in the NASCAR scene and I figured if the pit crews wear them, I should try out their hardware line. In short, the gloves performed amazingly. I used them for a ton of jobs and they showed little signs of wear. As long as you buy the glove to fit the job, you won't have any problems!!! Highly recommended!"
__label__2,"Progressive ""Light""....: I agree with a previous member who said that FW takes a good riff and builds a great PROG feeling song around it---without jerking you around too much. Don't get me wrong, I like the ""jerky"" stuff too. FW is subtle prog----more like Queensryche----not like Dream Theater. It's Prog ""light"". Good musicianship, good lyrics/vocals, good hard edge guitar. By the way, I saw FW in concert twice last summer (opening for QR and DT). Awesome!!!!!!!"
__label__2,"Timber Framer: To date I have purchased three books on timber framing. I would buy anyone of them again, but this is definitely the best one for a lay person like myself. The guidance is easier to follow. I also liked the fact that he is not afraid to give specific names on where to purchase tools and supplies."
__label__2,"This book is heartwarming!!: I truly believe in the friendship and loyalty of a dog, so reading this book only made me love my dog even more! I appreciated the warmth of the Grogan family, the hardships they dealt with and the good times as well. Marley is truly a great dog, one of the best ""bad"" dogs! This book clarified the fact that dogs are going to be our best friends forever. I was laughing and crying throughout the book!Besides the fact that I am a dog lover, this book made me think more about my own friendships and loyalty and how they have shaped my life."
__label__1,DON'T BUY THIS: This grinding attachment leaves grease and metal in the meat. I am returning for refund. No excuse for trash like this to be sold in America. May be OK for third world use.
__label__2,"If you like horses this is the book to read: This book was a great one. I think it was one of the best books I've ever read. My favorite part was the last part, with all the adventure. So much detail and expression, I loved it. I defanitly recommend this book to others."
__label__1,"Beware of hair: I bought this product 2 years ago and it is overall, good at picking up all dust and crumbs, especially on carpets. However, as it picks up any hair, they immediately get rolled up in the roller. There is no easy way to get tangled hair off of the roller. I have to sit there and cut and pull off the dirty hair in order to keep the vacuum working well and the roller not full of hair. For people with short hair, I see how this wouldn't be a problem, but any woman knows that when you brush your hair you lose strands and they get caught in corners."
__label__1,"Poor quality machine: When we couldn't find one that would work to demonstrate for us in the store we should have just left it there. Not one of the boxes on the shelf at our local store would play the demonstration although each box was marked for it. This worked well for us for all of 2 nights before it quit working. If I put it on ""continuous"" it would cut off after 30 minutes or so, and then start playing again on it's own. Sometimes I could not even get it to turn on and then miraculously it would come on the next 3 times I tried then go back to not turning on with the switch. Save your money on this one and go somewhere else to purchase a sound machine that will actually work."
__label__1,"This Was a Law & Order SVU episode with Robin Williams....: Uh, I get this was also inspired by a real event but....Law & Order: SVU definitely hit on this over what 2-3 seasons ago.......Plus they had Robin Williams sooooo, there is no contest...I'd really rather sit through a 45 min prime time soapie with Williams than this...at least I cared while watching Law & Order..."
__label__1,"WAITING FOR YEARS: I am truly disappointed with this author. I talked to the author on several occasions about the upcoming new edition in 2006. Now this edition is being offered for $100. Mrs. Mitchell, I do believe you are an expert in helping African American students get into law school, but this is a complete disappointed. With e-books being a convenient & easy way to publish a book, I would think you could update and publish quickly. i hope you update this book soon. i would love to get the opportunity to use it to apply to law school."
__label__2,"An Excellent Value: I was so tired of buying junky home tools from Home Depot for about the same cost I decided to take a chance on this refurbished model, and I'm glad I did. For what I could have bought a 1/4"" consumer product from a big box retailer I got this heavy duty 1/2"" workhorse. It's powerful, has a great ""turbine""-like whir to it, and I expect it will last a very long time."
__label__2,"Sooooo Relaxing!: As a massage therapist, I am constantly on the lookout for music that will be relaxing for my clients. I bought this CD with a gift card that needed to be spent at a book store where I couldn't find a book I wanted. Desperate to just spend it and get it over with, I finally ""settled"" on this CD without having heard it. Wow! Am I ever glad I stumbled on this marvelous work. I listened to it as I drifted off to sleep and had the best night's sleep I've had in ages. I felt that my chakras had truly been aligned. I played it for a couple of clients as I gave them massages, and both commented on how the music seemed to put them into a ""different consciousness"" that was so relaxing they couldn't believe it. I'm definitely going to download more of Halpern's work. I'm a fan."
__label__2,"The Best MxPx CD of Them All: this is the best MxPx cd of all of them. I own all 11 of MxPx's cd and I'm always listening to this one. I also like Teenage Politics and their Live At The Show cd. So if your a long time MxPx fan and don't have this cd yet or if your just starting to listen to them, forget the new stuff and come back and listen to the best sound MxPx will ever have(unless they go back to real punk like this cd is)."
__label__2,"When quality loses out the cost?: Syfy I remember when you stood against the common herd of television, and now you wollow in trashy TV like rest. What will we see next on your coming attractions. SNOOKY in Space? God let it be so! Sans the Spacesuit. You had Eureka, BSG, Santuary, Warehouse13, and Stargate SG1, SG Alantis. Now you do Wrestling? Scare Tactics and redubed movies for Eastern Europe? Such dreams they were and what a shoddy nightmare you have become.Eureka is gone and Warehouse 13 will follow soon I am sure, and there will be no more electronic dreams. Just trashy video pableum."

__label__2,"Good ministry: I enjoyed the release from Antonia. It was very refreshing to hear the song ""Butterfly"". I heard Antonia in concert with the group Isaac Mullis and Divine Promise and another act. Divine Promise is also on the Trigospel label. The show I saw was awesome and I bought both the Divine Promise and the Antonia cd. It is well worth it to buy these trigospel products.Keep up the good work and bless you all."
__label__1,"Not all that responsive: I've had this mouse for 3 months now and ever since the purchase it lags consistently. I have the bluetooth dongle about 2ft from the mouse at all times and have replaced the battery twice. After a while, the signal will be restored and it'll work fine but will sporadically lag. Also, it takes several clicks on a link before it will respond. Not a very good product."
__label__2,"Highest recommendation: A stunning recording of these pieces, which range from the openly beautiful to passages of sadness, vexation, and grief. The Naxos booklet provides an interesting essay by the ensemble's conductor, Marco Longhini, with techincal and aesthetic appreciation of each madrigal, and some history relating to the scene in which Monteverdi composed - a sample can be read by visiting the Naxos website.*The recorded sound quality is phenomenal. The all-male ensemble is flawless, with the countertenors being particularly powerful. The recording was made at the Chiesa di San Pietro in Vincoli, Verona, and the acoustic is wonderfully full and resonant while retaining exemplary clarity."
__label__2,"You would have guessed it if you weren't PC!: Facts explaining why the obviously absent AIDS epidemic has NOT reached the proportions which we were led to believe. An amazing preface explaining the route this manuscript took from typewriter through publication to the bookshelf. Even if you don't believe it you should read what the PC's are foisting upon us,"
__label__2,"Great Product, Very Useful Early On: We used this for the first 2-3 weeks and it was great. It kept track of everything we needed because our baby slept a lot and we had a lot of other things going on around the house. Unfortunately, we didn't need it after a while because our baby, like all babies, now tells us when there's something wrong! I would guess this would be a great thing for parents of multiples, busy parents with a lot on their plates, or ""scatter-brained"" (no offense) parents who need the little extra help!"
__label__1,"Batteries DO NOT LAST: I have ordered these types on ecom before from another seller as my wife loves em but, I decided to go with the slightly cheaper ones here and paid dearly! The first of the 3 we opened had a baterry that last literally 2 mins before it died. We decided it was a dud and moved on to the next one which lasted all of 3 mins before dying. We haven't tried the 3rd since by that time the moment was gone :(Pay the extra dollar or two and steer clear of these."
__label__1,"Two thumbs down: One of the most ridiculous, unrealistic martial arts movie ever made.Just look attentively at Eric Robert's stance in the ring. And that idiotic cowboy hat that Chris Penn wearing and sobbing:""What are you counting them for?"" after losing the breaking match. Yeah! This is as close to reality as it can be. And the crowd at the bar rooting for the American karate team? Give me a break! Phillip Rhee and the Korean team are the only people who make any sense as far as martial arts in this movie.Best of the best? No! Worst of the worst!You want real action? Watch ISKA Strike Force K1."

__label__2,"Matheson at his compelling best: ""I couldn't put it down"" is a phrase so overused as to be nearly devoid of meaning, yet it almost literally applies in this case. I started ""Hell House"" the afternoon before a concert I'd been looking forward to for months; by evening, the concert had become an irritating intrusion on my reading. I jumped back into the book during intermission and ran home after the concert to finish the novel in one nail-biting sitting.Yes, it's really that good, assuming one has any affinity for horror fiction. Even Matheson rarely achieved the continuous intensity of this gem. ""I Am Legend"" may be superior from a literary standpoint, but ""Hell House"" is his most memorable accomplishment.One warning: don't come to this book expecting cheap thrills. It's disturbing-scary, not Boo!-scary."
__label__2,Just because its Armin: I would suggest this CD to people who are over whelmed with the pathetic mixing by Tiesto on Myana..amazing tracklist and the beauty ends there.If u do want to buy Armin's best CD...go for Transparence 004...one of the best Cd's I've ever heard.
__label__2,"Excellent,fats paced read: This was an excellent read and continued in the great tradition of the series.I think it is really helpful to start with the first one to get a better feel for the relationship between Caesar and Marco. But after that, they really pull you in and I can't put them down!! Not ""heavy"" historical fiction but well written and a real easy read. Author seems to have done his research on Roman battle tactics and weapons."
__label__1,"What a bummer!: i give this film 1 star, because no star was not an option. it was boring, disjointed and senseless. in sum, totally disappointing. a major directing and editing disaster.i find it hard to believe it was a bbc production, which are usualy top notch. with that, and the fact that i'm a jane austin groupie, i bought the film without checking the ratings. i actually watched it twice,because i was sure i had missed something. there was nothing to miss.northanger abbey is the only austin book i haven't read yet, but i am looking forward to reading it in order to find out how far off the film missed its mark. i'm sorry i can't return it--the used copies don't seem to be selling very well."
__label__2,"classic: I liked this one, watched it twice. I'm a pretty big fan of American Dad but I wouldn't watch all of them a second time."
__label__1,Bug Zapper: I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
__label__2,"Beautiful and mature performances from a gifted prodigy.: The great cellist Rostropovich took a special interest in the exceptionally-gifted young cellist, Han-Na Chang, and conducts the accompaniment on her debut recording. Listening to this incredible young artist one can understand why Rostropovich regarded her as special. Personally, I've never heard a better performance of Tchaikovsky's Roccoco Variations and her performance of the Saint Saens Concerto can stand comparison with that by the incomperable Rostropovich. The performance of Bruch's Kol Nidrei is also quite beautiful. Chang is an exceptionally-gifted young artist whose performances have a maturity which belies her age. Highly recommended."

Torg: a mild-mannered web designer. Bun-bun: Torg's pet rabbit, a cute talking mini-lop with a dark past. Zoe: innocent college student, neighbor, and straight-woman. Kiki: the friendly ferret who says, ""Don't plan Torg's death! Stay good, Sam!"" Including parodies of Star Trek, X-files, and a bonus story not found on the Internet: A Day in the Park with Bun-bun and Teddy Weddy."

__label__2,"Unforgettable.: Great exercise for those who like to think about the films they watch. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan whose original screenplay makes the audience feels just like Pearce's character, who knows what is going to happen, but not what happened in the moment before."
__label__1,"LAME outdated, mainstream information: This magazine is a joke. The first three issues had nothing that could not be found in a twenty year old issue of Self magazine. It reads like a statin advertisement, spewing the same old bull about high cholesterol without mentioning any of the myriad negative side effects of statins (like killing you of liver disease before you are even old enough to have heart disease).It contains very little research information, and nothing that is original or cutting edge in regards to prevention or nutrition. Complete waste of money!"
__label__2,"no real reason for the sticker: I have wanted to buy this album for years and never did maianly because i don't like buying albums with partental advisory stickers, but after i bought 8701 and liked it so much i broke down and bought this one. There is some dirty sexaul talk on the lil kim and usher track just like me, but there is nothing else explecit on the cd. this album along with tyrese 2000 watts really did'nt deserve thier stickers. I know this album is not for little kids, but to have the same sticker that enmeiem and kid rock have is to me not right. So if you have debated on buying this because of the label, don't you would be missing a great r and b cd that is actaully less dirty then some that don't have sticker's such as ruff endz love crime's and the now stickered janet jackson all for you which is flithe that is neither art nor music."

I get a message saying its not compatible with Windows 7. I have gone so far as to install Windows XP to VMware BUT Starforce STILL won't let me play the game.The game should include this warning.""Warning, we enjoy victimizing our customers, and spoiling our chances for repeat business; For this reason our lousy software comes with DRM.""I gave these people my hard earned money.

This CD is 100% German language and I love it. I tired to stop listening to it but it has been the only CD in my car for weeks now. So if you are looking for a German language CD but are unfamiliar with German artists, this is the CD for you!"

I have yet to try a recipe out of this cookbook that hasn't been a breeze to prepare and also tastes wonderful.Who cares if it is low-fat? It won't occur to you as you try the various soups and stews. Simply enjoy it for the delicious meal that it truly is."
__label__1,"Doesn't work for Logitech T-CL13: After reading the all the glowing reviews for this adapter, I thought I couldn't go wrong. Unfortunately, it's not working with my T-CL13. I tried both a PS/2 keyboard and mouse, both Microsoft, and those worked, but I suspect they'd both work with a standard ""straight through"" type adapter as well."
__label__2,"a romance that goes beyond formula: I am not a romance reader, but I am a fan of L'Engle. ""And Both Were Young"" is a well-written romance for teens that touches on darker issues. The novel deals realistically with death and with a daughter's feelings of betrayal when her father, a widower, dates another woman. The horror of World War II and its affects on the characters, especially Paul, is realistic, but still leaves hope for the future."
__label__1,"Not always what they seem: I was disappointed by the book. I didn't get what I expected. The stories weren't bad, but how the book was organized was confusing. All the subheadings were ""when you want it and she doesn't"" ""when she wants it and you don't"". Please people get more creative. Like I said for five bucks the stories were worth it, but I would recommend completely skipping the table of contents."
__label__1,"Several songs about killing animals: I bought this CD for my toddler daughter in an effort to branch out from the usual children's music. Musically, the songs are fun to listen to. But a closer listen to the lyrics was off-putting for me.A number of the songs are centered around hunting, i.e. killing tigers, bears, geese. I am not anti-hunting (provided it is done responsibly) but I don't particularly want to sing songs about killing animals with my 2 year old! Particularly since we tend to sing along and she really pays attention to the words. If you share this sentiment, I would avoid this CD."
__label__2,The Truth Shall Set You Free: This is an outstanding book. This is full of information you just can't find in the popular media. Levin should be the next Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction. Some of the other reviews are from people who have quite obviously not read the book.
__label__1,"Dont bother, its not like a snocone machine!: This toy is horrible, you need to work out 7 days a week just to turn it for 5 minutes, and using 3/4 cup of salt for 1/4 cup of a McFlurry is just a waste of money and salt. Kids dont bother, parents will be bothered by this, I dont have kids and I was very bothered by this toy, it takes forever to put together and if you want real fun, get a cotton candy maker or a ICEE maker, something that actually works."

__label__2,Very helpful & thorough: This book is great as a reference for people who have the disease and also as a tool for those who are looking for a diagnosis. The author is considered to be the authority on the disease and it's nice to have a place to go to for correct information. There is much misinformation out there and this book dispels the myths.

__label__2,"VERY WITTY SATIRE: I was fortunate enough to see the world premiere of this film at the Montreal World Film Festival and it was a riot. I laughed along with everyone else when I heard the spectacular cast shoot out very funny one-liners. But, maybe, if I had just seen this movie when it was released, I wouldn't have liked it as much. Maybe the rest of the crowd manipulated me into laughing... who knows. Still, William H. Macy delivers a performance that will have you rolling on the floor in tears, if your in the mood for a very humorous, dry satire about Hollywood taking over a small town. I've never been a fan of either Alec Baldwin or Sarah Jessica Parker, but I do gain respect for them, because they pull their roles off very well. So, if your in the mood for a light hearted satire about Hollywood, and are in the mood for a very well written screenplay, go see this little gem with epic performances."
__label__1,"Muddy sound with no detail: They were pretty cheap but even so they have really bad sound, muddy &distorted with no detail in mids or highs.Recommended cheaper Earphones under $20:Koss Spark Plugs (older silver/maroon ones) good bass, a little fuzzy highs.Logitec Xbox/Playstation earhones (work great on pc and are the best sounding for under $50)deep clear bass and crisp highs."
__label__2,"Great product!: I just got back from Roraima Tepuy that its one of the most olders rock formations in the Venezuelan ""Gran Sabana"" and the pole worked perfect. My friends poles arrived bented while this kaito did just fine... got nothing to envy to the ones in the ""hundred dollars"" rank. The compass and the thermometer are the same of the keychains so nothing special about them, but the pole is great."
__label__2,"Good value for money: I got this so I could use Skype and save money on international calls. Furthermore, I specifically wanted to find a headset that, just like a regular phone receiver, leaves one ear uncovered so I can hear when the real phone is ringing or someone's at the door, etc.The sound is good and people claim to have no trouble understanding me. I wear glasses and the other headsets I tried all pinched after a while, but this one is quite comfortable no matter how long I wear it.All in all, I'm really pleased with this headset!"

__label__2,"A FABULOUS ALBUM!!!: Forget the know-nothings that enjoy bashing the big Mac, this is one of Sir Paul's finest albums -EVER-! Great tracks with a highly charged emotional edge, stylistically this album goes from strength to strength. Rinse the Raindrops is likely Paul's hardest rocking track since Helter Skelter! Pure bliss. Also forget the lackluster sales that merely point to a public infatuated with disposable pop. This album is a keeper and will be hard to find in any 2nd hand shop! I give a big tip 'o the hat to Paul for this magnificent effort!"
__label__2,No more searching through regular cardboard boxes for my shoes!: It's great to be able to go into my closet and not waste time searching for that elusive pair of shoes that I wear once a year.

Some of the boxes I used to store Lego? pieces in my son's room. ***** 5 stars
__label__1,"Terrible: Garbage. This entire book is garbage. I thought it would be a good idea to have this around for new drinking games with a few of my buds. No. There is not 1 viable game in this book that doesn't sound like it was made up by a 13 year old. I had my last review deleted, probably because of profane language, and I haven't looked at the book in a while but I do recall there being a game where you drink when an inning starts when you are watching a baseball game. Or another has a keg and a team of 5 people just try to drink it as fast as possible. This book has that kind of stuff in it. Just terrible. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. Just google drinking games."
__label__2,Highly intense: This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder when and what is going to go wrong. The characters kept the movie interesting. De Niro was perfect for the part. Norton was excellent. The twist at the end made you want to stand up and cheer for De Niro.
__label__1,"work great for 2 months, not any more: Bought this to use with ZI8 and it worked great for about 2 months. After 2 months, I noticed that the sound playback was at a very low volume. Unfortunately, these low volume recordings were very important events, and I'm disappointed that the audio isn't good. I've tested the ZI8 with a different stereo mic and that works, so I know the problem isn't with the ZI8. Reseller has a 30 return policy and Sony's is only 90 days. Very disappointed this didn't last. I took the mic apart and the noticed the low quality soldering for one of the mics. The GND is shorted the White wire on the Right mic. This can't be correct? The PADs are very close together and I can't seem to remove enough solder to separate these PADS so that they aren't shorted. Wish I had a schematic of this board."
__label__1,"A waste....: This series began with alot of mystery and promise, but by book 5 it was evident that King had lost his way. I eagerly waited for this book - Song of Susannah was such a waste of time, but I waded through it anyway just so I could be ready for the final book.As I read through the book I began to have a feeling of trepidation. How many of you remember reading The Wolves of the Calla and realizing that, with only 20 or so pages left, the book was almost over and nothing had really been accomplished? Thats how I felt once Major Characters began dying in this book.And this book had a horrible finish.Do not read this book. Instead, write your own ending. How do you want Roland to come out of this adventure? The ending King gives is awful. How awful? It's like playing a video game and, when you beat it, a message comes up and says, ""Now try it again on a harder level.""Tripe. Hackneyed. Drivel. Pulp."
__label__1,"Boy Is This A Stupid Movie: Forty years ago Hogan's Heroes worked because it was pure farce and its German POW camp was acceptable as a setting for a comedy, while Life Is Beautiful failed in large part because a German concentration camp is not a place to set humor. I was told this was a charming movie with a lot of joy within it. ""Joy despite the misery,"" is what someone said. I found it ridiculous, boring, and an insult to the memory of those who were murdered by the Third Reich. Roberto Benigni wasn't funny, just manically irritating. The actor needs either animal tranquilizers or a punch in the mouth, I'm not sure which. Maybe both. Life Is Beautiful was a horrible film that shocked me with its idiocy, far-fetched plot turns, and overall annoying awfulness start to finish. How filmgoers ever fell for this incredibly unfunny waste of time baffles me."

__label__1,"I would not recommend this book to anyone:: This book did not address the pros and cons of staying at home with the children. It only said how great it was to stay home...and it kept saying things like how us women/mothers have a duty to both our husbands and ""God"" to stay at home with our children. I work part time outside the home currently, and am deciding whether to stay home full time. This book offered me no help whatsoever in making my decision--it offered no stories by women in similar situations. I am not a religious person, and I resent being told it is my duty to be obeidient to my husband or to some God and that I should stay home. I cannot recommend this book to anyone based on that!"

__label__1,"Could Have Been Good: The story in this book is a good one, but it is written in such a stilted and stiff way of writing that it turns out to be just plain boring. Perhaps the author should find something else to do besides writing books."
__label__2,"Great Read: Before I read this book I felt that there was nothing wrong with the Harry Potter series if you took it for what it is: fiction. But I soon realized after reading this particular book and MANY others defending both sides of the argument, that they are a real danger. Although fiction, the Harry Potter series has a profound effect on the reader at the subconcious level. It may sound like total nonsense but these books provoke an almost insatiable desire to gain these powers for ones self, which then leads one to look into such things as Witchcraft and the Occult. It may seem far fetched, but it's incredible how much of an effect media like Harry Potter can have on an individuals starting at the subconcious level. It's completely undetectable, making it an even greater threat. This book is excellent because it raises awareness of this real danger not only for Catholics, but for everyone with a solid Christian faith."
__label__1,"Don't buy: I bought this stroller to use with my daughter. It had all the features that I was looking for and some! After 2.5 months the bracket that holds the frame of the basket and supports the seat broke completely off, thus offering no support for the seat and a useless basket. I contacted Evenflo and they offered to replace the stroller with a completely different stroller in a different pattern, the one I have is no longer available and there are no replacement parts. I would not recommend buying this stroller."
__label__1,"Dull pictures of exciting events: These two photographers managed to put themselves into the middle of where history was being made, and have next to nothing to show for it. There probably were great moments of tension, passion and danger taking place while they were taking pictures, but none of them show up in the book. Most of the pictures look like news shots from a midwestern livestock show. OK, it's Bosnia. How about capturing some emotional depth, or at least something more than flat played-out scenes the NYT has already run into the ground."

__label__2,"She Pisses Off Psychos: Private detective Jill Babcock has a way of finding trouble. As she puts it, ""I go around pissing off psychopaths. You could say it's a gift."" Well, in Steven Pipe's entertaining and fast-paced debut novel, Babcock uses that gift quite often, with unpredictable results.Soon after taking the case of a star baseball player who's seen hanging out with some shady characters, Babcock is slipping into the homes of crime figures, engaging in gun play with thugs, grilling stippers in between pole dances, investigating murders, and offending just about everybody with her wisecracking, sarcastic comments. Ultimately, Babcock and her uncoventional methods uncover a side of baseball that some characters will do just about anything to keep secret.If you like fun, action-packed page turners with stories that break the mold, I encourage you to give Steven Pipe's ""Squeeze"" a try. You'll enjoy it."

__label__1,"A waste of the paper it is printed on: I was expect high standards from this book given that is was from Sams Publishing, but it looks like no one proof read this book. There are missing or incorrect images throughout this book. When pointing this out to Sams Publishing, they fobbed me off telling me that they would get in touch with the author to get him to send the missing or incorrect pictures. I am still waiting 2 months later. I would say ignore this book, unless it is second edition. I just find it would be a good book, if someone had check it out first. Nevermind, try again. :("
__label__1,"Nice original score, horrible failure of a movie: This was advertised as a grindhouse blaxploitation throwback. Instead it comes across like a less inspired Troma movie (one of the zero budget ones that Lloyd Kaufman didn't direct). Fantastic soundtrack though. Buy that instead of the movie."
__label__1,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK: For some strange reason which I have never been able to figure out, my mother gave me this book to read as a child. I was emotionally scarred by reading this book about dog-torture, and I have never recovered. PARENTS: PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THIS BOOK! I do not know why a book about a poor little dog being horribly tortured and nearly killed makes for a good children's book. Please do not inflict the pain and torment upon your children that was inflicted upon me. Spare your children this horror."

__label__2,Groundbreaking work: This book presents a very solid and eye opening theology of ministry for the Church. O'Meara develops his theology by examining the history and theology of ministry in Church. This book is an absolute must for those involved in ministry.
__label__1,"TERRIBLE!!: I have never entered a review before, but this book was so bad I had to stop you from wasting your time. I tried to enter a 0 rating but I guess 1star is as low as you can go. The reviews were mixed, but I bought this book anyway because I run a call center and I thought perhaps that would make it more interesting for me. Total waste of time, can't believe that the type A in me wouldn't just let me quit half way through. I kept thinking the ""real"" storyline was yet to be introduced, or maybe some interesting plot twist was coming. Boring characters, unrealistic scenarios. I will never read another book by this author."
__label__1,"Disappointed Customer: I was very disappointed with the quality when I bought these. It says they fit 8.5-x-11-inch sheets of paper. My paper is 8.5-x-11-inch and it sticks out the top by a quarter of an inch. A few of the sheet protectors didn't even have the top open, so the paper wouldn't go in.I ended up going to Staples and buying the Staples store brand, which are much better! :D"

__label__2,"A good book, but not on the level of the previous ones: I was disappointed with this one. I mean, don't get me wrong; I was good, and i enjoyed it, but like I said, it just didn't live up to Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears. It was, however, several orders of magnitude better than Blood of the Fold. The only reason to read Blood of the Fold is so that you're not lost when you pick up Temple of the Winds. The series as a whole, though, is incredible. Okay, so the fact that Richard is Darken Rahl's son is cliche, (imagine Rahl saying, in a low, breathy voice, ""Richard... I am your father. Come over to the dark side) but overall, it's good. Even though the plot devices are a bit banal, the writing has been impecable throughout, even in Blood of the Fold. So, what I'm trying to say here is, read this series, but don't rate it on a book-by-book basis. You'll be much more satisfied that way."
__label__1,"Did not like but to expensive to send back: This was a waste of money. The broom did not work on my carpet. I did not pick up pet hair. The shipping was just as expensive as the broom, so I kept it. Maybe I will find some other use for it. Don't know what, but I guess it will sit in the closet until I do."

I have an Olevia 232T and I think the image is clearer and brighter through the VGA cable than through component. I know some people complain about ""wash-out"" but I felt the image was much more vibrant and vivid through VGA. If you think the image is too bright, you can always turn down the brightness in the game. Great cable and great picture for the price!"

Each of her albums tell a different story, and this one is mostly about love and the loss of. I love to listen to it before bedtime or to reminisce. The songs are like old friends, some more uplifting than others. My favorite Tori album."
__label__2,"A swinging good time.........: Excellent top notch arrangements with a swinging band. Great dance tempos and mix of original and covers. Everyone should check this band out, since they are out and about all over the place. I even picked up there Christmas CD to find some more beautiful arrangements. A six piece ensemble with one HUGE sound."
__label__2,"Definitely in my top 10: I first saw this movie in the theaters, and it was amazing!! I can't count the number of times I laughed. It's a good family film, even though it's PG-13, but these days, 8 yr olds are watching R movies....Zac Efron is AMAZING in this movie. Definitely better than the HSM movies he did. This movie is definitely in my Top 10 Favorite Movies."

__label__1,"Do not watch with your kids: I see a reviewer mentioned this before, but I would like to stress that you should definitely not watch this movie with kids who do not know the real Santa story. It should be rated at least PG if not 12. Apart from that, I also found the movie a bit lame, and I like chick flicks. If you love Henry Winkler (I don't) or find Morgan smoulderingly attracive (not me) it might help. Otherwise it's a wholly unbelievable and badly acted movie. I know I know, bah humbug! Buy The Holiday instead, it's great for grown-ups!"
__label__2,"Bette D. is great as always: I rated this movie 4 stars only because, while being a very big fan of Bette Davis, I found the story of this movie a bit too ""soap Opera"". I love Bette most when she plays more profond and serious roles like in the ""The Corn is Green"". I found the later absolutely exceptional."
__label__2,"Dada's Fourth Album Not Quite as Great as the Previous Three: Album 4 is a small step down from previous efforts, but if you had never heard the earlier efforts you'd still think you'd stumbled onto something tremendous. It's perhaps a tad overproduced. My favorite tracks are ""Where You're Going"" and ""This Thing Together"". Least favorite: ""California Gold""."

__label__1,"Some Clever Lyrics, But Mostly A Bore!: Jeff Buckley had a great vocal range and some nice guitar work on this album, and quite a few clever lyrics, but he is such a bore. Outstanding tracks like ""The Sky Is A Landfill"" and ""Witches' Rave"" show how powerful his lyrics can be, but other tracks like ""Everybody Here Wants You"" and ""Your Flesh Is So Nice"" shows how corny, pointless, and annoying 85% of Jeff's music is.His vocal range is impressive, and his upper range sounsd quite soothing and lovely, but for the most part his voice is an annoying whine, and he sounds way too desperate and helpless for an intimate relationship on his more ""daring and edgy"" songs, yet he sings such songs with no grace, elegance or fire the way Queen's outstanding Freddie Mercury did when HE sang a dirty song. He makes me laugh at how corny he is.Don't waste your money. Buy a few of his singles, but skip this album. This guy has nothing new to offer you or your music collection."
__label__2,"good dvd: I really enjoyed this workout. Lizbeth Garcia is great teacher, she makes it comfortable for the audience to be there even though we are in our homes. Some instructors are loud and obnoxious, Lizbeth is the total opposite. You will enjoy it."
__label__2,"A bit dated, but still chock full of great information.: I have had this book for about 10 years now, and it was quite difficult to find at that time. There's never been a grammar question or question pertaining to proper usage and format that I wasn't able to find the answer to in this book. I strongly recommend it for secretaries, office assistants or anyone who is interested in proper word usage, grammar and just plain old-fashioned letter writing."

I give this book to all of my friends who ask for a ""good wildflower book"" to take in the woods."

The controls where hard to understand.The ships where 'ok' but in an over-all it could have been so much better. The only good points in this game where you got phasers and torpedoes. which you can get in any start trek game really.So my advice. RENT the thing first before you fork over some hard earned cash."
__label__1,Arresting Developments: The first 2 seasons were better but on the whole this series was hilariousand one of the smartest comedies on the TV.
__label__1,it's ok but if i were you i'd get MADDEN.: Simple : get madden it is much more realistic and challenging than this game. Sega has got the basketball game right but EA has football right. So if you are looking for the best football games out the get Madden 2003 and NCAA Football 2003. You won't be disappointed.
__label__2,Brought me right back!: Great soundtrack! Tis brought me right back to my heyday! Kind of scary actually. I don't know if today's youth will get it but for us 40 somethings....oh yeah!
__label__1,"book not a thorough treatise of the subject: Although somewhat comprehensive early on, the book dwells on the Chevrolet from 1955 to 1957 and then turns to truck design. Many of the makes and models of the 50's get left out as a result."
__label__1,Not His Best: Joe Lovano is usually at the top of his game but this is just too slow for one album. Most song if not all have no beat what so ever and just too dull.
__label__2,"A comprehensive, lively history from primary sources: NEW ENGLANDERS ON THE OHIO FRONTIER is a witty and scholarly chronicle about migration to Ohio in 1802 for 41 families (settlers, not speculators) from Connecticut and Massachusetts. The McCormicks have used an unusually rich store of primary data to document the transformation of life in Ohio. Into the wilderness these settlers came with an elegant town plat which included a village green, Episcopal church, a school, and a subscription library, and within 10 years attained material culture which matched or surpassed that left in the Northeast. This case study ends in 1836 just after Worthington's incorporation. The McCormicks are scholars who write beautifully and this very accessible, colorful history ends too soon. The reader is primed for a sequel."

__label__2,"Easy instalation: The cover is almost installed in 20 minutes. Only difficulty I had, was to clip finally the cover in its place, as it was rolled together since its production, it dod not fall into place as it should. But that is just a temporary disadvantage. It looks good, is easy to handle and really a super value."
__label__1,"The Deafening Sound Of Mediocrity: The Sounds Of Sylence by Sylence Campbell is a mediocre collection of self indulgent writing that trys so hard to portray the typical ""dark, tortured, yet resurrected poet."" The author should get high grades for trying, but the result is an abysmal failure. Right from the start one must cringe at the title of this work, which would be a clever play on words referencing the popular Paul Simon song, ""The Sounds of Silence,"" except for the misspelled last word, the authors name. Poetry should make the reader think about the subject being addressed. The author fails on this point. A book of good poetry should pull the reader along, from page to page. I kept thinking 'how many more pages until this book is done,' as I hopefully searched for one decent poem (I had given up hope of finding just one good one). There are plenty of good poetry books out there. One would probably do better by picking any other poetry book at random than by buying The Sounds Of Sylence."
__label__1,"Easy to use, Poor quality answering machine: After fussing with the film cartridge for about 15 minutes in the store, I decided that the floor model suffered some abuse and that this would not be a problem for my home/office. I bought the machine, set it up, and began testing it. Very easy to set up and made good quality copies. I recorded my voice message for the answering machine and sounded like I was in a sewer (echo, mumbly sound). This is not the quality machine I want when people call my business. I returned it and am shopping for a better quality answering machine, even if it means having a separate stand-alone fax machine."
__label__2,"Perfect fit with my Vibram Bikila LS shoes: I was on the fence about which size of sock to order, but I went with the SMALL rather than the medium and I think that was the right choice.My Vibrams are 40's and the small fit perfectly with my foot and the shoes.I've been using both steadily for about two weeks and have zero complaints.The socks are a must have to aid ease of use with the Vibrams, especially if you're the parent of a very young child who won't wait around while you figure out which toe goes where."
__label__2,"Great film, LOVE Shatner: What can I SAY??`I Love William Shatner, and I think its an interesting story concept, who better to write it than ""THE Captain""....If you are a Shatner and Star Trek fan you should order this film. Thanks again ecom...."
__label__1,"Cannot be charged: There is no problem with shipping. However, the battery itself simply cannot be charged. and it is too much trouble to return as it came in with the plastic wrap. Too bad!"
__label__1,"Not all that good.: This one would have been impossible to watch were it not for its pretty good costume and set design. It looked as though at the beginning that this was going to be a decent medieval tale of adventure, but horribly cheesy dialogue and subpar acting soon put an end to that. Sadly not even the presence of Poitier can save this movie. There's only so much a great actor can do with such a bad script, surrounded by bad actors, and forced to sport such a lame hair-doo."
__label__1,"The Brad Knight Story: This book was not only disappointing but also fustrating to read. I found the entire book to be about the Brad Knight story rather than the Laci Petterson story. Every other sentence was regarding ""what he would do"" if he was on the case.When finally torturing myself to read the rest of the book, I had to shut it and throw it away after he acted as the Prosecutor & the Defense attorney, stating what he would have done in the situation. Following this chapter I learned that there was a Volume II, and I immediately tossed the unfinished book into the garbage and vowed never to read another Brad Knight novel.I think Brad lived his life through this story. It was never about anyone BUT him."
__label__1,"BORING! (and creepy.): OK. So i just played it for like a half hour. But it was one of the most boring half hours of my life! And I'm not big on creepy games like this. As you can probobly tell, it's about some alien creature that's a slave in a factory called ReptuFarms or something. The factory makes meat out of animals. Most animals in Oddworld (the would where Abe, the mane charecter lives) are extinced. I won't tell you any more of the plot. I will now tell you why i don't like it. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not big on creepy games. If you are, I guess you might like it. But it's not even 3D! It's just a 2D game where all you do is walk left and right. And the controlls are REALLY hard to remember! But, if these things don't bother you, i guess you might like it, though it's kind of old stile gaming. Well, thanks for reading. Bye!"
__label__1,"Be warned!: ""The Countdown Singers"" made reference to (kind of) are actually a band (of sorts) playing these songs. If you see any song that you like on the list of tracks then avoid these CDs altogether, because it will change the way you hear it ever after. It is that bad. Don't fall into the same trap I fell into. It did teach me not to be too confident about buying on the net."
__label__1,"Not that great...: This could have been a great album. Unfortunally it's recorded at several different venues which causes a loss of ""live feeling"". Furthermore it's edited. Deep Purple shouldn't be experienced edited. Buy one of the raw live albums with lot's of energy instead!"
__label__1,"Meh... Just meh...: I don't understand why people are fooled by this book. The story is nothing more than poor trickery. The stories are OK, but the connection between them is poor and best and almost silly at times. The language used is well done, but the some of it becomes so hard to understand it makes it worthless... All in all don't listen to the hype..."
__label__2,"Love Chick-lit - Love Vampires - Love This: Fast fun read with fashion out the kazoo. Dead End Dating is the story of a born vampire who decides to start up her own dating agency. Her dating service is geared towards humans, made and born vamps. Through the trials of running her own business she learns a lot about human and vampire nature.Lil spends most of the story lusting for a hotty made detective, Ty, who is completely off limits, and designer fashion wears. This book is the cross roads of Bridget Jones and an Ann Rice novel."

__label__2,"The Best book in the Circle of Magic Quartet: Tamora Pierce is my favorite author, and I think that out of all of the Circle of Magic books, this was her best. It sort of surprised me that she wrote a series outside of Tortall, and the books seemed kind of uncharacteristic, but if you've read any of her books before, this one is very similar to her Tortall books. If you are a fantasy fan like me, you'll love this book. It's good for people of all ages, but if you're younger and interested in Pierce, I would start with these first. I also highly reccomend that you read the other three first."
__label__2,"jeans: The jeans are fine, the packaging for shipment was fine. ecom did publish the retail price in this instance so that I knew what sort of discount I was getting. I have seen a trend with ecom though where the item, even new, has the retail price deleted so that if their partner vendors are charging a premium, one doesn't immediately know it. I've curtailed buying from ecom until I'm convinced they won't be doing this any more. They're only response to the issue was to tell me to return the item to the vendor which is a cost to me-time and money-might as well go to a brick and mortar store if I'm going to go through that inconvenience."
__label__2,"Friggin Sweet Movie: The bloodiest and most action packed Alien film since James Cameron's Aliens. I would have given this five stars except the story and characters aren't quite up to par with the first AvP film (which sadly lacked the action and gore). Still, it's one of my faves. If it's not one of yours, then your taste in movies sucks. Buy this. Buy it now.PS - Runnnn! Get to ze choppa!!!!!"
__label__2,"Tale of a Sephardic Jewish Doctor hiding from Inquisition: This is a wonderful historicl tale of a doctor who is Jewish, and how he conceals his religion from Torquemada and the Spanish inquisition. He sends his family to the safety of Africa, selling everything he owned. He however keeps his gold home key, only to pass on the key, and the memories it represents."
__label__2,"Cute!: I liked it, it was an interesting version. I never thought that I'd see Kate Beckingsale playing Alice. It was funny how her hair kept changing with like every scene."
__label__1,not so good: the product was rather stale upon arrival and not very good. probably a good idea not to purchase these
__label__1,Olympus W-10 Digital Voice recordwe: The ad. did not indicate that this products digital camera only worked with Windows and not MAC. All of our computers are MAC and so the product had to be returned.
__label__2,Brilliant: Brilliant brilliant brilliant. I just wished it was longer. It's like Black Books crossed with Jane Eyre. Gothic and hilarious.
__label__2,"Feliway diffuser: This is a good product. It has a subtle but noticeable calming effect on male, female, young, and older cats. It's available at this site for considerably less than at our local pet stores. For litter box training we used Kitten Attract and Cat Attract kitty litters (purchased from our local pet store). We had adult cats and brought feral kittens into our home because the shelters were filled. The Feliway and special litters were a great help. We continue to use them to keep things consistent and everyone happy."
__label__1,"Very disappointing: I adore Miss Rice's ""The Witching Hour"" and so curled up for what I thought would be an equally good read. What a disappointment. The writing is quite banal, and unlike some of her other writings you never get the opportunity to know the characters in any depth. I was so disappointed that I didn't finish the book, which is rare for me."
__label__2,good replacement speakers good sound: good replacement sound much better than oem i do recomend these... sound much better with aftermarket stereo... good for the price
__label__2,"Great Item: I had got this for about 6 mounths now, and it works great. but the little speeker that comes with it is not the greatest. the looks that people give me r priceless! the ice cream man, and the P.A. works the best."
__label__2,"Very Good image and Audio...a little pricey, but that's Sony: This is a very good camera. It's definately a point and shoot camera. There are other shooting options you can explore. I bought a wide-angle conversion. (Standard lens is just too narrow for me). I also bought an external mic and light. Both are very helpful and add a little extra edge to the camera.I wish new MiniDVs were not so streamlined, lacking manual controls, headphone jacks etc. Older models certainly had more to offer.Overall, this camera does just great for capturing family moments."
__label__2,Super All Write: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this drive for the price. It met all my burning needs on a tight budget and was just as good (if not better) then the Plextor drive it replaced.
__label__2,Comes in handy.: Purchased this for my children here at home and for my childrens church class. It has 3 different suggestions crafts for each topic. Very detailed on what you need and what to do.
__label__2,"FROM ENTREPRENEUR TO HAPPY INFOPRENEUR: There are many books which offer instruction on how to increase your effectiveness as an entrepreneur. Stephanie Chandler has created one specifically for those who are knowledge providers and information brokers. She includes everything from the use of newsletters, e-zines, e-books, teleseminars, and speaking engagements. All of which are discussed in great detail to teach you how to build and maximize your profits. It's a must have book for infopreneurs in all industries."
__label__2,"New Favorite Toy: I purchased this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. He has so much fun watching the car race around the house! I was worried about the car being small, but it is a pretty large car great side for a toddler. Great fun for my little Cars fan!"
__label__1,"If I could give this minus 5 stars, I'd give it a minus 10: This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre there. Not only do the characters not look anything like they should, but George C. Scott pretending to be British??? Please, give me a break!!! Run, don't walk, as far away from this version as possible."
__label__1,"Great for 3 month: The mouse worked great for 3 month (5 Stars for those 3 month), then the left click stopped working properly, it would register 1 out of 10 clicks which makes it extremely frustrating to use. I've tried to use a different USB port for the receiver, reinstall driver, move all wireless devices away from the mouse, tried it on a different PC, but still no worky. For a premium mouse this is unacceptable and not being able to left click renders the mouse useless (1 Star). The Mouse is cover by warranty, and Logitech is suppose to send me a new one (+1 star) but if that one breaks in 3 month then this will be the last time I buy a Logitech mouse."
__label__2,Very close to orginal: Very close to orginal. Color is off some what. And it comes with attaching clips. Used for a 1976 Pontiac TA.
__label__2,"I heard this song bite on Coast to Coast Am (Host: George Knapp): Re: Back Street Crawler: First CD - the one that has 'Long Way Down To The Top' On It.I thought that it might have been Bad Company at first or Brian Eno from Roxy Music) but then I did a bit of research and found the review online and I'm seaching for the CD now as I don't have credit to buy it online but hope to get it in my collection soon. Awesome lyrics and the sound stucture is awesome too. Actually first time that I had ever heard of the band but if these things are not available anymore at least the songs are online so they can be heard by most everyone. Love that song called ""Long Way Down To The Top"". These need to be reissued ASAP. Probably can only be found/heard in Vegas but it's online also since George Knapp lives in Vegas, his not so humble hometown of sin and sex as he says in his spiel on Coast to Coast"
__label__1,"Pay a little more and invest in quality kick pads: I've been training Muay Thai for about 4 months now. The pads are beginning to rip at the sides. I understand that the impact of the kicks will punish the pads quite a bit, but, I don't see these pads lasting for more than a year. I would recommend investing another 40-50 bucks for some quality leather pads."
__label__2,"Excellent: Written by a prominent figure of Chinese-Americans, this is a definite read for anyone interested in a real perspective of immigrant life in the U.S."
__label__1,"No parts, No service, hard to locate for assistance: After several HOURS trying to find who owned Pollenex, Holmes Group slipped me a number to Conair 800-528-9384 where they said parts aren't available, but she did replace my DM209-0303BN head at no charge. I must return the defective unit.All for a 39 cent ""o"" ring with a flange. (Mine had only a half a flange which caused the head to malfunction when turned to a different nozzle.Don't lose that number!\KNFKearney, NE"
__label__2,"If you have a child who loves to jump, buy this!: We bought this for our 9 month old son (8 months old when we bought it). He LOVES his ""jump and go"". He has jumped in it daily now for about six weeks.Things we love:1. He has never pinched his fingers or bumped his head.2. We found the assembly to be really easy.3. Easy to move around the house. We previously had the Johnny Jump Up which was impossible for me to move. This one is much easier and is also great for taking with us when we visit others. Much less bulky than trying to take along the excersaucer.I would highly recommend this if your child loves to jump!"
__label__2,"Classic: Janis is one of the very best, if not the best singer songwriters. These recordings represent some of the best vocals and songwriting of those times. She's full of emotion and beauty. You must buy this!"
__label__1,"*yawn*: It's obvious that Simple Plan is primarily aiming for the younger teens with this. At least I hope they are. The lead singer is not very good, and his voice may grate on your nerves. People bash Avril because they say she is a poser. Avril's never said she's putting out punk music. These guys believe they're punk....they aren't. Still, if you like sugar-coated, trl/radio friendly pop...with the tiniest breath of punk in it, then by all means, you can't go wrong here. If you want real punk rock, go with AFI. I would also like to urge you to check out KILL HANNAH, a little known band whose cd is coming out sometime next month."
__label__1,Professional Trim Carpenter: I have been a full-time finish carpenter for the last seven year's. I was hopeful that I would pick up some useful tidbit from the book. I learned absolutely nothing new. I guess this was a novice book.
__label__1,"Dissapointing. Do not expect too much from this cd.: This is not what you expect from a soundtrack to star wars by john williams. He doesn't use many themes he should have used (the force theme, yoda's theme, and what about an imperial march leitmotiv in anakin's theme?) at least in a leitmotiv form. He tries unsuccesfully to make another musical universe. Mr Williams: You failed miserably!"
__label__1,"Cute story: This is story of two people wounded by scandal, and the way they struggle to live their life to the fullest. Rosaleen Fleming is considered amoral by inheritance since her mother is a former courtesan, while Lucien St. Cyr tries to conceal a family scandal. They meet and despite the ruthless gossipers they become close friends. Then, a serial killer emerges, murdering former courtesans after sending them a letter of warning. Both Rosaleen and her mother receives these letters, and it becomes urgent to locate the killer.I find the story entertaining, and the murder case is quite original. But, the book will not be one of my favourites due to the characters. They continue to be strangers throughout the book, and some of their actions don't seem to correspond with the characters they are supposed to be. All in all, an easy read that is soon forgotten."
__label__1,boring: read sporkdude's review. he tells no lie about this game. (except for the dead corpses part lol)
__label__2,"Beautiful: Love this movie! Although sometimes romance takes a detour, this is a beautiful love story and a very enjoyable movie."
__label__1,"Not a good thing: I was initially pleased to find an olive oil based soap for sale, but this was a profound disappointment. I tried it on my hands when it arrived. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It is strongly (!) perfumed and smells like cheap cologne.It cleans perfectly well, but my hands were left feeling stretched and dry, later itchy with a film on them. The itch subsided after I washed again with my usual soap. It is possible that I am sensitive to cheap cologne, but who would imagine an olive oil based soap would smell so horrible? It says in the description that it is a ""fresh, herbal green scent"", but not so.Be warned. If you don't want to smell like that, don't buy this soap. It's not cheap in price, unfortunately."
__label__1,"Horendous read.: Maybe it's me and maybe but this is one of the worst books I ever read. I guess it just doesn't stand up to the standard of books I read, which is usually sci-fi, horror or fantasy. My usually authors are: Brian Lumley, Dean Koontz, Piers Anthony, John Varley."
__label__2,"good but could be more mathematical: I like this book 'bout being very concise and detailed about the various synthesis processes, but a bit more mathemtics could get some of my curiosities fulfilled. The theory is excellent and understanding the different synthesis types is a breeze; the flowcharts are intuitive and diagrams are detailed. I love the presentation of each topic, and the humour of the author while reading it. A great starting point for music technology enthusiasts but no advice on programming synths or using advanced software like reaktor, so it could be more expansive on some perfomance and programming areas. Overall great reading value."
__label__2,"Excellent bottle!: I work as a mother baby nurse and have attended many breastfeeding classes. I purchased these bottles knowing that I would have to both breast and bottlefeed. These seemed like the closest nipple on the market to the breast shape. My baby had no problems going back and forth. I could even see her ""latching"" on to the nipple in similar fashion as she would when she nursed. The natural latch nipples are excellent. The breast milk storage kit is also a plus. The drop in liners will attach directly to a medela pump with the converter ring. My baby has never seemed gassy or spit up. You can feel confident that they are taking in less air once you ""burp"" the liner. As a healthcare professional and a mom I would definitely recommend this product."
__label__2,"Generally Quite Pleased: I've had this phone system for about 3 years now. I am generally quite pleased with it. I find the sound quality good and the system fairly easy to use/navigate. My only issue right now is that the numbers on two of our peripheral units are wearing off to the point that they are becoming illegible. I have 4 satellite units along with the base unit, which handles our home needs and my business needs quite nicely."
__label__2,Another good game...: I played the demo for this game and it was good. the main person in the game is Tidus (but you can name him any way you want). the battle system is cool. and when you sumon a monster instead for the sumon doing just 1 attack (like FF7) the sumon stays in the battle(the sumon does go away when it dies). but once again the cussing kept me from giving it a 5. the graphics are very good. the miny games (like Blitz ball) are fun but they can get fustrating. over all it's a fun game.
__label__2,"Informative; a must read for any 21st century family.: Mr. Sabatini cuts through the Y2K mystery with a straightforward and easy reading guide for the entire family. After reading this book, you and your family will be as knowledgable as any computer nerd regarding the Y2K enigma. Way to go, Don! Keep up the pro-family approach to simplifying seemingly complex social issues. I look forward to reading your next book."
__label__1,"I didn't like this book very much: I had high hopes for this book but it disappointed me! It was too wordy and hard to understand and I came away feeling like I had learned nothing and had no answers. I didn't like the way he ""humanized"" God."
__label__2,"Exciting: This book is amazing. Easy to understand, and it gets right to the point. The detailed drawings help to understand in a visual sense. Would definitely read more from this Dr/author."
__label__2,"stunning book: This stunning comapnion book is a must for all King Tut fans. We JUST returned from the exhibit in Dallas, Texas (Dallas Museum of Art). Missed it in LA in 1978, but was NOT going to let this exhibit get away.Fabulous book....."
__label__2,"Logitech Quickcam Fusion: I love this web cam! I love how it tracks me if I'm moving around. I love how it can zoom out to include someone who has come into the room. Can it take great pictures? Not really--but that's not why I bought it. What it can take are great little videos. It is so neat to be able to send video messages without having to take out the camcorder. I totally enjoy the feature where you become the avatar. It takes a little work to sync it up with your movements, but it's worth it. This is especially nice to have if you are not appropriately dressed, or dressed at all. I wish all our friends had one."
__label__2,"The Hurricane: I believe this is really a great movie and it was a true story as it was told.I watched it and yaped it on a VHS,but I have to admit it better on DVD.It is a movie that keeps your attention through out the complete movie."
__label__1,"Two orders, two returns: I've ordered this phone twice as a gift for my parents, and I've had to return it twice. The first time for Christmas 2011, the phone was missing the handset. It finally became in stock again, so I ordered another one for them, and this time the numbers do not work. So you get a dial tone on the phone, but nothing happens when you hit the numbers. We've tried switching the pulse/tone buttons on the back, but it appears that the buttons just are not connected to the phone or something."
__label__2,"A good gift for the young or young at heart: I bought this for my daughter because she used to watch this movie over and over again when she was growing up. She loves it still at 40. The Blu-Ray is her choice for movies now, so I was glad to find this format."
__label__1,"WORST BUY EVER: This is the single worst thing I've ever bought on ecom. It fell apart the FIRST time I used it - it is made VERY cheaply. Even before it fell apart I noticed that it was very rickety. If you are using it for anything other than just a stand-alone hamper, and you want to actually use it to roll your hamper to the laundry machines, do NOT buy this product. It is a waste of money. Mine is currently covered in duct tape and I'm planning on throwing it away as soon as I get a new one."
__label__2,"Written in: The book was very entertaining, but some of the clues were written in the book by the previous owner. I guess that is what I get for buying used."
__label__2,"Sanus Low Profile Wall Mount for 55"" flat screen: Good heavy duty product with all mounting bolts & washers in separate bags by size: made it easy to match up with the mount holes. The biggest washers, however, should have had smaller holes, closer to the bolt size. They were able to shift too easily (a minor thing).Easy for two people to lift the TV and hook the TV mount hardware onto the wall mount hardware.After mounting, the ability to slide the TV left & right a big plus.Would definitely recommend this product. Plenty strong for a 55"" TV."
__label__1,"Christians: I thought that the receipes in the book were ok. I haven't tried all of them. I believe I misunderstood the book itself before buying it. I thought that most of it would be receipes but it was mainly a devotional through food. Not, what I expected."
__label__2,"Everyone made at least one of the Big Money Mistakes: When it comes to money we do strange things that are not logical at all. For example, how many times did we hear somebody paying over 20% of interest on a credit card debt and at the same time hoarding cash in a savings account that earns us 1%? We probably heard this numerous times. The author does a great job describing all the little things that we do with our money that makes absolutely no sense. No matter how smart we are, this book makes us look in the mirror and realizes how illogical we are about some of our money decisions. I highly recommend this book.Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

__label__2,"Just recieved my vacuum: Hey all :) Just got the vacuum in the mail this morning. Unpacked really easy and assembly was a snap :) Other reviewers were right, it is almost self-propelled! It is a bit heavy, but managable for this little lady. Went from carpet to bare floor really easy. It picks up stuff well and the hose and attachments works great. The air smells good too after vacuuming, like clean! The pedal recline button is a bit tough... but once you get the hang of it it is better and seems quite simple. The hose is quite stretchy and reaches well with the attachments. And yes it takes a bit of effort to snap in the attachments, but it isn't too bad. I would give this 4 1/2 stars so far. Very nice!"
__label__1,"Begrudging: I have never read a book by Fern Michaels, and I have no intentions of reading another book by her!I decided to buy this narrative because the story line grabbed my attention. But, the author failed to deliver a good story.IT'S STUPID!!! I really wish writers would put more time and effort into their projects. There is no way she tried to put her best effort into this story. IT'S TOO STUPID!!!"
__label__1,"The Art of Simulation Using PSpice: I have read this book, and found that the first four chapters are good describing the syntax, as well as the basic circuit simulation. Other chapters are fairly easy to understand and worthy for beginers. However, this book do not describe much or provide you a good chapter with examples about CMOS circuits simulation, except 3 pages about CMOS in the appendix G. This book would be great if the author revises and adds some things such as editing symbols, converting subcircuits into symbols..."
__label__1,"Ridiculous: Mr. Gore obviously has not taken into account an accurate - and unbiased - view of the scientificic evideince on the subject. I would write more, but it is a waste of time given Mr. Gore's obvious policical, and frankly inadequatate and misleading, perspective on the subject... Ridiculous and not worth your hard-earned money. If you would like more objective, and entertaining, information I suggest ""State of Fear"" by Michael Crichton."

__label__2,"WAS IT ASSIGNED AS HOMEWORK?: After reading many of the reviews, I find that all the readers who absolutely abhorred this book HAD to read it due to some assignment by an instructor. This is too funny. I was not assigned it, therefore I loved it. I am trying to catch up on my classics and am happy to say that this book is one of my favorites. Is Tess an insult to women?

In some parts, like getting the coins and letters C,T and R it is harder though. If you want to find a shortcut to this game, and any other game, go to gamesages.com This is a very fun game!!"
__label__1,"I don't get it: I agree with others who find the premise of the book interesting. However, I couldn't help thinking while reading this book that the author was creating the story line as she went along. In my opinion the plot is quite haphazard, with arbitrary meaningless subplots, pointless plot contrivances, and no real sense of closure at the end. If it's meant to be a prolonged ""slice of life"" type of story, then it's not a very good one. I forced myself to listen to the entire book in the hopes of discovering the magic which is keeping it on the bestseller lists. A complete letdown."
__label__1,"Good story, ""notes"" ruin the Kindle edition: A very good story, mostly ruined by bizarre embedded ""notes"" by the author. The notes are almost universally uninteresting and completely disrupt the flow of reading the book. While I can strongly recommend the story, the Kindle version is to be avoided."
__label__1,Huh?: Who came up with this concept? It had to have been someone studying marketing strategy and not someone who is a yogi or a fan of the fitness ball. I felt awkward during this workout. It did not make me burn calories (unless you count the giggles as I rolled around).
__label__2,"Must-Read: This book was the absolute best book I've ever read. It is a story of a boy who travels to Paris but retells his childhood. I found it hard to understand at first, but as I read on, I understood every word of it. I think this is a great book for all students who are my age, 12. It is an excellent read. A mixture of tragedy and romance and will touch your heart."
__label__2,"CHARGE...: Don't blink or you will miss something. Let's see, that's how many bodies? It had been a long time since I last saw this movie, I had forgotten just how funny Cary Grant can be. This is a wonderful, fast and hilarious movie. You can almost see the smoke rising from the top of Cary Grant's head as he tries to keep up with his two bouncing Aunts and an Uncle that loves to blow his trumpet, no matter what hour, a new bride that doesn't know what to think. I would have loved to see this cast do the stage version. What can I say, it is one laugh after another from start to finish."

__label__1,"AWFUL REMAKE: I think Mario Lanza is the greatest tenor that ever lived, & ""The Student Prince"" was his greatest album. Unfortunately, THIS ISN'T IT!!!! This is Mario Lanza SINGS SONGS FROM ""The Student Prince""!!!!! If you want the real thing, you need to find it on Vinyl or cassette. It is the actual movie soundtrack, & it has a picture on the fron of Lanza dressed as the prince, presumably taken before he was fired from the film. On this version, some songs are left off, the ones included sound totally different, & it doesn't even sound like Mario Lanza's voice!!! To be blunt, this is AWFUL!!!!! If you truly want to hear Mario Lanza at his best & performing his crowning achievement, I suggest doing what I resorted to: Get the aforementioned vinyl or cassette & burn it to a disc. I CAN NOT, IN GOOD FAITH, RECCOMEND THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

__label__1,"Very Dull: This book had all of the markings of a good true story, but it was written more like a diary, and not a very interesting one at that. A lot of it did not ring true."
__label__1,"What happened to this once great band?: if you hoped that ""soft bulletin"" was a one-time excursion into the realm of crappy, you were mistaken. once my favorite band, i now disown them. what happened? i guess it happens to most bands that stay together for a long enough time. wayne has obviously decided that it's more important to be original than it is to play good music. i only pray that the test of time will have this band remembered for the GREAT albums they did produce and not this fluf.(for great albums see: ""a preist driven ambulance"", ""hit to death in the future head"", ""transmissions from the satalite heart"", ""clouds taste metalic"" and ""oh my gawd"")"
__label__2,"A zen story superbly filmed as a sci-fi thriller with good creative ideas, action and cinematography: When most sci-fi action movies lost themselves in stunning CG, visuals and actions, the director and writer of this had made it right for telling a time travel story brilliantly with intelligent screenplay, great acting (especially Levitt, who you can tell he had, with a little help of make up, styled himself into young Willis perfectly), and most importantly an excellent plot (and ending) with solid details. The quality of the creative ideas, action and cinematograhy are high, yet the quantity may not be enough to satisfy some heavy action movie fans who got the wrong expection from the trailer and of Bruce Willis. No matter what, a very good movie which captivates the audience from the beginning to the end. Highly recommended!"
__label__1,"Toshiba usually reliable, not in this case: My positive experiences with Toshiba in the past is what lead me to purchase this specific brand DVD player. My family and I went on two vacations within the last month and this was purchased for my children to watch their movies during the plane rides. Immediately out of the box the DVD player functioned very loudly when loading a DVD, making a grinding/grunting noise. It did have a beautiful picture on the LCD screen, however. The player only lasted about 3 weeks and stopped working during our return flights from our second vacation. It didn't even last one month! I would avoid purchasing this item again because, even when working, it took forever to load DVD's and was very loud when doing so. Not to mention that if you have problems with the unit, you have to send it to Toshiba for service and cannot return it to the vendor you purchase if from, which is a significant inconvenience."
__label__1,Long story: This movie is pretty long and it drags in spots. The movie is definitely okay but certainly not great. Not quite what I expected.
__label__2,"fun movie....: This was a really fun movie, and brought back so many high school memories. Even with the zany characters, it had a firm insight to some real teen issues, and stressers of the day in the life of a teenage high-school girl. LL was perfect for this part; characters were very well cast."
__label__2,"By far one of the BEST little people sets!!!: I bought this set used last fall for my son (now 17 months). (FYI it is so expensive new due to the fact it has been discontinued for a while). This is by far one of the best little people sets! the ship looks great and is EXTREMELY durable!!! the cannon fires a canon ball out of it (My son quickly learned little people fit in it as well and can be fired from the ship!) It is great!!! He plays with it for hours everyday, and I expect it to last a long time! If you are considering buying this ship (whether new or used) BUY IT!!! It is so much better than the junky new toys fisher price's little people have been introducing the past few months. I miss all the older cool sets like these!!!"
__label__2,"damage feels good: This album is a masterpiece, with only a few duds. ""Six Pack"", ""Damaged 2"", ""Rise Above"" and ""TV Party"" are hardcore anthems, and mental illness gets a treatment with ""Depression"" and ""Room 13"". Not for Blink 182 fans."
__label__2,"Rock On Mr. Daughtry!!!!!: It just goes to show you that you don't need to win a contest to become a true winner. I have waited for this day to come, because this is What I Want!!!!.

__label__2,Very Useful: I use custard cups all the time to pre-pour all the ingregiants for baking and cooking so they will be ready when I need to add them. I saw these cups as an addition to these. They are crockery and are the perfect size and the color is very pretty. The only down side I can think of is they proved to be a little bit heavier than I expected. I us them regularly and overall am pleased with the purchase.
__label__1,"Yup - it's Propaganda, all right.: This isn't entirely uninteresting, but reading it is something of a slog. It was written, largely, as a sales brochure for one of the early developers of public relations as a business tool. Without teaching the mechanics of public relations, it does go into some detail about the possible uses of a PR firm, strongly selling the benefits of having good PR.Public Relations has, since this was written, grown into a major industry. Those interested in the history of this industry are likely to be the readers who enjoy this book the most."
__label__1,If you need more bottles to store milk it is a waste of mone: I bought these for I needed more bottles to store freezer breastmilk. If you are going to use them also for feeding I found the nipples to flow to quickly for my little one. I used a different bottle for feeding and wish I would have gotten nestmom.com website before purchasing as I got their mother milkmate storage system for 27.00. It includes 10 5oz bottles and a handy rack for the freezer keeping oldest milk in front. The 27 also includes shipping - The bottles fit on both medela and ameda breast pumps. It is well worth the money and wish I hadn't bought the medela bottles as they are no longer being used.

So beware...these vendor employees who pack and ship the orders are completely ignorant about film aspect. Good luck getting a true widescreen disc."

__label__2,"Best Buy: I chose this collar because it had the metal buckle. It is worth every penny. The collar I had for my Cocker previous to this one had a plastic clasp. I put her collar on one morning and ""pop"" went the prong that was supposed to slide in the plastic buckle. The plastic buckle is not durable or reliable. If I had been out walking my dog and the collar had broken both of us would have been in a bad situation. I'm in a wheelchair. Her daily walks are near busy residential streets. A broken collar would have scared the heck out of both of us. The metal buckle on this collar is very sturdy and I can't see how it could break anywhere. If you need a new collar for your dog this is the most reliable at a reasonable cost."
__label__1,"Was not what was advertised.: I was looking for a bigger collar for my dog so he couldn't get to his foot. The dimensions that they listed on the site were much larger than what actually came, even though the sticker on the product said it was extra large. also it did not look like the picture. It did not have the nice rubber on the outside rim. It was wavy on the rim which made even more spots the dog could get past. When I tald the company about the issues they said I could return it for a refund but considering I paid $10 for the product and $5 for shipping I didn't think it would be worth sipping it back for another $5 just to break even maybe."
__label__2,"Review For YOU!: What a strange, goofy band. I suppose that's exactley what I love about'em. That and their amusing lyrics. Cynical. Piercing. Volatile. Socialy inept. Ah, a pleasant mix of quackiness and true musicianship. Buy this album. No! Buy'em all."

The filter works very well and replacement filters are very reasonable. With the use of a BPA free bottle, I'm able to refill without the worry of bacterial growth. Since I carry a water bottle with me everywhere, this has been economical and Green. Glad I got this filter, I did a lot of searching and read reviews that helped me decide on this one."

__label__2,"Very Stylish Necklace and Pendant: I am very happy with this purchase. It is just as pictured, and the shiny pendant contrasts nicely with the mesh look of the chain. I have also worn the pendant on a black cord. FYI the pendant is not flat, it is convex so does not lay perfectly flat on clothes. I would order silver again from ecom."
__label__1,"Ryan's Revenge: A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean."

__label__1,"Not A Good Product At All: I bought this as a gift for a friend who was envious of my similar pasta pot. I didn't know what kind I had (should have looked) but I saw this one on ecom and it looked identical to mine so I bought it. It turns out that you cannot cook pasta in the strainer ... it boils over and makes a mess. You can only cook pasta in the pot and use the strainer as a collander to drain the pasta after it's cooked ... you definitely cannot leave the strainer in the pot and then simply lift it out when the pasta is ready. If you don't mind this inconvenience, then the product is all right. But if you want it to function as a pasta pot is supposed to, then you will be sorely disappointed."
__label__2,"If you want your feet WARM in the winter, this is the slipper for you: I like the Ascots I got a couple of years ago, but these Tasmans are really shaping up to be quite warm and durable. They fit a bit tighter than the loafer style Tasman, which keeps your foot warmer. They also have a driver's bottom on them, so you can wear them outside if you want. You don't have to wear socks with them, because the sheepskin naturally keeps your foot dry and smelling okay. Great shoes, if you are ordering get them in the size of the Uggs classic you wear.Rebecca Kyle, September 2009"
__label__1,"Good for diving only...: The watch hands are virtually indistinguishable at night, making it a poor choice. Good dive features, but I found the dive mode would automatically enter if I went jogging (sweat will activate it). It also goes into dive mode in the shower...not a good design. There ought to be some way of telling the watch, ""I'm at the ocean, NOW you can start dive mode.""If you want a watch ONLY for diving, this is a good choice. Otherwise, steer clear!"
__label__1,"Disappointing!: I like Jazz... I like country... I like Norah Jones and have been waiting for a new album to come out... but the best way to sum up this effort is disappointing. Listening to this collection of songs, it's hard not to expect the polished smoothness that Norah and the Handsome Band has produced in the past but gone is the silky ""Norah Jones"" piano as well as the emotional feeling of the ""Handsome Band"". The recording is billed as friends who love to create together but the chemistry is all wrong. Some of the electric guitar work is good but Norah's playing is choppy and labored and the rhythm without feeling. Mix in the warbled crooning of Richard Julian and you have an amateurish night club act.Borrow the CD from your local library. That way you won't have to sell it in two weeks when you're tired of it."

This guy is trying to make a killing out of the fact that he committed crimes and then went to jail for them and that makes him a hero? Who is he joking? He's a lousy criminal, he got caught, he went to jail, end of story. I have heard from people far more connected to Whitey Bulger than this low level drug dealer that he was anything but the tough guy in Bulger's mob that he tries to create in this ridiculous book. All he is trying to do is prove he is still a man. After wasting my money on this silly book, I still remain unconvinced. Don't even think of buying this pathetic book."

They sent me one of his songs, which, on my own, eventually led me to discovering this album. Fans of reggae MUST check this out. He sings in both German and english, but mostly German. Good beats, and you get used to his distinct vocals quickly. Reggae fans, CHECK THIS OUT. SERIOUSLY."
__label__1,"Promise of book 1 dies horrible agonizing death.: The first book in this trilogy started well with interesting charecters, new ideas for motivating the protagonist, and at least a semi-original plot tool. Every ounce of potential is ruined by this second book. Both the hero and villain become as one dimensional as the paper they are printed on. All characters in the book become both blindingly intuitive and amazingly dense depending on what the author needed for an outcome in a given scene. Someone who can spot a certain trap from miles off in one scene mindlessly falls victim to a second trap in another. The unique plot tool is used once to achieve something that could have been profound or at least interesting but the way the scene is contrived to use it is so ludicrous that it spoils the effect. One can hope that her next book will avoid these pitfalls but this one is doomed to garage sales and remainder piles."

May The Horse Be With You? Gag. And the worst by far: I'm Lion-O. How shallow and simplistic do you have to be to write a song about a crappy cartoon like Thundercats? I wouldn't believe anyone had done such a thing, except I heard it with my own ears. Don't even THINK about using the word PUNK to refer to this band.

__label__2,"Very good but not great: Based on the blink-182 pedigree of the band's key members, my expectations were very high for the first release by +44. After several plays, ""When Your Heart Stops Beating"" didn't meet the level of what I had hoped +44 would produce. It's certainly worthwhile to buy and there is a recognizable progression from the final blink CD, but there just doesn't seem to be anything noteworthy on it that stands out."

__label__1,"Pretentious Tripe: My first warning signal of the immature, whiny self-love fest that is this album was reading the song titles.... there's something a little too haughty about having a paragraph-long song title, and the graphic designer must of been tearing his/her hair out trying to squash those inane titles into the space of the back of a cd.IN short, this entire band personified: A poor little rich boy who practically lives at Starbucks,drinking $5 coffees, collecting ""save Darfur"" and ""Free Tibet"" etc rubber armbands for the fashion and talking about how much he hates George Bush for no specific reason. In short, self-absorbed shallow kids with barely any experience outside the range of their cellphone reception.If this description does not apply to you, don't bother."
__label__1,"Carpool: Carpool was disappointing. I am not thrilled with Ms. Kallmaker's character choices. Why? They offer no ethnic diversity. Why, what do you mean? One of the main characters is Asian...surely this is an effort at diversity in Karin's writing? True, but, frankly, she could just as well have been a Black lesbian...perhaps the HARDER choice for Ms. Kallmaker who is probably aware that a large percentage of her audience consists of white lesbians. It seems that the lives and the presences of black lesbians are never treated in any of Ms. Kallmaker's writings...except for a minor appearance by some big breasted, Mammie-type,women's shelter worker in Touchwood...whom the lead character, Rayanne Germaine, promptly wanted suckling or something from...okay? Plantation flash-back... Anyhoos, Carpool was a let-down."
__label__1,Shelly from Montana: I had to write more! The reader who said this was alot like Susan Elizabeth Phillips Nobody's Baby But Mine couldn't be more wrong. I have read all of SEP's books and none of them are about the occult(ie witches). Nobody's Baby was a great book but had absoultly no witchcraft of any kind in it. Nora always writes a great romance and the romance in this one is good it just crosses the line trying to make us think good things about the occult.

I enjoyed the entire movie and soundtrack, but do wish the soundtrack would've included a few more of the songs from the movie. That said, the ""Blow"" soundtrack is up there with ""Carlito's Way"" when it comes to my favorite 70's based movie soundtracks. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys 70's rock."
__label__2,"A la Découverte du Petit Prince: A la Découverte du Petit Prince is an excellent book because it gives background information about this wonderful tale by Antoine de Saint Exupéry. It is also an excellent tool for those who want to make progress in French as well as in the knowledge of "" Le petit Prince "".... who would be 65 years old ! ! since this book was published in New York, for the first time in 1943, at a time when Antoine de Saint Exupery was living in the USA.Congratulation for the bookWith best regardsBertrand OGERAU - SOLACROUP( a French Historian, author and publisher )"
__label__1,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: I did not like this book mainly because it was very hard to follow. Especially if you put it down for a couple of days and then started reading again. It was hard to figure out which character I was previously reading about. I did not like the book.
__label__2,"By George, it's Booth: Lee Lorenz has indeed captured the essential George Booth. Not only has he given Booth's adoring fans a beautiful collection of his work, he introduces us to the sources of his brilliance - his smart, talented, humorous, proudly individualistic parents - and he spices the book with just the right number and types of Boothianic stories to make us yearn for more. This is a rare find."
__label__2,"""Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks' Best Work"": The widescreen edition, although set at only 1.85, is a big improvement over the laserdisc or tape. The chemistry of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, and newcomer Terri Garr is quite magical. In addition, the supplementary features on the disc, such as the many deleted scenes, bloopers, and interview with Gene Wilder, make this DVD a real keeper for lovers of the movie."
__label__2,"Collection of Truly Moving Stories: A collection of truly moving stories from the women of Haiti. With excellent introductions to the historical context, these narratives are poignant and challenging. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in the people of Haiti."
__label__1,"Not for beginners: The recipes all sound appetizing, but you will need time, patience, and skill to implement them. As a working woman, I can't say this book has been at all useful."
__label__2,"Ditto--Great Phone: Kudos for this phone!The Micro SD included fills up pretty quickly, where about tweleve songs filled it up. The micro SD comes with an SD adapter and I bought an SD/USB adapter at CompUSA for about $10.00 and they work great, just like any another expandable memory stick. Songs loaded on the Micro SD need to be placed in the Media folder or the phone won't recognize them.Battery is good considering what the phone does. I purchased a back-up battery for $30.00 plus S+Tax but the phone didn't recognize it and wouldn't work. So I returned it and bought an original battery for about $35.00 plus, and it works great! Better than the one that came with the phone, although they both work fine.The phone functions work fine, pretty standard stuff."
__label__2,It was an extremely disturbing but great movie!: I expected a different movie but none like the one I saw. Jonathan Demme should win some award for reality. It was hard to follow until it all tied together three quarters the way through the movie it took my breath away and at some points I had to pause it so I could breath again. It was one of my favorites and one of my least favorites all in the same movie.
__label__1,"not so much fun!!: We love the Cranium games at our home...we have several, however, this one fell short as far as we are concerned. The kids simply found it boring and enjoyed throwing the bouncing balls rather than playing the game. We'll stick too some of the other cranium games."

__label__2,"U2 Saves Rock and Roll: It's this simple, listen to the album on surround sound and hear the power and the glory of the rock and roll spirit. This album will be remembered as not only a premier U2 album but also the album that resurrected and saved rock and roll. It is a masterpiece. Rock and roll is more than about how good an album or song is compared to past or present tastes. It is about moving the soul and the spirt to the beat of the drums and and the rhythm of the guitar (or the chiming glory of The Edge). More than the sensous voice of Bono, these songs move the heart, they take the spirit to the highest ground. Buy it and enjoy it. Savor it, you won't regret it."
__label__2,"Better each time: Mama Mia took us by surprise. What are these other-than-musical actors doing headlining a musical.The characters were great. The actors fit the characters.

__label__1,"Seduced By Boredom: I really do not see the fuss about this book. I can not believe the undeserved 5 ratings posted against it. First of all, if you want a regency romance in its truest form, then please be warned.I felt like the author should not have bothered with the 'supposed' regency setting. She could have changed a few atticles of the time ('clothes','carriage to car' etc) and passed it off as a relatively modern setting.The language. I felt like I was reading a modern novel NOT a period novel.The plot must be given some credit (grudgingly).Some of the dialogue was amusing albeit out of place for that period.One reader says, the mystery was hard to figure out, well thats wrong.I have read A LOT of historical romances' and this does not even earn a place amongst the worst i have read.True hitorical romance readers, be warned, if you want something forgettable and something in place of a sleeping pill, then please by all means, borrow this from a local library but do not buy it."
__label__2,The Philips DVP3140 DVD Player: This is an outstanding DVD player for budget installations and represents a value that is hard to beat. I was able to connect the unit and play commercial DVDs from Netflix without any problems. It is very small but its size belies its capability. The unit plays many formats that many costlier ones cannot. At $39.00 it cannot be beat.
__label__1,"Un-American: This is one of the more sickeningly anti-American movies i have ever seen. And at a time when service members are at war and dying and really need the country's support. Is there nothing these ""celebrities"" aren't willing to defile to put money in their pockets? They should all be ashamed."
__label__2,"mia yes, woody no: what i got out of this book (and the included court decision, which lent great credibility to ms. farrow's narrative, is that mr. allen is a very sick man who has no business being around young children. it certainly made a mockery of that scene of his in Manhattan with michael murphy and the skeleton where he talks about his personal integrity, modeling himself after God, and being well thought of by future generations. ms. farrow deserves a lot of credit for believing the children and standing by them. (a little girl who locks herself in the bathroom or screams for the rest of the family to hide her when she sees her father coming is not fantasizing)."

If you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing, it is luke-cold! I was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave! It is hard to clean and very loud!"

__label__2,"Honey, I have to go the west coast with an old man.: Some of the reviewers have missed the point. This is a book about THE BRAIN, but also about age, life, dreams, and continuity. It's a neat little book that says more than it says. and means more than it says. A great gift, and a thought provoking ride across a country and time."
__label__1,Crossing Paths: I considered it very elementary and definitely incomplete It just barely touched on the lines in the hand. I considered it a complete waste of money.
__label__1,"Running out of steam: Weather Report released two self-titled albums in their career -- their classic 1971 debut, and this 1982 album. The latter is the last recording of the most popular Weather Report lineup -- Zawinul, Shorter, Pastorius and Erskine. Much like its predecessor, Night Passage, this one sounds like a very competent, professional band that's out of fresh ideas and rehashes old ones. There are the same tight, third-world grooves with layered synthesizers and floating saxophone, but you've heard it all before and the tunes aren't especially memorable. (""Volcano for Hire"" is pretty cool nonetheless.) It's safe to skip this one unless you're a completist or raging Night Passage fan; and even if you are, you should probably jump ahead to 1983's superior Procession.[This review is based on the 1990 release, not the recent reissue. I do not know whether the new version has superior sound quality, but it does have an identical tracklist.]"
__label__1,"Wonderful Idea Turned Movie Mistake: Gattaca. Wonderful idea turned terrible movie mistake. While the basic idea nad theme of Gattaca are spectacular, this film has a very poor plot, and so so acting. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman do not shine in this movie sa they have so many others. This film grows old quickly. Half-way through the film you are bored to tears, by two-thirds through you want your money back. What happened with this movie?"
__label__1,Don't Waste Your Money: Don't waste your money on the filter or the Keurig Coffee Maker. I was using fresh ground french roast coffee and after brewing all I had was a cup of weak tastless coffee. I returned both the filter and Keurig Coffee Maker. I'm now back to using my 4 cup drip coffee pot and enjoying a strong cup of coffee.
__label__1,C H Lightoller: Save your money and get Titanic Voyager the updated version never mind the fact he updated it twice.A waste of money I wish I had known this.
__label__2,"Amazingly Easy: I was never good at cooking in any way, shape, or form. I set out to find a book to learn how to cook, and I found this one.This book makes cooking amazingly easy. From the very beginning, it presents the most important aspects of cooking and delineates what cooking utensils are essential and what the different forms of cooking are (broiling, steaming, grilling, etc.). The recipes provided are simple and easy to understand and follow; they also produce food that is absolutely delicious. Recipes are accompanied by suggested modifications and tips for shopping and preparing.This is the perfect book for learning how to cook. I highly recommend it to anyone, particularly those who are like I was, knowing nothing about cooking."
__label__1,Waste of Money: I dont like this DVD at all..all the cast is just so boring and its kinda worth waste of money
__label__1,"fair: Now I see whyUnforgivenand the Eastwood work actor and director since is rightly considered such a renaissance. Heartbreak Ridge encapsluates every negative stereoype about Eastwood that saddled him before 1992 when Unforgiven arrivedEastwood acting is fine here as a hard boiled marine, but the writing is cliche, you could be watching a Chuck Norris flick. The serviceman encounters the hippy and the new gaurd officer, all with predicible sarcasim. So what.Eastwood had done far more nuanced work before--Dirty Harry and a lot of the Leone westerns--and it is disappointing to see the master working so far below his capacity.But also kind of fun. Seeing this now shows you how much Eastwood redefined homself in the 1990s, making morally complex films that define him as one of the best in cinema."
__label__2,"Excellent foundation text: While the material is highly technical, it is presented in a clear, concise manner with excellent end of chapter summaries.Substantial amounts of background information are presented to ensure a thorough understanding of the physiology of some body systems in order to permit a better understanding of how some medications work. Minimal molecular biology is included. Personally, I liked this text and will be keeping my copy for years to come."
__label__1,"Overhyped, overdrawn and overdone: [...] This book was awful. I've read and enjoyed her erotica ebooks so I took a chance and bought this one. Boy, was I surprised. Way too many characters and too many species to keep track of. Hawk was annoying and whiny and she was too much liike the Kim Harrison character for me to care what happened to her. The end was incomplete and overdone. (How many epilogues can you have). Everyone seems determined to out do the Anita Blake novels. What if they just tried to write their own book?"
__label__2,The Best: I use this in my classroom. Adults are the only ones allowed to use it! It sharpens quickly and accurately.
__label__2,"A fun children's book!: My kids love this book, and I love to read it to them. They really enjoy the active imagination that Skippyjon has; I really enjoy that it exposes them to Spanish. Our oldest has actually started branching out into other Spanish-language titles. Our 2 year old just loves the drawings. A fun book for the whole family!I agree with the previous reviewer that a knowledge of Spanish is helpful. The only minus I would give the book is that it would be nice to have a pronounciation guide at the back for the Spanish words."
__label__1,"Disappointing: I bought this handbook because the series had a terrific guide to Nova Scotia which I had obtained for an earlier trip there. That was not true of the Montreal and Quebec version. It was much less complete than the competition from Frommers in every way, from local history to places to stay and eat, and organized in a very confusing manner. Go with Frommers."
__label__1,"Binocs okay, warranty sucks: The binoculars were decent when they worked. They were clear enough, so-so at low light conditions and the 12x brought things in very close. They are advertised as having a ""rubber armor"" coating. ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! I was carrying them out to my car with a hand full of other stuff and they dropped about 3 feet to the ground. Didn't think anything of it until I went to look through them the next day. I WAS SEEING DOUBLE. That tiny little fall killed them. Figured they'd be covered under warranty. NOPE, they offered to sell me another pair at a slight discount because the price to repair was more than a new one. I told them to keep them. Why would I want another pair of crap binoculars? I ended up spending a little more on a lower end NIKON and I haven't looked back. The NIKON's are way better!! I'll never buy another Bushnell based on my experience. There's enough good stuff out there by better companies that I don't need to deal with them ever again."
__label__2,"ONLY ONE GOOD SONG: Lobster & Scrimp was the only good song on this album. It is an extremely good song, though, and it makes this album all worth it. This song is a must have, but don't buy it, record it off a friend."
__label__2,Oral Irrigator: I use this for traveling and it does a fairly good job. It isn't as powerful as plug in models but it is lightweight and portable. I think it is much better than not using one when away from home.
__label__1,"The ought to be a law against movies like this: The movie was just horrible. What a piece of dumpster material!I liked the original version better. But there is nothing like the book. So, go and read/buy the book my friend.The soundtrack is horrible too. Did they use to many drugs or something?But I want to be fair. The title song: ""Lost Horizon"", was played (instrumental) later by the London Philarmonic Orchestra. Yes the 1973 version! And that is a real masterpiece. I have this particular theme in an old compilation and after 30 years I cannot get over this excellent production."
__label__1,"Only for die hard zombie fans: You should only get this movie if you are a die hard zombie fan or a library completion. The movie over all was bad, but i have seen worse. there was very little gore and blood for being a zombie movie, and make up on some zombies was almost non existent. The acting was ok, but at times it seemed like dialogue was missing, and i really thought that there should have been more emotional moments especially when the friends die.SpoilersSpoilersSpoilersThe ending is bad, i mean really bad..the island is broadcasting a do not come here message but no one in the plane picks it up...in the end everyone would have just been better off staying where they was eating pop rocks and playing video games, and just living out there life in an uber mansion bachelor pad. Really poor ending...really poor."
__label__2,"Profound and Practical Insights: Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov is an important figure in the Western spiritual resurrgence, but is not that well known in the US.He was born in Bulgaria, became a disciple of the saintly Peter Deunov, and spent almost fifty years teaching a form of esoteric Christianity in France. His works also contain much from the Hindu and Kabbalistic traditionsThis book, like all of his others is a series of transcripts of lectures: he never wrote any books himself, and so there is occasionally some repetition, but if anything it helps to focus and clarify some of his points.Many of his insights are extremely profound but also very practical. I have found a lot of interesting material in each one of his books, but this remains a favorite.This book is well worth a look if you are interested in expanding your spiritual horizons and learning more about empowering yourself and your life."
__label__1,Did Not Work - defective download - ecom refunded purchase price: This worked until about half way through and froze and I could not see the end of the movie. ecom refunded the purchase price.
__label__2,"Almost perfect! Just one complaint...: I watched this series on Netflix, and enjoyed it immensely... so much so that I wanted to see the bonus material that is on the DVD (and not on Netflix).I do have one complaint: the segment on Tibet makes it sound if everything is now oh-so-wonderful in that Himalayan region. If it is so delightful, then why do the Tibetan refugees (including the Dalai Lama), now located in India, not move back to Tibet? Why are Tibetan monks in that region setting themselves on fire to protest the current situation? Were the documentary's producers ""guided"" to a pro-Chinese stance (perhaps as a condition for filming in that region)? If so, the objectivity of this travelogue is questionable at best."
__label__1,Lose this book beneath the layer: This book is suffering from massive technical and terminological problems. There are simply too many to begin to list them. It's like the Naval Institute Proceedings meets the Ladies' Home Journal...and loses. It's riddled with errors fore and aft. I reached a point of discouragement where I simply couldn't read another word. I give it one star for effort...not a good effort.
__label__2,"Good topo program, compatible with other software: Allows you to export tif images with GIS/CAD world files for easy upload into Programs such as Petra. Downside is that if you are looking at a large area, you have to continuously change out disks (there are 5 or 6 of them)."
__label__1,"Unwatchable: This is a great concert, but as others have said, the frenetic camera work and syncing problems make it virtually unwatchable. It makes me almost nauseous to watch something where the camera jumps around so often, and there's really no point bearing the irritation if, when you actually get to see someone play something, it's not even in sync with the audio.Considering you can get this whole set on the excellent ""Exposures: In Retrospect and Denial"" compilation, there's really no reason to have the DVD version unless you're a hardcore fan and love having concert DVDs."

__label__1,Worst coffee maker ever: Bad design results in more coffee on the counter than in the carafe. What a waste! Very unhappy with this purchase.
__label__1,"Disappointing debut: With a great title and subject, it's too bad Bajwa couldn't turn out a novel of greater interest and skill. Ramchand, the main character, is just not interesting enough to carry the weight of the story, and his central perspective limits the story's range. Her most believable characters were the middle-class ladies; they could have appeared more prominently. Her upper-class belles were soap-opera concoctions. A Fine Balance, The Namesake and Brick Lane all have far more merit."

__label__1,"Works great while it works: I'm on S9 #3. My first unit worked perfectly for 3 months or so until the control buttons quit working properly, and instead the unit would skip tracks or adjust the volume randomly on it's own.Contacted Motorola support, which in itself was a bit of a hassle over the phone (I'd recommend dealing with Motorola via the web / email if possible). But once I finally got ahold of the correct person, they didn't question the replacement - which makes me think this is a common problem.Unit #2 was sent out. It worked fine for about a week. Then the same problem started happening again. Replied to my original ticket, got an RMA number and am now getting a 3rd unit.Have had to pay return shipping both times, and am beginning to be frustrated with the situation. Hoping this unit will hold up, but I expect that because I use this unit when working out, somehow moisture gets into the controls somehow and is what causes it to fail.We'll see how long unit #3 lasts."

__label__2,"PRETTY DOG-GONE GOOD!!!!!: Dennis Lehane has another good one in Scared. My only complaint is the book was a little to long. It had about 70 more pages than last one. I think some of the talking could have been left out, the action woudl have moved quicker and it would have been better, but then what do I know? Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are their usual wise cracking selves. Trevor Stone hires them to find his daughter, or does he want her found? Kenzie and Gennaro go from Boston to Florida and back again. People are getting killed all aroung them but the somehow come through it alive. Being shot at, car wrecks, being buried alive, gased, all just in a days work for these two. The ending is very good, I liked what they did. Hope they can hold it together now that they are lovers. Really liked it better when they were just best of friends. I would suggest reading this series in order if you read it. It will be much better."

Sure, these books contain tough subjects, but that makes it all the more real. Lurlene shows you a side of the world that not many people see.

These lyrics are like the little book of cliches and nobody does anything really good with their instruments.

Not.If you want a good metal/rap band check out Faith No More. They were ten years ago! They did this before it was trendy!"

The stylus is like a plastic tooth pick and I think this company was being just a little too ambitious thinking they could make an organizer this small and make it reliable. I decided to spend more money to buy a real PDA and splurged on the Handspring Visor Platinum. You might want to consider the same move."
__label__1,"Certainly Different: After a first listen of this album, it's very clear that they sound different, well, not in a good way. It was as if I was listening to a different band, again, not in a good way.To sum up this album, it was like 80's pop band trying with rock elements while blinded. Sound is boring. Despite bitter criticism about their first album, I think they had a good thing going with their sound and voices created a good harmony that no other bands were not capable of. Rather than buidling on their foundation, they decided that they wanted a different foundation, and it's very weak. Guiter driven sound does not match the voices of 3 singers. By the way, harmony of these singers are not good either. Everything is a mismatch. I was hopeful, but very disappointed with their desparate attempt to sound more ""rock."" It just didn't work for me."
__label__1,"not thrilled: While I often love Oprah's picks, this one just isn't doing it for me. Way too much gratuitous sex (and I am not one to mind a good sex scene in a book), I feel written down to as a reader, as if everything need not only be told but then explained as well. Overall, skip it unless you tend to like adequately written (at best) historical novels that smack of romance novels."
__label__1,"STAY AWAY!!!!!: The product arrived in a damaged box. I tried the processor in two computers and the same problem occurred in both. Wasted most of a week giving the seller the benefit of doubt, wrong decision. Apparently someone else returned the product and it was resold based on the looks of the packaging. Overall a bad decision to purchase from the seller and ecom. Bought local at better price for a faster processor. Buying local in the future and not on line. In 20 years of PC experience this was one of the worst. Don't buy here."
__label__1,"Blade was unusable: I saw the other reviews and bought this blade to cut travertine tile. While the blade I received was not visibly damaged, it certainly did not cut as expected. The first strange thing I noticed was that the width of the cut was substantially wider than the saw blade which is, I assume, due to the slots cut into the blade. The width of the cut, while disappointing, was not a major issue however. The real issue was that at the end of the cut, the blade consistently left an 1/8"" little knob of tile on one side. This made the blade unusable. I ended up going to a local tile supply store and found a truly continuous rim blade and replaced this blade with it."
__label__2,Works well: The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
__label__1,"Died After Warranty.: When I first used the Visor Deluxe I was impressed with it and had no problems but after 1 yr. 5 months on my last Hot Synced I now have a very ... paper weight, now after looking at the Handspring web site it will cost you ($$$) to talk to them and if they have to fix it it will cost you ($$$), now I have just looked and I can buy a Palm 105m for ($$$) and the only thing I will lose is the springboard which to me is no big deal, but of course maybe I will go back to the tried a true way of the old Day Planner, at least with that the only thing that will break is the pencil."
__label__2,"Colon Health Key to Vibrant Life: This book saved my life! (NO JOKE)At the time I found this book, my colon had been completely shut down and badly impacted. I arrived for a colonic shaking with a high fever and dizzy (I was toxic). I could barely see. After having my first colonic and seeing what came out, blew my mind! I left feeling full of energy, the fever was GONE, I felt GREAT! I had lost 10 pounds with my first colonic!I refer back to Dr. Walker's books on a regular basis...but this is the gem of all his books! He certainly knew enough to live well over 100 (I think he was 127) and he died in his sleep.Don't wait until your are sick...look in your phone book under colonics and make an appointment today! After your first colonic, you too will be a beliver."

It has not been released on Blu-ray: I would love to own a copy of Blu-ray NEMO, but the problem is, it has not even been released yet!!How can u guys rate the formats of this movie?For some of us here, we are after the formats of the movie, not the story lines ...ecom, please do something."
__label__2,Merriam Webster's Legal Secretaries Handbook: The book was in excellent shape when I received it. I am most pleased with the quick delivery of the product. I would recommend this seller to others.
__label__2,"Best Whey Money Can Buy: Excellent stuff. I am using On's 100% whey since about a year now and I highly recommend this product. Esp, the double rich chololate tastes like heaven, easily mixes with milk/water and leaves no stomach bloating etc. This product on ecom is a bargain and you should not let go. Get the 10 pound box and save $30. This is great stuff, if you want to grow, get this ASAP."
__label__1,"Telling the ending first ruins the story: David Ellis attempts to use a different approach to the telling of this story. He begins at the end. But once the cat is out of the bag, there is nothing left of this tale. It could have been an interesting mystery told if told chronologically, but in this manner it was tedious. The confusion is in trying to remember how something was told - was it during another conversation? Was it by the narrator? And with only two people on the audio, it was sometimes difficult to tell the difference between the characters.I was also not very keen on the abridgement version either. The dialogue was trite, the setting non-existant, and the characters stiff and without life. It could have been partly the fault of the voices, but most of the blame belongs on the writing.Very poor effort and barely good enough to finish."
__label__2,"Excellent value for what it costs: I'll make it quick. The ring is made of tungsten carbide with zirconium nitride coating... ZrN is HARD! It's almost as hard as tungsten carbide. While the coating isn't bullet proof or impossible to scratch, it's damn close. I've grabbed metal poles and bumped into hard metals without a scratch. It's much better than having a gold/titanium/platinum ring, as they are more expensive and more likely to scratch. I love this ring. I'm about to buy another just just in case something crazy happens."
__label__1,93 or 66 lumens of brilliant white light?: I found this light on Smith & Wessons site and there it states this light delivering 66 lumens of brilliant white light. ecom says 93 lumens. I was going to buy this light untill I seen this conflict.I own the Smith & Wesson Galaxy 13 LED Flashlight (10 White LED & 3 Red LED) and so far it has been working great for an led light.
__label__2,Best baking book: I had been using this baking book for years. Bought mine 10 years ago for its traditional recipes. my nephew and his new wife bought a house and she wanted to learn more on cooking. I bought her bothe the baking and cookbook. it is a great set for cooks of all levels. it has real meals not the oversized portions of most recipe books. the recipes are laid out well. hope they enjoy theirs as much as I have mine.

__label__2,"It's Disturbed...What more is there to say..: I have been listening to Disturbed for more than a few years now (long enough to pass the love on to my son)And I was not disappointed with this CD. They are still killer.The songs are still raw and full of feeling...what more can I say, they rock."
__label__1,"There's got to be something better....: I was really disappointed in this text. It was required for my wound care class; I did not find it helpful at all. There were only a few color pictures in the front of the book. I feel that they could have been at least put in with the section or chapter that they were illustrating. Also, several of the practices and methods written about in here are out of date and are therefore no longer apply. Reading the text and then going to lectures was sometimes confusing because of the conflicting information. So many things have changed in wound care since this book was last updated. I certainly would not recommend this text."
__label__2,Great for infants: I bought this toy for my friends twins who were turning 1 and they love it. Even the dog loved to play with it. I totally recommend it for young children.
__label__2,"6 Stars!!!!: WOW!!! This is about the best 4 short erotic stories I've read! Lora Leigh's is actually the least of the 4. So if you like Leigh, imagine 3 stories even better than hers! Awesome! All are very well-written, and the editing and publishing are very well done, too, for once. King and O'Clare's stories are terribly sweet, romantic werewolf tales. Sex, yes, but love and romance, too! Yay! My only complaint is that the stories were too short! I wanted more, more, more!!!"
__label__1,"deceptive advertising: This vendor's ad does not state what the size is of the product that you are ordering, and when the product arrives, it is half the size of the (same brand)comparable priced product."
__label__2,"Love it but have a playing issue: I love the series. It's very laid back and very good to relax to. A slice of life anime through and through. That being said, I am having an issue playing disc four through six. I originally started watching this through netflix and noticed that the fourth disc would not be played at all using all sorts of programs including vlc, totem, wmp and a few others. I thought maybe their disc was faulty and ended up buying the box set (still worth it) and am still having the same issues. All the other discs play find but the fourth through sixth. The discs are pristine and have no defects. Has anyone else run into this issue?"
__label__2,"AIMEE, PLEASE MARRY ME: this album came out at a particularly strange part of my life. i am a depressed person and see n feel a lot of her pain and anguish about just life. after seeing her in interviews and in concert, why any guy would mistreat this beautiful woman (inside and out) is beyond me. may her future be happier than her past. amen"
__label__2,practical and easy way to relieve common ailments: I work at a computer all day and I find the neck/back tension and headache section to be really useful. I even do the pressure points at my desk and they go a long way in helping prevent headaches. I've also used the cold/flu points as well. It really helped relieve sinus pressure that I had. Amazingly simple things to do to not have to deal with drug side effects like the dryness of antihistimines.
__label__1,"Horrible sound: This is not a good phone. The functions are not pleasant to use and the sound is just horrible. There is a an echo, I even asked my husband sevaral time if he was listening to my conversation as it sounded like the second phone was also in use.I gave it two months and I am ready to bring it back!"

__label__2,"Makes you think.: The documentary certainly looks down on the subjects. The rave guy who acts like he knows so much, actually is so clueless he doesnt know the name of the date rape drug. The research by the members of the church is horrible. The film is gritty (both in subject and lighting) and some scenes had no relevence (dating & football matches?) Watching the film a few things popped into my mind 1) where is the scene with the abortion doctor murderer. 2)I hope none of the people ever get raped or depressed. Arogance at it's best"
__label__2,"Entertaining and Thought Provoking: Ayn Rand masterfully mixes provoking thoughts with an entertaining story. You would never believe it upon looking at the book, but you'll be sorry when you reach the last page. And don't worry, nobody ever reads all of John Gault's speech!"
__label__2,"projection alarm/temp clock: This is an ok product. Compared to the competition, it does not have features that allow rotating the image on the ceiling unless you turn the device itself. It also displays the temp, then the time, while the competition displays both. However, the competition clocks do not seem to last more than a year without some malfunction. These clocks are more reliable."
__label__1,"Laboriously drawn-out for a book so loosely structured.: Naipaul overdid it with this 500+ page book that wanders through snippets of countless stories, but never dwells long enough in any of them. The book is valuable for the slices of East Indian life revealed, but its charm wore off halfway through. I would recommend looking elsewhere for Indian material. A novel would have continuity of plot and character, whereas this had only the continuity of pulling the rug out from underneath the reader again and again"
__label__1,"Very Little Value: This DVD ranks as the number one worst DVD's I have ever seen. Not only was it a poorly made home video, it had very little informative travel or cultural information. It completely lacked substance. What you get is some guy walking around filming the day as it progresses while he courts his internet bride. There were MANY awkward moments where anyone that is a seasoned traveler felt sorry for the participants. You basically have to sit through someone elses boring home made video with no substance just to see his trip from his perspective. Suggestion: Save your money and buy a Travel Guide and just go there."
__label__1,"Loud and obnoxious: My son likes this thing well enough, but it unmercifully has no off button. Nothing like accidentally tripping over it in the night and waking the whole house up. It's really loud and annoying. After a couple of weeks you'll hate it. But your kid won't."

__label__1,"Color Staining!: Hi-I purchased the black color. At first these were great and comfy, but this past week all of the sudden I took them off and my legs were black from the excess dye on the inner shearling material. I also tried wiping some dust off of the surface of the suede with just a normal white towel and (I didn't even rub hard) as a result, the towel turned black. I am not sure what to do at this point, it is such a hassle to send the product back but I am unfortunately very dissatisfied at least with the black color I chose. Maybe the manufacturerer should perform colorfastness testing prior to releasing these items in the market. Is there a way to rectify this at this point? Any recommendations would be very helpful. Thank you-"

__label__1,"Don't buy Kindle Edition!: AGAIN! It's unbelievable to me that ecom charges almost the same for the Kindle edition of a book's hard copy price! Why?! Any cookbook or other reference book on Kindle is horrible to navigate! Recipes that require to go elsewhere in the book with a reference like "" go to page 286"". ecom needs to get their collective act together or they will loose heavy users of the Kindle for cookbooks, etc, and will take our business elsewhere when the competion starts to use dynamic links for their reference books! DONT BUY THIS BOOK!"
__label__2,"Very enjoyable: Saw this one in the theater, and purchased the DVD as soon as it was released.I don't know what many other reviewers were looking for, but this movie does not pretend to be a 'Finding Nemo' -it does have its moral -which is to be comfortable with who you are. Simple enough. The graphics and animation are very well done and show state of the art -as always, each year this kind of thing gets better than before.I saw it in the theater, so I knew what I was getting. I purchased it as soon as it was available -what else can you say about a movie?"
__label__1,YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE A DOG!: The most horrific part of this book was what Cindy did to that poor animal. People like her don't deserve to have a dog. People like her also need an editor when they attempt to write a book. I hope I never find out she has pets again because I would report her to the Humane Society in a minute!
__label__1,Overpriced!: I was very dissapointed when this book came and there was a large sticker saying $2.99 on it. I paid $4.99 and it only has 80 pages!
__label__2,"Awesome resource for tips on the finer points of the game: I used to read these ""comic strip"" formatted tips in Baseball Weekly, and I thought they were awesome. I have watched and played baseball for years (even attending baseball summer camp), but I learned some great tips from almost every strip. I liked them so much that I started cutting out the strips and putting them in a photo album. I wanted to save them for my kids to read some day. Unfortunately, I only had about 30 tips saved. I was ecstatic when I saw that they were putting all of the tips into a book."
__label__1,"Mediocre: This book is only 260 pages but it took me forever to finish it. Two boys, Brian and Gregory, are caught up in a strange game while visiting an uncle. They have adventures and meet strange creatures. Even now I cannot really remember or understand what the point of the game was. The boys' characters were very undeveloped. I had a hard time remembering which boy was which -- they seemed interchangable. The great ""ah hah!"" at the end was -- underwhelming. Anderson was aiming at a gothic and sinister atmosphere but Spiderwick Chronicles and of course Lemony Snicket do it better. I am glad some kids liked the book but there is better stuff out there for fantasy readers."
__label__2,"Every Pastor Should Read This Book: I had seen it happening, but Mel described the situation and its implications perfectly: the evangelical movement and the fundamentalist movement have divorced, and the fundamentalists believe ""we're right, and if you're not with us, you're not heaven-bound.""Folks in the pews on Sunday mornings don't understand the situation or the implications, so pastors must!"
__label__2,"Fast, can't put it down read: The is my first Gina Gray but it won't be my last! I had to put the book down and have a good hard cry. Anyone with a father will relate to the lead woman.

__label__1,"a disapointment; everything BUT well refined: The author's effort into writing this book may have been extensive; however, i found it to be completely lacking in fact on all levels. The book seems to be a compilation of his inner ""ramblings"". Of which, he did not put on paper very clearly. Furthermore, he disrespects his own religion and misrepresents the accuracy and authenticity of Holy Scripture. More importantly He blasphamies the Almighty God be insinuating several things such as ""God needed Abraham"". note to the author - The Almighty needs nothing. He is all."
__label__2,"time-pass: This one is a quick read. Its funny and the author has placed some witty one-liners here and there. But overall, this is not a remarkable piece of writing. You can even predict whats going to happen. It appears to be more suited as one long blog entry of a 20-something manhattanite with a liberal arts degree out there trying to find a job and a boy friend. Its a nice book if you want something to read during your three hours long flight. I enjoyed this book!"
__label__2,"Not just a Flash in the pan: For the novice, this book will guide you through the basics and give you an idea of what can be achieved with Flash 5. I actually managed to read the whole book without once turning to the program (yeah, I know it's sacrilege).There are some errors (what book doesn't have them) but on the whole it's the perfect book to get you going, especially if you delve deeper with their other books concerning more advanced features, ie. ActionScript.It's thick but not stupid, well-written but a little dry at times. I've got other Flash books, and although I tend to buy PeachPit Press books, I didn't go their way when it came to Flash."
__label__2,The myths of Osteoporosis: I think this is a good book for all woman to read I was only 34 when I found out I had osteoporosis.
__label__1,"unimpressed: I was unimpressed. The coloring is subtle but not outstanding. The violence is gratuitously visible (when it shows something it shows a little more wnated violence than I want). The story wasn't compelling or completely clear, or engrossing for me."
__label__2,"Don't let the title fool you.: This Cd is one of the best jazz Cd's Ive bought. Tom Scott's cover of "" Love Will Lead You Back"" is one of the best covers of a song I've heard in a very long time. The highly underated Lisa Fischer gives a spectacular vocal performance of "" Way Past Goodbye"". The entire CD is rated A-1 from beginning to end."
__label__1,"Too broad and lacks depth: This is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision. This book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction. Unfortunately, there isn't any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines, any one of which would be a volume in itself. I was very dissappointed and I find the other reviews misleading."
__label__1,"Didn't bother finishing this one: I enjoyed Phillipa Gregory's other novels. So, I was quite disappointed with this one. The main character is simply detestable, but not in a way that kept me reading further than the incestuous lust. Yuck, no thanks."
__label__2,My Favorite Movie of All Time: I love this movie. I grew up on it and it is my favorite. There are so many classic lines in the movie that my brothers and I say to each other. And I love a movie with a happy ending!
__label__1,"not notified, out of stock: I placed my order and had to contact the company to see why it had not arrived after a couple weeks of waiting. They emailed me back that it was currently not available but I had recieved no notice prior to my making contact with them. It was frustrating. I cancelled the order & re-ordered from someone else."
__label__2,"Excellent Guide: Becky Bee's Cob Builder's Handbook is well written in plain, understandable language which even the most basic beginners can clearly understand. Her illustrations are equally clear. There is no doubt that anyone who is interested in building with cob can follow the steps in this book and enjoy a reasonable degree of success. Hopefully, future editions might include more ideas for house layouts and more photos of completed projects. That would bring it up to 5 stars!"
__label__1,"Some definite glitches: Cons: The price is dropping on this thing weekly. I'm using it on an brand-spanking-new Thinkpad under XP, and recording is a buggy disaster (among other things). CreativeLabs hasn't been timely in their responses to bug reports, so it's unclear if the hw is broken or not. Even if it's not, untimely response to real support requests isn't encouraging. I'm actually trying to use the product for real things. The software bundle is definitely light for the current price (notably, lack of a DVD player).Pros: There are many high end products which use USB. Yes, I would love it if they all used firewire, but precious few seem to. 24/96 is real, and extigy's price is cheap compared to certain other offerings (unfortunately, there may be a real reason why the price is less - see above).Over time extigy might be a real contender."
__label__2,"TOO BAD ABOUT "" TOO BAD "" !!: This CD features outstanding reproduction of the original soundtrack. However, I was very disappointed because my favorite song "" Too Bad "" has a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ORCHESTRAL ARRANGEMENT lacking the wonderful vitality and rapid rhythm of the original, when the performers break into dance. Why wasn't the original version of this song included on the disc, even if they had to lift it from the film? Goodness knows they included every other possible alternate for everything else !Evidently other reviewers are quite happy with this disc and possibly don't even notice this song is an alternate (and yes, it does indicate that on the liner notes, so I should have prepared myself for disappointment !)Otherwise, an exemplary CD for all the other material."
__label__2,"What are you listening to? That music is Garbage!: All hail Shirley Manson! This CD is awsome. Not many of the songs are fast, but you can't help but love every track. Every time I put it on to listen to one song, I can't help but listen to all of them. Each one is unique. All of my friends are sick and tired of listening to it because when I put in a CD, chances are that its going to be Garbage."
__label__2,"Barrington's Book Extremely Helpful: I've been through this book twice, highlighting and underlining the many useful phrases and tips. The emphasis is not only on the practical but also on the artful. Some chapters cover practical topics, such as finding the desired form and the difference between memoir and autobiography. Others offer ways to make the narrative more interesting by moving around in time and making the language more vivid by using one's senses. One chapter deals with the nitty problems of telling the truth in light of other peoples' sensibilities, and, when it comes to painful subjects, the difference between ""wallowing"" and ""bearing witness."" The author has included exercises as illustrations at the end of every chapter. I intend to read the book yet again before I start my memoir."
__label__2,A great song by a great singer: this is a great song that has a great sound to it Jessica simpson proves that just like on her other single I think I in love That she will be around in ten or even twenty years from now unlike her other those other teen singers. so if you enjoy Jessica Simpson Then you should buy this single now it is agreat song to dance to I bought it myself and I played it for a friend Of mine who is more into rock than pop but even he admitted that he like the song and he can not stop singing the song he even said he was goona buy this single so there the proof if a rocker can enjoy this song so can any pop lover.don;t just sit there buy this single now you won;t regret it.

It was fine the first month, but as the temperature rose, the belts that go around the headrests broke or melted.

I was very surprised by how quickly it didn't last and the fact that my dog really didn't have any time to do the damage."

__label__2,"Flawless: Although I know more than a little about classical music, I had never heard of George Ritchie. The comprehensive booklet enclosed with this set gives a full biography of this organist, who is regarded as one of today's foremost interpreters of Bach's organ music.The organs used are modern organs in several US cities, each built in the spirit of the best European historical instruments. The technical aspects of these modern digital recordings are flawless, and Ritchie displays excellent technique.There are many excellent box sets of Bach's organ music. I also have the box set performed by Walcha, who was one of Ritchie's teachers. The Walcha set was recorded for DGG Archive in the late 1950's and early 1960's. Both of these sets are certainly worthy of serious consideration."
__label__2,"Go Ahead, Punk. Make My Day: Yeah, I know it's not Dirty Harry but at the time Eastwood made this film he was making the Dirty Harry pictures too. And there is a similarity to this and the DH films. His character has the same attitude and motivation for what he does and who he does it too. I was never a big fan of westerns, but I have always like Clint Eastwood. And it doesn't matter if its a western, sci-fi, action/adventure that he's in I have always enjoyed his movies. This is no different. Even though it's a western, and not a spaghetti western that he is known for but an honest to goodness western, it's a good movie. I recommend this to anyone who likes either western or Clint Eastwood movies."

__label__2,"This DVD was beautiful!: I have never written a review here but I feel it is important to let people know how wonderful this dvd was for us! I was never a Glenn Beck fan until I watched this dvd & now I cannot wait to buy his other recent books & dvd's.What an unbelievable change I see in Glenn Beck! This is most definitely the work of God alone. But, this dvd will appeal to anyone!He is such a magnificent person at heart. I literally cried while watching this dvd as it was trul honest & heartwarming.Anyone needing to be uplifted or see truth should watch this.It was of great encouragement to me.I am now enjoying watching him on Fox News. I am not a Fox new person but I wait on 5 PM here daily now just to see what Glenn has to say.Now, I hear his show is coming to an end?How sad...Anyway, this is great for christians, catholics, mormons, any faith out there...or anyone who loves OR hates Glenn Beck.All I can say is thankyou Glenn Beck! I am on my way to purchase your books now."
__label__2,"GREAT!: I am not a TOS reader, but I found this book really exciting! It is by far the best Star Trek book I've ever read. The pace was ideal. There weren't unnecessary details. Everything was straight to the point. I really recommend this book."
__label__2,"An Overlooked Classic!: This is one of the best in the Metal Massacre series.The songs by Voivod,Omen,Metal Church,Overkill, and Fates Warning were only available on this compilation, which is worth the price of admission alone.The other tracks are fair,but is mainly worth it for these.If you're a fan of old school power metal, I suggest you get this one or better yet get the Metal Massacre Box set titled""Grim Harvest"" which includes all 12 volumes.Unfortunately the box set is not available on ecom,but you can get it on Metal Blade Records web site.Metal Lives On!"
__label__1,"Good luck with the movie, Crichton!: I've come to expect much more of Crichton than this screenplay he has written. I found it boring. Does anyone else get tired of his explaining the too complicated techie stuff to some inane character? This time is was the assistant; usually it's some precocious child. And what about that assistant? Didn't know what to do with him at the end? So, you made him a drug dealer (no hint of that in the rest of the book). This book stunk"
__label__2,"His Best Album!: All I can say is those other reviews are off base and those folks are nuts! This is Elton's best album by far. It rocks and has the coolest quality about it. You would have to hear it to understand. His most gorgeous and moving song he ever wrote is on this album - ""We all fall in love sometimes"". The music and creativity is amazing. DO YOURSELF a FAVOR and get this now! One of my favorite albums ever recorded!!"
__label__1,"2 stars.: To escape the infamy wrought by her best selling workout novel- Workout Sex, A Girl's Guide to Home Fitness, Alexandra Clark (Sexy Lexy) fled to a small town. Hiding her prettiness as best she could under a dowdy exterior, she set out to create a new life, running a small inn in a town with no library or bookstore. However, Sam Worth wants to change that, and is working to build a new library, although one man is determined to stop him. Like Lexy, he has secrets he'd just as soon keep hidden. As soon as Lexy and Sam see each other, an inevitable slide towards one another begins. Yet, if they learn each other's secret, will their relationship be doomed? Can Lexy hide behind her plain Jane disguise forever? Though the improbable set up and contrived plot strains credibility, the author does make a point about how the any secret can cast a pall over one's life and limit your possibilities."

__label__1,"Too Bad Big Foot Didn't Steal this Book Before I Read it!: This collection of short stories fell very short of my expectations. Granted I had never heard of Joan Hess but the praise for Joan Hess reviews on the back all claimed she was an extremely funny writer so hence that is what I expected. Humour however is not contained within this novel, it is not that her jokes or comedy scenes weren't funny, it is just that they do not exist at all. This book is a B grade thriller but certainly not a humorous collection of stories. The quality of those stories as thrillers is also rather average. The stories are predictable and many an effort to stick with as well. Give this book a miss!"
__label__1,"Neat idea: So we ordered 3 of these for the garden because we were having trouble with squirrels stealing tomatoes. We kept moving them around, but the squirrels got wise within a week and they are more decoration than a functional deterrant. One did have a little bit of trouble sealing the fill plug shut, but it's a decoy not a pool float and if it's not inflated to the point of popping its not an issue.Neat idea, just didn't work for us. No bird issues, but the squirrels kept taking tomatoes so early the birds didn't really have a chance. I was concerned they'd blow away but they stay put nicely due to the S-shape that they make (a snake-like squiggle)."
__label__1,"A disappointment: This was my first Julia London and I had high expectations- the excerpt suggested unbelievable angst as a man kills his best friend in an inexplicable duel. But the book never measured up - the characters didn't make sense. The supposedly smart and unconventional heroine behaves very immaturely. The supposedly smart and dangerous gentleman, can makes lots of money, but can't solve the mystery of his own birth. The characters simply were not consistent and therefore not very engaging. I kept reading because I curious about the mysteries Ms. London was at such great pains to suggest. About half way through, my interest picked up when I thought I saw that a supposedly minor character was the major villian, only to be disappointed with the ending."
__label__1,Nonsensical: This doesn't even try to tie any of the statements it makes (without evidence) the majority of the film together in any coherent way.
__label__2,"B5'S CD...: I personally enjoyed listenig to the cd, with the different varieties of songs and topics. These 5 boys are very talented, and I think that they choose the perfect songs to show off that talent. With their sharp dance moves and their handle over all the ladies, these 5 hearthrobs are sure to be the next big thing. I really like the song ""Heartbreak"", and songs like ""Nothin Bout Me"", ""U don't Know"", and many others, deal with real life issues that I think a teen boy experiences. They have wonderful voices, wonderful talent, and I think that P-Diddy did a wonderful job with them."

__label__2,"What Goes Around Comes Around: I, like so many other blind sheep, dismissed the Atkins plan for many years. I did so because of all the alarmist propaganda put out by the Medical Establishment that this diet was ""dangerous"". I believed them even though I had solid evidence to the contrary. Back in 1972, a high school friend who was grossly overweight went on the Atkins diet. Before my eyes, he took off 80 lbs - and kept it off! For thirty years! No ill effects! In short, it was just propaganda by the Medical Establishment, and now the truth is finally coming out. Fortunately, Dr. Atkins, like Mahatma Gandhi, stuck to his guns and has never yielded grounds to the hyenas who tried to discredit him."
__label__2,"Another Hit by Maxted: I fell in love with Anna Maxted novels after reading Getting Over it, Running in Heels, and Behaving Like Adults.A Tale of Two Sisters is a novel about two Jewish sisters Lizbet and Cassie growing up in London and dealing problems related to trying to get pregnant.The main plot of this book is about about pregnancy,adoption, the people you will always love, and those you fall out of love with.I started this book on a Saturday morning and didn't put it down until that night, a definite read!"

But I compared this with my old crappy antenna (10 years old, $5) with one pole broken. My old crappy antenna(supposed to receive the regular air programs, not High Definition TV) performs better than this one! So I suggest you use your current antenna first, if it works just fine, you don't need to buy this one :) It's not as good as you expected."

The people were thirsting for moreand now they have got it! Stories from all the heroes andvillians were brought into a new life. This book is just aperfect example of this. In the Legends Trilogy parts ofTanis and Flint's past was discussed, but the true story wasnever told. Mark Anthony and Ellen Porath have told astory that would be Flint's liking. They put the peices ofTanis's relationship with his family and his love for Laurana.Also Flint and how he came to know Tanis and the theSpeaker of the Suns. Finally they gave the elves a cultureand class that had not been reveiled. But with that cultureit showed the dark side that the elves have. I wouldreccomend this book to any Dragonlance reader"
__label__1,"This is Sony?: I brought these earbuds because the ones that came with my iPod hurt my ears after a while. I needed something that would fit in my ears comfortabley. After reading the reviews I decided to go with these.For me, these are very comfortable as they give you different size buds for different sized ears.The downside is I do not find the sound to be anywhere near the quality of my original iPod earbuds. I don't hear the base at all with these.The bottom line: If you prefer comfort over sound, these are great in my opinion. But again, if you enjoy sound clarity find something else."
__label__1,"Nothing Great!: I have been a fan of Mariah's since she first came out. I am still amazed with this woman's amazing knack for talent, but I think she went much too far with this cd. She portrays a trampy image of herself, and it isn't a good example for her younger fans."
__label__1,This is a woman who: Feels like all successful men owe her money for being pretty and sex. All this book is about is who she had sex with. As far as learning these peoples character she only gives one or two sentences about what they said. Its not enough that you feel like you actually get the character of these people. It scares me that she mention magic johnson in her book. I wouldn't be suprised if this woman has checked into many clinics to be treated for stds! but she wouldn't tell the public if she had. Keep that in mind. In the book its as if she wants the people reading the book to envy her!!!

__label__1,"A total disappointment: The characters in this book were more like super characters (they could & would do anything). The Mother was suppose to be moral but in the end did something so out of character it was unbelievable. The main character's decisions were poor considering the author wanted you to believe she was young and smart. Also, the editing of the book was horrible. Missed spelled words and poor sentence structure. Save your money."
__label__2,"A step into Fairyland: I first had to read Phantastes for a college English class, but i've since reread it dozens of times for my own enjoyment. MacDonald virtually transports the reader into the mind and heart of Anados (the main character) as he journeys through Fairyland. Here, Fairyland is a deeply dreamlike, sometimes nightmarish place where everything and everyone has a signifigance far beyond the surface. For me, the best part of this story is the fact that one can read it as a simple adventure or as a spiritual journey. The allegorical aspects of Phantastes are everpresent, though not blatant. MacDonald's flowery, Victorian prose allows the reader to draw only as much from Phantastes as he would like to get. However, if you read this, it will probably suck you right into the heart of the story. If you are looking for a dark, rich fantasy, this is the original..."

__label__2,"A great expansion the article in Yankee by the same author: This book is an expanded telling of the story Mr. Howe wrote for Yankee. I climbed Mt. Washington shortly after the original story. I went better prepared for the weather, thanks to Mr. Howe, and was able to assist a member of our climbing party to the ""lake of the clouds"" AMC hut (with the help of the hut staff and a cell phone). The fog seemed more like a dark blanket that shrunk the world to a few yards. A mile seemed like hundreds stopping every few feet while a fellow with a heart problem stopped to rest. After reading the original article I never considered leaving the man behind. I only wondered if he would be added to the list of those who died. I awaited this book for a few years. I met Mr. Howe at the Capitol City Dinner in Concord, NH after reading the Yankee article. Thank you sir for a great read. Thank you also for the stories that convinced me to better prepare for Mt. Washington. You may have saved a life perhaps two."

The first attempt took me nearly 5 minutes, but now it only takes 3-5 seconds.I am using it in a moderately dark room and the picture looks great. If i were to compare it back-to-back with a more expensive screen I might notice a difference, but it looks much better than a white wall. I bought the screen because it was cheap and it has met all my requirements so far."

__label__1,"one word... ugh!: I couldn't even finish this movie! It is so melodramatic and so blantantly, emotionally manipulative. Right off the bat I knew most of the facts were wrong; and I'm not even a teacher! And upon further research I found even more factual discrepancies; even some of the reactions of the parents were staged! This movie was just propaganda for corporate interest that want to profit by destroying unions. I am not in a union and I STILL found this movie to be full of baloney. B-A-L-O-N-E-Y! Yes, there are bad teachers out there but there are also bad doctors and bad bus drivers and *gasp!* bad corporations. We all (teachers, parents, students, politicians & lunch ladies) have to take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY here (an offensive concept for most, I know!) and start working together in order to fix the problems our education system faces. Oh, and btw, Finland has one of the strongest teachers union in the world. Boom! I am so right you haters can't even touch this!"
__label__2,"BEST GAME FOR PC: This has got to be the best game for pc. It is extremely entertaining and has great graphics. There are so many different units and buildings you won't be able to remember them all. The only problem with the game is that it takes too long to load, but the loading is worth it. Best of all, you dont have to mine for resources or money, unlike on starcraft and other RTS games a helicopter flys in and brings you money to build units and buildings. This game will surely keep you entertained for...years! It is worth every penny and I highly reccomend this game and the sequel too."

I appreciated this actor's wide range of acting from gangters to song & dance man. Truly an enjoyable journey into this very fascinating humble man's life. This book is written as though James was speaking right to you--having a conversation with you. Most enjoyable!"

For any fan of progressives like Queensryche, Fates Warning, or european power metal such as Helloween, Gamma Ray.....you just cant go wrong with Kamelot. Easily one of the better bands I've run across in the last several years. When they found Khan, it put them in the elite."

__label__2,"Very Easy to Keep Clean: We have four cats and have had two litter boxes for a long time. I wouldn't clean the old ones as often as I should, and the cats would often get mad and do their business somewhere else.That has all changed with this litter box. It's so easy to clean I do it every morning. We got one of these to test and all four cats started using it. So not only is it easier to clean, we only have one litter box for all four cats now.The box was easy to put together and is simple to use. Just roll it on it's side, tap the bottom (to get the stuck stuff off), roll it on it's top, reverse, slide the bin out, and pitch the stuff.Another reviewer recommends washing it monthly, and that's what we're doing. Some of the clumped material does stick to the bottom, but not much."

I decided to get some bubbles for the kids to play with and bought this bottle at just over $[...]. Last night I went to a discount store (won't say any specific names but it's a national chain with super low prices :) ) And I realized I should have shopped around before adding the bubbles to my cart. For 100 oz of bubbles I only paid $[...]!! That is right, $[...] for more than what you get here. So it's a great product but seriously overpriced. Don't make the same mistake I did, shop around and check your local discount store before buying here."
__label__1,"Good Performance, Bad Sound: I have to tell I really liked this show, but Neil Geraldo's guitar sounds like it's on the Moon...you cant hear it. Since I am big fan of Neil and a player myself, I found this VERY dissapointing. It really takes away from an otherwise great show. Unfortunatley, this one wont see much playing time. I advise you to steer clear."
__label__2,"Great product.: I have been using this product for years and I have great results. The previous product I used required heating on a stove. This is much safer and easier. The product can become hot & it is sticky so care must taken to not burn skin or spill on porous surfaces. I have the best results when there is a visible amount of hair growth. It removes the fine hairs that often cannot be seen well to tweeze. The skin must be pulled slightly taught when pelling the cooled wax. Best results are obtained when pulling against the direction of hair growth. As with most hair removal products, some redness may appear after use. I find that if used after a steamy shower, there is less discomfort and less redness."
__label__2,"Run it through the filter, please: I find myself skipping most of this album. I didnt like male or female all that much and this sounds too much like that. The single for this album had me ready to pounce on the poor dude working at the record store the day this came out, but it let me down, I thought I would be getting more of those oozy dark electro masterpeices like tripple x girlfriend. Alas, most of the album is drowned in a tangled (yet still danceable) spiderweb of electronic bleaps, beeps, squeals, and moans. I gave this album 4 stars because the tracks that I DO listen to are AMAZING. Front 242 are again pushing the bounderies of EBM, I just think they should focus more on their vocal tracks, which seem to have more solid beats and a more logical flow.I would buy this album again if I lost it, and I can say this honestly because I already have, but if I were to burn myself another copy it would be minus at least 10 of the 20 or so songs."

It's hard to believe he's the same cat. I'm very happy with this food and so is he. He loves the taste and never gets tired of it. Yes, it's a little more costly than buying the generic brand of cat food at the grocery store but I save on vet bills because my cat is never sick. I have tried other brands of food, but he prefers the taste of this one and I'm happy he's doing so well on it."

The previous model made by Cuisinart was better, although it was not cordless, it lasted many years (actually the older model still works, it's just a little corroded inside). So I figured this newer model would be even better. Considering how expensive it was, it should have lasted longer. I'm very disappointed as I thought Cuisinart usually made solid products."

His first book contained elements of To Kill A Mockingbird and Moby Dick, an understandable point when you think of his experience as a high school English teacher. This, I think, contains Hemingway and Stegner: man faces nature, love, family, society, war, responsibility and himself in the most profound ways possible. I've been lonely since Stegner left us; here's a chance to pretend that he and Papa have returned. Don't miss it."
__label__2,"An excellent addition to the Interex power supply line.: I bought this unit after needing another power strip for a new computer at my home. The sockets allocated all over its ""T"" design are spaced to allow adequate room for those large power boxes common on printer plugs and a variety of other peripherals. Also, the remote power cord saves me the effort of bending over to the floor, where the unit lies, every time I wish to switch the computer on or off. The only doubt I have is with the cord that runs between the remote unit and the power supply unit: it could have been built a little more sturdily, but the cord hasn't fallen apart with its daily wear-and-tear nonetheless.I also wanted to make the point that Interex's technical support is extremely helpful. When I inquired about the functionality of one a USB hub they manufacture, they went out of their way to spend the time with me to correct the problem (which ended up being the USB adapter by another company and not the hub itself)."

Only suggestion would be to make sure to calibrate the Nike/iPod system the first time you use it, after that the readings are very accurate.A note on customer service, the first shoe wallet I received had a defect causing it to break within the first month. When I spoke with customer service they were very friendly and apologetic. They offerred to replace the faulty product and send an extra one to make up for the trouble without even having to ask. I have not had any problems with the replacement."

The window attachment could not be set up in our wndow, if used, I had to hacksaw it to make it fit. I decided that it would not work for me. I then had to pay UPS to send it back, to the tune of 150.00! So, this is a product that cost more than 1/2 its price to return...so you better be sure its right for you.."

I have 4 controllers so that I can play multi-player games with my kids, friends and other family members. The Charging Station allows me to stack two of them in vertical style in no more space than a regular controller, but I can also connect another UBS cable so I can charge another controller as well.

__label__2,Better than guillotine: More accurate than the guillotine style so my small dog isn't afraid to have his nails clipped any more. Works great for even my tiny Pomeranian puppy.
__label__1,"Chi flat irons don't last: Beware of purchasing Chi flat irons. My daughter and I both purchased Chi flat irons (she is a hair stylist), and both of them stopped working less than 11 months later. From what I'm reading, Farouk doesn't honor warranties on their products purchased through ecom, so best to check it out before you buy since Chi products can be pricey."
__label__1,"Unmittigated, uncompromised garbage. Do not purchase.: A cursory examination of this book reveals that it is poorly researched and full of falsehoods and in some cases fabrications. A thourough examination of this book reveals the extent to which Larson has not done his homework. To wit: Dungeons and Dragons is NOT a game in which characters kill EACH OTHER with poisons and spells. Anthrax and Metallica are NOT Satanic bands. Practisioners of Wicca DO NOT worship Satan. The list goes on and on. This is nothing new to Larson; apparently he has a reputation amoungst fundamentalist Christians as a liar and a fake. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Instead check it out at the local library. Read it and understand what kind of junk people are willing to believe out of xenophobia and paranoia."
__label__2,"Great Watch!!!: This watch is even better than I had hoped for!! It's just the right size, nice and sporty. It probably has more features than I'll ever need. Love the color, it's light weight. I've worn it to go swimming, give the kids a bath, and to garden. As a mother of two kids 1 & 2, I need a watch that will hold up and this is doing the trick!!"
__label__2,Excellent: My 16 month old granddaughter loves this plane. It is a great compaion to the Fisher Price Bus as the lil' people are interchangeable. She thoroughly enjoys it.
__label__2,"Buy this book whether you're a New Yorker or a Visitor!: New York is a world unto itself and what a treasure from someone who really knows that world...I wanted to learn how to tango, for example, and found great listings for classes, places to go to practice (and show off) my new ""hot stuff"" dirty dancing techniques and even tango restaurants and bistros for the tango obsessed! how great is that??But most of all, especially now, since new york is finding its feet again,(Grab your coat and get your hat! Leave your worries on the doorstep!) it's a generous spirited, insightful, warm-hearted guide to what makes New York a great place to live and visit. I love this book!"
__label__2,"Excellent...: Optical quality of my very sharp 70-200 f4 IS does not decrease at all with this filter on, thats the most important thing.The quality of the polarizer is just great.Construction is excellent as well, and have had no problems putting in on or taking it off the lens even stacking it with its brother B+W UV filter."
__label__1,"way to sexist - very dissapointing a woman wrote this book: It is hard to believe a woman wrote this book. The strong heroine is interesting but the leading man is a total jerk and I cannot see why she would want him. I do not see how this could be called erotica or sci-fi. I was very dissapointed in this book as the main theme of the book was ""might is right"". Because he was stronger than her and she could not stop him from beating/raping her or stop the other men he gave her to from beating/raping her, then he felt he was right to do it. This may have been erotica if she had enjoyed it too, but she obviously do not, so it just made him look more of a jerk. Although he did disagree with the female that she was a slave because, acording to him, he only beat her when he had a reason to beat her, whereas a slave got a beating for no reason at all. Understand the difference?"
__label__1,"Rubber Seal Quits Working Over Time: I, too, bought this dispenser so that I could easily refill my three cats' bowls each day. While this dispenser is attractive, functional and air-tight, it is too small to hold a week's worth of food and I have to hold my hand next to the opening to keep the triangular-shaped food from being shot across the counter.After less than a year, I had to discard it because the rubber seal on the bottom kept falling off."
__label__2,"Gundam Wing Rules!: Gundam Wing is definately the coolest show I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is really cool and the machines are so awesome. Gundam Deathscythe kicks! All the characters are really cool and you find out more about them as you go along. Go Gundam Boys! (Quatre has cool hair.)"
__label__1,"Not Good: I purchased this item and did not use it right away. When I decided to try it, I found that the discs were to small, they slip right out. It's like the disc are made smaller because there's almost a 1/8"" gap. I'll need to make something to stop the disc from dropping out. It's like dropping quarters into a slot machine. ""Take Pride It's a Daisy""....BOOOOOO!!!!"
__label__1,"Not worh the money or the trouble: I was given this set as a gift and was told that Chicago Cutlery was a very good brand name for everyday knives. I was disappointed with the quality of these knives however. I found that the stamped style of the knives require you to practically saw through anything but the softest foods, a much more tedious experience than using forged knives. The handles of all the knives were poorly finished, making using the knives for an extended amount of time uncomfortable. The block also suffers from the same poor finishing as the handles. The outside was sanded fairly well, but the slots for the knives were cut poorly and were splinterED when I opened the box. Worst of all, the blades of two of the steak knives, which are riveted to the handle in three places, broke in between the first and second rivets, making the blade loose and the knives worthless. Even if this set was free, I still wouldn't take it! IT'S NOT WORTH THE FRUSTRATION!"
__label__1,"Somebody spilled their Lil Jon all over my Shadow: When it's at its best, it sounds like the gorillaz on an off day. When it's at it's worst, it could be used to coax Osama out of a cave. I thought it was a mistake. I put the CD in and then pulled it out around track 4 to make sure it wasn't a mix up at the factory and I got the new crunk in the trunk mixtape. I look forward to the make-up album that should come out soon in an effort to save face."

__label__2,"Excellent and motivational: It's very interesting seeing the comments of other people regarding this book. While saving is difficult, it seemed as if the authors found that millionaires were used to saving approximately 15% of their income. The number of people who equate this saving as ""not living life"" is pretty amazing. I did not find repetition in the author's advice, they twirled the subject around to be viewed from many different angles. I learned a lot and was often surprised and excited by their findings. This book ranks in the top 5 books I reference over and over again. For me, it is a classic on the subject of accumulating wealth."
__label__2,Good story.: Well written novel with many aspect relevant to today's world environmental issues. Schatzing maintains a good pace throughout the novel keeping you on the edge of your seat.
__label__2,"Not quite what I expected: Johnny Cash wrote two autobiographies. Cash takes up where his first left off. This is not an autobiography in the sense it takes the reader from point A to point B to point C in a chronolgical order. It's bits and pieces from here and there and in no real order. Little anecdotes, about the time Faron Young, during a car accident, got his tongue wrapped around a steering wheel and the strange thing is, two weeks before Johnny had said to him, ""If you don't stop swearing, the Lord will jerk that tongue out of your mouth."" Touching anecdote about impulsively entering a church service and sitting next to an excited boy who announced to everyone he was so certain Johnny Cash was going to sit in the same pew as him and his family. At some parts, I laughed until tears came to my eyes. I could almost hear Johnny speaking the words of the book and he has quite a sense of humor."
__label__1,"Light, cheap and way too thin: I purchased this after reading many positive reviews. When I received it I was greatly disappointed. These feel nothing like Henckel knives. They are light, off-balance and the blade is so super thin they feel like they will snap at the first sign of pressure. I cut about 5 items with these knives to test them out and then promptly returned then. These seem to be a cheap alternative to the more expensive, but better quality higher-end knives Henckels makes."
__label__1,"Disappointing and Weak. A waste of time.: I never imagined that I would read the best book I've ever read in my life and the worst book I've ever read in my life by the same author. Lonesome Dove was a capitaving, brilliant story, perhaps one of the best novels ever written. Streets of Laredo is terrible. It is one disappointment after another. McMurtry makes his first mistake when he kills any redeeming characters that survived through Lonesome Dove, leaving Captain Call and Lorena to guide the story. These two characters who are identifed by their quiet and shy personalities are not fit to guide a novel. They barely even speak! I'm sorry I wasted my time reading about two mutes and the dim-witted Pea Eye chase after a gang of weak characters. Bottom line, just stick with Lonesome Dove. I have tried to forget that I ever picked up this sequel."
__label__1,too small!: i hate these things. there is not enough nail to hold without smashing your finger or becoming irate. they suck.
__label__2,Works great: put it on 94 trx300fw took a little grinding to get it into place on the left side but other then that the install was real easy. the directions could use some work though they didnt really help much. my honda is on 26 inch tires so i didnt really need it i just like to sit high and be able to articulate with out rubbing the mud flap support
__label__1,"Another defective disc...: As said in previous reviews, a lot of the discs are defective, including mine. When used with a normal DVD player, it won't let you watch the show... it just keeps taking you to the trailers section. However, when I viewed the disc on my Playstation 2, it worked fine for the most part. The only problem is that it repeatedly asked me to confirm the parental controls whenever a new menu or scene loaded. This is a great show, but I would suggest waiting until Bandai fixes the problem before buying this. Until then, .hack//Legend of Twilight can be viewed on Cartoon Network Friday nights starting at 1:00 AM (yes, unfortunatley, its at an obscure time slot)."
__label__1,"Horrendous Gameplay, TONS of Grammatical Errors and Typos: I am appalled by this game. First of all, the ""news source"" used by the game company to compile the headlines is questionable at best, making the gameplay rather random and pointless. Second, nearly every single card is marred by a typo or grammatical error, which I just could not endure. I have written a letter to Lolo about this game, and I also plan to call them. I strongly suggest you SKIP THIS GAME and pick anything else - any game on ecom would surely be better than this one."
__label__2,AWESOME: It's such a relatable book! Extremely interesting. I think it definitely is worth the money. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
__label__2,"Miles rising: This is more than just a history of the conception and recording of ""Kind of Blue."" It's also a primer on the rise of Miles Davis as one of the premiere talents in American music. Much of the book is comprised of Miles' journey leading up to ""Kind of Blue,"" including his work with Charlie Parker, his battle with heroin addiction, and his later collaborations with Gil Evans. A must-read for any Miles fan, as well as listeners who are just discovering jazz. Informative and exceedingly well-written. I couldn't put it down, and ended up reading the whole thing in two nights."
__label__1,"Not powerful enough and barely made it 18 months.: I bought this vacuum in November 2010. the reviews seemed decent. But It wasn't powerful enough to clean even the most basic of messes in my car: the very reason I purchased it. The suction is just very weak.It does an ok job on the couch - as long as there really isn't any mess clean. Needless to say, I hardly ever used it. Today, I tried turning it on, and nothing. That's it. It had ran its course. I don't even know how long its been dead. Huge disappointment. I am not much of a complainer, which is why i never bothered reviewing it during all this time. But If i could rate a 0 I would."
__label__1,"They fit, but they stink: They claim to be rubber, but the acrid smell hasn't gone away even after airing them out for over 2 months. I'm not sure why no one else has noticed it, but I haven't been able to put food in the one jar I've been using as a ""test subject"" to see if the odor goes away. I'm afraid it will permeate any food stored in the container.If someone wants to try it, they fit clamp-down style Fidenza jars which I bought in the mid to late 1990's with wide mouths. The opening is on the jar itself is 3 1/2"".I'm buying something else with fingers crossed."
__label__2,"Fantastic! Life-affirming!: I loved this book. Yes, it is on the hippy side of things; yes, the photos look kind of funny; and yes, the language can sound kind of silly. However, I've never read such a beautiful and spiritual description of childbirth. The mindset descriped in this book is wonderful, and it also contains lots of very valuable information as well. I just adore it! I'll be reading it again and again. Wonderful book!"
__label__1,"What a mess...: I finally threw it in the trash. When it's placed close enough to the edge of the refrigerator shelf to pour correctly, if you don't push it back farther the door shelves open the faucet and the refrigerator and freezer below it fill with water. This is the 4th time and I'm done with it. Maybe it's just a bad design for my particular refrigerator but what a mess!"

If you're the type of reader who really likes to become a part of the story and really get into a book-- then you're gonna want to read this. Whatever you're age, you will like it. It's so funny and the story is truly unique. I believe Ms. Bellamy is an amazing author and I am looking forward to reading the sequel to Departures as well as her future novels. You will want to too-- pick up this book because you won't forget it."
__label__2,"Another winner from Diane Chamberlain: I only recently started reading books by Diane Chamberlain and this was my 3rd. So far, she has not disappointed! This story is told in alternating voices and times, so it's amazing to see them both come to together at the end."
__label__2,"Dickens would be proud!: Although my husband is the one who normally watched Xena during the 6 years while it was being produced, I did watch some of them.Of all the ones I saw, ""A Solstice Carol"" is my favorite. I laughed myself silly the first time I saw it and I laugh just as hard every time since. It is such a combination of holiday cliches that you just cannot help it. Even the ""little"" tribute to Hercules brings a laugh (if you recognize him).You have to watch it more than once. You're laughing so hard you're bound to miss some of the jokes the first time through."
__label__1,"Not brand new as described: I love time trax, and I love collecting movies, the only problem that I have is when I pay a premium price for an item that is supposed to be brand new, but it turns out to be a dv case full of used and scratched/scuffed discs that have obviously seen their way around the break room or wherever some employee decided to watch it. I only come to that conclusion because the item is not from a private seller. It is suppose to be factory direct via ecom. Very disappointing. I begrudgingly will not send it back as I have been waiting a long time for these to be available and I am sure with all o the problems this item has had it probably won't be around very much longer, if you don't care about condition than go for it."
__label__1,"Luna, minus the magic: Luna is a great band in the studio. All of their studio albums are beautiful and I recommend them all. When it comes to playing live, hower, they just can't create the same magic that they do in the studio. Live, Dean Wareham always sounds to me like he is bored of the songs, and he doesn't isn't trying. And all of the guitars, which sound lustrious and smooth on the records, sound hollow and labored. Take, for example, ""Sideshow by the Seashore,"" a song that opens with one of the best guitar riffs ever. On the studio version, it is a mesmerizing riff ... live, it just sounds forced and thin. I've seen them live once, and I must say I was a little bored. I've seen Galaxie 500 live as well (opening for the Cocteau Twins) ... I think Galaxie 500 played a better show."
__label__2,"Plato's Cave redux: Atlas Shrugged describes a socialism beyond extreme that could only be countered by a capitalism also beyond extreme. It's really as simple as that, in my humble opinion. Enjoy the book in that light--eschew the shadows.And this is a great time for everyone to read this work because we have an extreme in our present circumstances in America, a situation that would be abhorred vehemently by Any Rand, and should be so abhorred by all of us: An extreme form of capitalism that is aided and abetted by government; new robber barons who cannot get their gain by creativity, so must be virtually handed it by rules, codes, regulations, laws, and court reviews established and promoted by government at all levels. What at one time was our government is now in the business of advancing mediocrity.Too bad Ayn Rand or someone of her intellect hasn't yet created a neo-Atlas-Shrugged with reverse characterizations."
__label__1,"All wrong: This book is the antithesis of what I consider normal, healthy eating habits. What the author doesn't realize is that dieting only perpetuates overeating. Most people can only live with such restrictions for awhile before they go crazy and EAT EAT EAT. The only solution is to return to natural eating ... and believe me, you WILL lose weight. I weigh 105 lbs and I got here by eating whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. There is a fabulous book called ""The 7 Secrets of Slim People"" and it explains how to give up dieting forever. It's the best thing I've ever done!"

__label__2,"Great Penn Central reference! Too bad it's out of print...: Robert Reid's Penn Central System Bi-Annual is a great reference for those interested in the Penn Central railroad. Of special interest is the complete motive power review with a list of all locomotives in service at the time of publication (in 1973) and where they were serviced at. The photography in this book is excellent, with a good combination of action and roster shots. I only wish that there had been more photos in color. Overall an excellent railroad reference book!"
__label__1,"Can U Say BORING????: Most of Disney's new movies are very, very boring. And this one is no exception. I'm not saying that the original B&W version was good, but this one is bad, too.

__label__2,"Mighty Fine Stuff: I tried this product not really thinking it would work, but hoping. After trying all sorts of pain medication from the vet that made my pet very sick and never really helped his arthritis, I tried this and now he is flying around. I'm not saying that his arthritis is gone, I know it isn't, but he can go up and down stairs and runs with my other dogs. I'm not really sure how glucosamine works, but Quinny, my 11 year old dog, is much, much happier with his life now."
__label__1,It had bugs in it: There were little bugs like old flour gets so I lost confidence and had to throw it away. I did open it upon receipt.
__label__2,"A great digital camera for the money: I received this camera for Christmas and have already taken close to 300 photos on the supplied batteries. By the way, ecom had the lowest price of all the on-line places I looked and they even shipped it free! Thus far, I'm very impressed with the color accuracy in this camera. The feature I needed most was fast shutter speed (fidgety grandkids) and it delivers nicely. However, the feature that surprised me most was the anti-shake which is excellent when in the telephoto mode. I was able to take photos of cars in front of us while traveling as a passenger at 75 mph on the interstate in full telephoto mode and could read license plates very clearly in the photos! I highly recommend buying the lens adapter ring which is very inexpensive and which allows you to add filters, telephoto and wide angle lenses to this camera to make it even more versatile. I find the controls to be intuitive and user friendly and in the auto mode, my wife can take great pictures."
__label__1,"Volume 1 dissappointing: While the new series of the Power Rangers is interesting and my 5 yo loves it, he was very disappointed with the DVD. He has been waiting for it to come out and when we finally received it, it had nothing but some episodes from the new TV series. He has seen these three episodes (first three) already. The two bonus features of the older Ninja Storm series were nice, but overall it was not what he had hoped for."
__label__1,"Kind of interesting for history buffs: I can see history buffs being interested in this book. There is a lot of action , but it gets old. The story becomes too predictable and the reader get discouraged due to the stupidity of the main character who is supposed to be a super intelligent lawyer. I rather read Salgari, better arguments. I did finished the book and saw it as enterntainment only, definetely not in the line of the Davinci Code."

__label__1,"Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard: I found this book to be a waste of time and money. The main focus of the book seemed to be how inadequate the Snubby is for self-defense and I like Snubby revolvers. The author missed or minimized most of the good reasons to carry a revolver other than that they can be lite in weight."
__label__1,"Sorry I read the reviews.: After reading the reviews, I decided to give this book a try. Kassy our eighteen year old heroine is so helpless, faints, alas our 31 year old hero thinks she is so beautiful, is so mentally strong, so fragile .... .DUH. The love scenes start after a fourth of the book and seem to be on every page, along with our whining heroine. Almost felt like I was reading and old Barbra Cartland from when I was a teenager.

First off the 3:10 to Yuma is late... why name the movie 3:10 to Yuma it should had been the 3:22 to Yuma. Second I thought this was going to be a movie about trains... it was not, in fact there was barely anything about trains in this whole movie. While my 5 year old loves trains he said this movie scared him and he is now frighten of trains, and to be honest, I dont blame him."
__label__1,"Terrible quality, not true to size, or color: DO NOT buy this item!The yellow is not true to the image, it arrived as a dark yellow almost mustard color rather than the bright sunshine yellow in the photo. Also, I ordered XL based on sizes listed, and the belt was probably 3 holes too big. Luckily only needed this for a halloween costume, however it wasn't great because it was the only thing that was the wrong yellow! Also, the photo shows it yellow on both sides, mine is only yellow on one side, and you can tell the paint is very cheap and started cracking after just one night of wearing it!"
__label__1,"Awefully short. Bored in 15 mins.: After playing Link's crossbow training exhaustively for weeks, you'd expect Ghost Squad to provide at least some depth. You'd be so wrong. You basically have 3 arcade style/Time Crisis type missions each about 5 mins. long. Once you are done with the 3 missions, all you get are new costumes, new weapons and level up on the exact same missions. You still have the same places, same camera movements with slight change in number of enemies popping out.We rented it after reading reviews saying its ""too short"". We thought 5-day rental would not give us much time, but I still have 2 more days left on teh rental and I dont want to play it.My recommendation: Rent it if you have to play it and DONT buy it."

__label__2,"Good entry level bike: I purchased this bike from a warehouse store for a bit cheaper than listed here. It was delivered quickly in spite of 3 week quote. I am a moderately fit person and I wanted an alternative to my Rebok eliptical to fight boredome without a huge investment. This is a nice, quiet bike that feels pretty sturdy. As you pedal, the seat and handlebars move forward and backward. It moves through these intervals of simulated uphill vs. downhill effort rather quickly, about 5 seconds of more resistance leaning backward and then a few seconds with no resistance quite literally looking at the floor. It does keep my heart rate up. I don't feel much difference in the resistance dial from the lowest to highest, but it's a good cardio workout. I like to read while I ride, but the forward motion takes concentration and balance to not fall over the front, so books and magazines are out. For the price, I am very pleased with this machine."
__label__1,"Reasonably good text, very poor student/instructor guides.: The text itself is brief, but still a good overview of discrete mathematics. The main problem is the student and instructor guides. The answers frequently have errors and problems are not reiterated in the text, so a student or a grader has to flip back and forth between at least two books to make sense of the solutions. Even more frustrating for students is the fact that some problems do not have good answers: the author admits that he cannot solve the problem and refers to answers from other problems instead. This is simply not fair to students who may be struggling with the material.As a teaching assistant, it is not up to me to select the text books. If it were, I would look for a replacement."

__label__2,"Simple, Light, Great: Really slick. Bought for my wife.Nice tight fit for Macbook or similar.Not much room for extras like mouse or power cord, but they can be squeezed in there if necessary.Has held up really well over the 2+ years we've had it."
__label__1,Tony Bennett: I thought that Tony Bennett's new CD was dismal and not up to his usual standards. I do not plan to listen to it again.
__label__2,"Dingo Goof Balls... My dog loves them!: These little, meat filled, dog chews are loved by my dogs. They like to eat the meat strip that's weaved into the rawhide ball, then use the ball for a play toy. My mom's dog however,eats the whole thing. We have been purchasing these for several years now. Good product."
__label__2,"Still using a mouse for digital art?: If you are a serious artist that wants to create digital artwork , you have to have this product. Back in the early days, I did all digital artwork with a mouse. I was weary about using a ""fake pencil"" - was I wrong. As a traditional artist of 20+ years, it did take me a while to get use to the stylus - it's not exactly like using a pen/pencil. But if you work with it each day, you become familiar with it quickly. However, there is a downside - it makes you draw more, be careful - LOL!"
__label__1,"Disappointedly not Follets caliber we expect of him: Skip this book and re-read Pillars of the Earth. This books is not up to Mr. Follets standards and capabilities. Predictable, boring and easy to figure out. His other books are excellent."
__label__2,many uses: I use this to connect to speakers or my tv. It has good quality sound and has good connectors that don't come loose. I have mainly used this with my tv so I can play video games and not have to listen to people trash talk me all the time.
__label__2,"pretty cool.: The Roomba works. I have two cats and it picks up the cat hair that gets everywhere everyday. I used to use a handheld vacuum everyday but now I press clean and I can run errands or knit or learn how to play the piano. It can get annoying to pick up cords everyday, so I figured out a way to remove them. I clean the filter everyday, and I was really surprised to see how much cat hair it picked up. I still vacuum my couch to remove pet hair weekly but people have mentioned that my floors look cleaner than they ever have before. Clean regularly andit works."
__label__1,"Dont Bother.............Wait for it to play on local cable: i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT."
__label__2,"Nice Trolley: Nice Trolley. Would have given 5 stars except I am very disappointed in the color. I would not call it Burgundy. I don't even see any Burgundy in it. The design is largely orange and red on a black background and not a pretty fabric, but it appears sturdy and will serve the purpose."
__label__1,"Great Movie! Crappy DVD!: I love this movie.But I hate Paramount for treating such a classic this way. This editon of THE GODFATHER is one of the poorest transfers to DVD that I've ever seen. Light and color levels fluctuate like a bad 60s acid flashback. Trash and dirt specks fly through several scenes like swarms of insects.There's a Coppola commentary, but no other extras. And I can live without too many extra features, as long as the movie itself has been remastered with respect not only for its artistic merit, but also for its intended audience.Do NOT buy this DVD, unless you're willing to view the movie as it would be seen through a tank of murky water. This is an insult to every fan of this movie, and Paramount should be very, very ashamed."
__label__1,"Disappointed: I was excitied when I first discovered that this wonderful version of the Bible was available as an ebook - have been looking for this one. However when I downloaded it, I discovered that one could only navigate by books, and not chapters. Fine for reading through, but not for working with. Hope this will be offered again with improved navigation."
__label__2,"Excellent on About 700 Levels from 450 Different Angles: The short version:Mississippi African-American Catholic (and all the suffering that would entail) turns liberal revolutionary (and all the disillusionment that would entail) turns Orthodox seeker (That means satisfied fulfilled servant of the Lord). got this as a present 12-25-02, sat down and read it in it's entirety on 12-28-02. Recommend it highly for us 'children of the 60s' and spiritual seekers, touches the reader on so many different levels it is amazing. A short, quick, engaging read that packs a mighty wallop. For a WASP from the South coming to terms with many of the issues Raboteau went through, this was a marvelous book. Thanks! Raboteau's other works are superb as well."

__label__1,BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE: This company scams people....dont give them your credit card number because they will send you material you never requested and keep billing you $ 79/ month + shipping fees indefinitely....hard to reach customer service....THEY HAVE TO BE THE WORST COMPANY DOING BUSINESS ONLINE...NO EXAGGERATION.
__label__1,I'm sorry but nope!: I am a teen and I loved the original Lion King. Maybe just growing up and remembering the original movie made me biased about this film but I hated it. I thought it focused ay to much on Timon and Pumba's history and not enough on the original story.
__label__1,"Outdated: Although I knew the copyright on the book was 2003, I bought the book and went shopping in NC in June 2007. A lot of the retailers are gone. I was looking forward to shopping at Rose and Utility Craft and both were closed for business. Blacks has moved. Furnitureland South has 1 million sq. feet of furniture and a good place to look, but prices were better at Blacks. Also be careful because a lot of the furniture is not from NC, but from Asia. This book was probably helpful years ago, but now is very outdated."
__label__2,"Gives Peace of Mind: This is very handy to have. So far my newborn son has only had to use the electrolytes, but it is reassuring to know that everything is pre-approved. I was also pleased to see that the expiration dates on the packages are a few years out."
__label__1,"Terrible, don't buy unless required: I had to buy this because my instructor wrote this book and homework assignments were from the book.The whole book is designed very poorly and I remember having to flip back and forth just to read it straight forward. Let me clarify. As an example, I would be reading a paragraph that refers to page C, so I would go to page C and that page C refers to page A, etc. It was just painful to try to understand what this.Today (after 5 years later), I use this book as an example of how not to write a book."

__label__1,"MMOs are the devil: I have absolutely not desire to play this game, now or ever. I purchased it for my Final Fantasy collection only."
__label__1,"Could have been better art.: I always remember playing the fish game at all ages. This wasn't what I thought it would be. I was expecting larger, a heavier card stock and better art images for the fish."
__label__1,"Just Friends is an awful movie: I didn't even finish watching this movie - everything about it was awful - the acting, the storyline. I'm not one to write online reviews but this was so bad I think it deserves fair warning."
__label__2,flatware storage: I was looking for a minimal space storage for silverware we inherited from my mother in-law. I wanted to be able to access it easily as well as have it not tarnish. I am very pleased with how this product works. I can put it in a closet out of the way yet get to it easily. This was a great transaction!
__label__1,"hello!!! what happened here???: Ok lets get right to the point veary chingon movie, lots of action good gangster s*** but this!!! I mean wheres the firme musica??? You would think with such a great movie the soundtrack to the movie would be so bueno but it just doesent grab my attention at all. I mean some of the songs are good like the one bye Funkadoobiest and Girls It Aint Easy bye the 4 Corners and the one bye Boss Catch Hit and Run but on these songs they are a different version of the songs not the ones like the way they were in the movie and they left some good songs out for instence, the one So Ruff so Tuff by Zapp and Roger great song!!! but not on there. Well I have them already it's just the point that they left some stuff out. Well... just understand me, in what i'm saying and get somthing else like the Bound By Honor soundtrack. Now thats a good one!!! as for the 1 in rating well you figure it out."
__label__2,"I'd recommend it: This product is really cool, but the VHS feature is a bit out of date, and I could not get the TV function to work. However, I was able to control the TV and cable box with the learn function. Overall, I'd recommend it. It would have been cooler in the 90's."
__label__2,"GREAT SHOW - GREAT SEASON - even Brooke Shields: I love this show, I lived the seventies! What a cool time to grow up! In this set, I especially enjoyed seeing Brooke Shields play Mom to Jackie and girlfriend to Bob. The scene where Jackie and Donna discover Pam (B Shields) in a hot tub with Bob is too funny. Jackie and Donna joining forces to try to split their parents up is a hilarious change. Aaah - the Seventies!I noticed a review from a customer with skips, freezes, etc. If you have a problem with freezing, skipping, etc with a disc from a boxed set, try playing it in a friend's DVD player to be sure it isn't your player. Back in 2003 I returned two different boxed sets of ""Keeping up Appearances"" thinking both were defective. Skips and freezes showed up in same place on same disc with both BOXED sets. With the third set, I decided to try in a friend's DVD player. It played perfectly. The problem had been my player all along. My defective player was a RCA DRC220N - discarded since 2003."
__label__1,"I believe this heater could have killed me.: I used the Coleman Catalytic heater (1,500 btu version) over the weekend, as did a friend of mine. We camp in the front end of a gooseneck horse trailer; we each had our own trailers. These heaters were new out of the box. Did not heat the small space at all(only 30 degrees outside), ditto on everyone else's comment about the smell. Then in the morning the inside of our trailers (ceiling and walls) were COVERED with BLACK SOOT; as were our faces and everything we coughed up for the next 8 hrs. The space was ventilated!!It was very scary to think about what we had inhaled all night long.The next comment will be directly to Mr. Coleman. If it was just my heater that did this, I would assume it was faulty. However, my friend had exactly the same experience with it. I would not recommend this product!!"
__label__2,Maureen: Loved the show! Highly underrated! LIstening to the CD brought it all back to me! The music is terrific even if you haven't seen the show.
__label__2,"A DVD concert video done right...: This is as the Eagles, Steely Dan and others have done. Choose a soundstage, a small live audience and rock.... The video was clear, with multiple camera angles. The audio was superb as well. I watched it in 5.1 and 2.0, and I prefer the AC-3 version of 5.1. Once again, the production was well thought out, these people can still put on a show..."
__label__1,Tool holder: I still use it because I haven't found anything better. It doesn't stay attached to my grill very well. I have a smaller Weber grill. Since this is not bent to the shape of the grill it tends to fall off - along with the tools I have hanging on it.
__label__2,"Will continue to buy from ecom: Same thing as we get at our vet, but a lot cheaper. Other sites are comparable, but I already know the service is good with ecom, so we keep getting it here."
__label__2,Benny DeVeto: I learned quite a bit about the Mexican war I did not already know. It is not as good a book as either Across the Wide Missouri or The Course of Empire. I would recommend reading these two books first.
__label__2,"Great Product!: This is one of the best learning toys made for kids. All of my kids from my 2yo to my 9yo love it! There are so many different 'games' that they never get bored and are actually learning something. They, of course, think they are playing a video game, only we parents need to know the truth! ;-)"
__label__1,Disappointed: I didn't really enjoy the book. It was alright but not a keeper for me. The story was interesting at times but got bogged down with details at times but the image of the hardships was vivid.
__label__1,"Don't buy this book: I was totally disappointed with Fondue It! I expected a jumping off point closer to traditional fondue, but instead, the majority of the book deals with elaborate recipes -- spring rolls, grilled polenta -- that are better suited to kitchen preparation, not around the fondue pot, with full guest interaction. Also, the book was laid out in an amateurish, hard to follow way. It was really not what I, as an experienced cook but a beginner at home fondue, was looking for."
__label__1,"Edited product - agenda included: This product is crapola, frankly. They cut out 3 1/2 hours of material regarding Pagan Rome, including the magnificent performances of James Mason as Tiberius and Richard Kiley as Claudius. I watched this on TV as a young woman and was fascinated by it because of the scope and the view of ancient Rome. At that time, there was no such subtitle as ""The trials and whatever of the early church,"" it was just A.D.--another potboiling miniseries. forget this thing and seek out the VHS original. Yet another example of Christian-based censorship."
__label__2,"Duane Eddy CD: Lot's of his best. It gets played very often, along with some others and many more other artists. Buy this one."
__label__2,"Wonderful account of some great episodes in a great series!: Depp Space Nine is the best television series of all time, and the episodes these books novelized were some of my favorites. I like novelizations if the episodes they're based on are good, I hate them if they're not. I was really disappointed on the T.V. show ""Behind the Lines"" That they showed the dumb Kira part instead of the Argolis mission, and I was glad that the novelization included that part. This series was so good that I read it nonstop and finished it in four days. The John Vornholt Next Generation ones were good too."
__label__2,Great for the gym: Very neat and compact.... The thing is that prepare for the plastic to tear! I have to think about getting a new one after almost a year. It was fun while it lasted!
__label__1,"Insulting: This film perpetuates the myth that a large percentage of the German population was clueless about the genocide taking place in their country. It diminishes the horrific brutality of concentration camp life. And it asks us to feel sorry for the one innocent German boy who was ""accidentally"" gassed, instead of the millions of others equally innocents who were systematically slaughtered. This film is insulting to the memories of all those persecuted under Hilter's reign."
__label__1,"Does not work well with Canon Powershot S50.: I'm about to send for my second replacement for this Viking card. After filling up the card with pictures and video, it has given me the message 'memory card error' on both the original and replacement cards. Everything on the cards was lost.I tried Viking because it appears to be the best selling card on ecom, so perhaps I've just had bad luck so far. But the Lexar Media CF256-12-251 256 MB, USB, 12X, High-Speed CompactFlash Card I bought has worked from day one with no errors."
__label__1,"Horrible DVD Quality: Great movie, horrible DVD video quality. The transcription to DVD is a disgrace."
__label__2,"Not the best but pretty good: Ok- I think Nigel Calders book is better- but I like this book to. The writer has a good style. I particularly like the troubleshooting checklists, that are orgainized from most likely cause to least likely. Also has some good decision making flow charts. I think there is a lot of practical information here presented in an easy to read style. It is one of the two diesel books I always refer to. Would I buy again? YES"
__label__1,"Badly Placed on/off button: The on/off buttons are in the position shown on the pink/purple iron above, not on the close up of the black one. It is really easy to hit them with your fingers as you manipulate the iron and turn it of. Many new conairs have this issue. Shame - this one is going back."
__label__1,"every girl round here got built in dave radar: this is not one of dmb's must buys. it lacks energy, and dave doesn't put on a very good vocal performance. many songs on this have been on three or four other albums, and many others just seem to gone on without purpose. ""two step"" is my fave dave song, and it really wanders off to nowheresville on LISTENER SUPPORTED. ""crash into me"" is very dissapointing, and so is ""#41"". all in all, a descent album, but not up to the standards of other dave greats such as LIVE AT LUTHER COLLEGE."
__label__2,convenient: My main reason I bought this was for the separate nap setting which allows me to set the alarm during the day for a nap without changing the normal alarm settings I use in the morning. The display brightness is fine for me. I don't use the radio so I'm not a good judge of its quality.
__label__1,Piece of Junk: Record Rewind Pause Live Tv On Computer Capture Tv Video ImagesCouldn't get it to work. Had to return it. What more is there to say? Title tells it.
__label__2,Storage Case: This is a very sturdy product that works well with medium to thin puzzles. Excellent for helping keep puzzles in one place.
__label__1,"HUUUUUUGE disappointment: As a fan of Blonde Redhead's work for quite some time, I bought this as soon as I had money to do so. I was so excited to hear this record. I loved their old stuff, I loved Misery...even with how different it was from the old stuff. It was just so beautifully done, I didn't care. 23, on the other hand, is just plain bad. The music definitely picks up where Misery left off, but it's really boring. The vocals are equally boring. There is no intensity at all to this. Not to mention that there is no artwork really to speak of. The red wrap around banner is pretentious to say the least. Open it up and there's....nothing. No lyrics, no liner notes, nothing to really draw people to actually purchase this, as opposed to downloading it. Then again, the music doesn't really do that, either."
__label__1,"Why???: Whoever decided to leave the Nora Jones song off of the sound track should be fired. I would have bought the CD just for that song. But since it is polluted with all that other noise, there is no way I will purchase it."
__label__1,"Worked great for 6 months: We bought three of these drives over a period of several months. Not one of them lasted more than 6 months. The failures all started the same: The computer would not recognize the drive, then it would, then it wouldn't, until one day it finally stopped recognizing it completely. Rather than return the drives, I installed them in an old computer we are using as a server. Two of the drives had to be reformatted, and only one still had all the files on it. So it appears the problem is with the drive enclosures and not the drives themselves. My recommendation? Don't put anything on one of these drives that you can't afford to lose."
__label__1,"Set kitchen on fire - Don't buy!: Piece of junk - spend a little more for a higher quality product, not worth the risk - after owning this toaster for a few months the cable sparked and started a small fire in my kitchen. Cuisinart does not cover shipping on returns and it costs almost as much to ship it back as it does to buy a new one - so beware."
__label__2,"The ULTIMATE collection: Madonna's 1990's hit compilation, is a collection of all her hits, taken from her 80's albums:""Madonna,"" Like A Virgin,"" ""True Blue,"" and ""Like A Prayer,"" singles, soudtrack singles(""Crazy for you,"" from ""Visoin Quest,"" ""Into the groove,"" from ""Desperately seekng Susan""), ending with 3 new ones. Here they are, like th e originals they'er fresh sung (first recorded in her 20's, now in her 30's), and outstanding. Unlike the originals, the instrumests are different, and the they'r slighly taloired, so they'r not as long. The time length(for all of them): 4:04, 3:36, 3:59, 3:11, 3:52, 3:45, 4:08, 5:17, 4:08, 3:50, 3:47, 5:50, 4:02, 3:53, 5:17, 4:59, 5:31. Ending with the dance classic ""Vogue,"" the sensual ""Justify My Love,"" and the inspirational ""Rescue Me."" This is outstand with great pictures, and a great article. Genious Madonna!"
__label__1,"Crap.: I couldn't even get 30 seconds into the second track, it's just horrible. The first track is just a bunch of random electronic style noises that are a complete mess and totally uncoordinated. If you can get past the first two tracks, then you are more tolerant than me. Other than that, what I have heard sucks."
__label__2,"Really Helps: My feet hurt so bad. The moment I put these on there was relief. They need to make one left and one right. That would make it easier to put on if you need two at a time like I do. But otherwise, worth it."
__label__2,"Eric Burdon/Jimmy Witherspoon: ""Guilty"": This CD is so well hidden, the folks who would want it are unlikely to find it (or realize what it is). This was originally released in '71 under the title ""Guilty,"" & credited to Eric Burdon & blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon. The backing band on one track is War. It is a true collaborative effort by 'Spoon & Eric, who share & trade the vocals. As befits 'Spoon, it is pretty straight-ahead, no nonsense blues. Eric makes sure that the groove is more '70's than '40's, & 'Spoon keeps him honest.Although the cover versions of The Laws Must Change (John Mayall), Have Mercy Judge (Chuck Berry) and the blues chestnut Goin' Down Slow are solid (James Taylor's Steam Roller Blues fared poorly), the highlights are the originals by 'Spoon & Eric. Especially noteworthy is the gospel-tinged finale, The Time Has Come, complete with Rev. James Cleveland Choir.Eric Burdon has had a notoriously uneven career, ranging from inspired to insipid. This is great stuff."
__label__2,"Reverance for Life: This is a remarkable book in so far as it brings a much greater depth to Schweitzer than one might get without it. While Schweitzer has many insightful things to write, how he writes and what he says about himself conveys quite a lot. I think the figure of Albert Schweitzer has become cliched over the decades. Reading how he saw the world is time well spent and shows how shallow cliches can be."
__label__2,Love them: I had just bought a new car top carrier and I have always removed the manufactor's logos and replaced with these.
__label__1,"Disappointed and Frustrated: I bought this toy box for my daughter and it came without instructions, which made it difficult to put together. Even so, I managed to figure it out. However, the safety hinge didn't work. The spring in the hinge literally had no give, therefore, the lid wouldn't close no matter what we did. The wood sounded as though it was going to snap. Since we didn't have instructions, my husband and I tried putting the spring on in every way possible. I had to return the toy box because there was clearly something severely wrong with the hinge. Needless to say, I was very disappointed and frustrated."
__label__2,"Nora Roberts has done it again: I have read the entire Quinn Trilogy. I loved every minute of it. While waiting for Inner Harbor to appear, I re-read the first two. The conclusion was terrific. It leaves the reader with hope that the world doesn't have to be a terrible place. I would love to see Nora Roberts write a follow-up on Seth. I find that with most book series, the characters become life-like and leave me wanting more."
__label__2,Loved this book: David Kusumoto has given such a wonderful and helpful review here. I have little to add except that I loved this book. I have read it once and listened to the audio tapes 3 times. Just saw the movie. It is a book to be savored.I wish I could have read David's review first.
__label__2,"""I'm keeping flowers in full bloom"": The above line is from the fantastic song ""The Great Beyond"", which easily surpasses any individual song from the last three R.E.M albums. In lyric content, melody, and the great harmony on the chourus, it is superb. The musical score is intersting, but often slight. If you are a trememdous fan of R.E.M. or Andy Kaufmann, then of course you will want this. Otherwise, it's probably not worth your while."
__label__1,"A great disapointment considering maker's reputation: small screen says paper jammed even when no paper shows anywhere in machine. Impossible to send any faxes or make copies. The periodic report of calls works well, and there are no jams. Rings are decently loud, but that is it!It is out of warranty, so the Panasonic people want me to pay, with credit card, before they ARE willing to answer any questions. Avoid this little machine, no matter the cost, because it is likely you will choose another make. A real disgrace for Panasonic, and I shall probably avoid any of their products except televisions."
__label__1,"not very good: I am Laotion and wanted to be up to date on my language skills, so I purchased this book a couple of years ago to expand my Lao vocabulary. I noticed that some of the words are wrong, not just spelled wrong, but are of a totally different subject! Also, the diagram for the different Lao tones at the beginning of the book are difficult and complicated to understand. It's not clear on how to pronounce each tone. For a language that is based on tones, I think it's better just to buy a book w/ a cd rom so you can hear exactly how the tones are pronounced. I was extremely disapointed w/ this book."
__label__1,Won't buy again: I have to agree with a previous post. These strips have a tendency to run. I recently took my daughter to the Doctor because of a positive UTI reading which was false. In the end you get what you pay for.... I never had issues in the past with non-generic brands.
__label__1,"ALEGRIA: BEWARE! FOR THOSE WHO ARE FANS OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL, AS I AM, ALEGRIA WILL COME AS A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. IT IS A FILM WITH A SILLY STORY SO INCONSEQUENTIAL, UNBELIEVABLE, AND NONSENSICAL THAT IT WILL APPEAL NEITHER TO ADULTS, CHILDREN, NOR THEIR PETS. THE CASTING IS ATROCIOUS: THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE UNAPPEALING (EXCEPT FOR THE FEMALE LEAD)INCLUDING A MISCAST, HOPELESSLY OVERWEIGHT FRANK LANGELLA. THE FANTASTIC CIRQUE PERFORMERS ARE SHOWN IN EXTREMELY BRIEF EPISODES, SUGGESTING THAT THEY WERE MAINLY PICKUP SHOTS WHILE PERFORMING IN BERLIN AND CUT INTO THE BODY OF THE PRODUCTION FILMED IN AMSTERDAM. THE NON CIRQUE PERFORMERS, INCLUDING THE ALLEGED CLOWNS, HAVE NEITHER WIT, CHARM,NOR TALENT,ALL HALLMARKS OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.

__label__1,"An unfortunate event..: I am sorry to say, but this was a very sad order! this company sent the order to the address specified and was tracked to the same street but for some reason the shipping company sent the package back as ""deliverable"" to the original company. So, instead of them shipping it back overnight as requested, they replied saying they would attempt to return the money. make sure you check the ratings and quality before you buy!!"
__label__2,"Second to none!: I have read this book over and over again to absorb all the information! It is so good and contain a wealth of information. Comparing it wit the books by Danja and Annmarie Kohler, Mark Webster and Jim Church's book on composition, this one comes in as a clear first. Mark Webster's book is a relatively close runner up, but it is Marin's book that always join me on my trips and elsewhere. Photography in all books is good but Martin provides the most and best information. Jim's book is a waste of money compared to the rest. Overprized with very little hard info. Just a ton of mumbojumbo. The book by Koehler is ok, but way behind Webster, and in particular. Edge's books! Get it and love it!"
__label__2,"Good Eating: I have been preparing sourdough pancakes and waffles for over 25 years using dozens of methods and techniques, but the simple recipe on pg 56 beats them all for flavor, texture, and overnite preparation! The Sour Cream Silver Dollar pancakes and the Cornmeal Blueberry Cakes are a tie for second place at our breakfast table. I would rate this little book 5 stars, but I haven't tried more than about four of the recipes-yet. As they say, enjoy!"
__label__2,"riveting: Riveting! Often things unspoken are more important than what is said. This show is too subtle for some people, but thrilling for enough of us. Thank you MAD MEN."
__label__1,"don't waste your time people.: Im sorry to say this too all the naive people who loved this book, but this is a cheap run-off of the already crappy book, ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" by Alexander Dumas. Whoever thinks they are a great or intellecual person because they liked this piece of garbage is really a small and simple person who gets pleased by an extremely boring, if not, the most boring book with a cheesy, go happy plot. But hey, at least you can say that you read a really long book and show off about that."
__label__1,doesn't fulfil the expectations..: I agree with the review made by the first reader from Washington D.C. Having waited so long this book no where matches the practicalities involved in the implementation of Oracle financials..
__label__2,"Very Nice All-inclusive Unit: Sony is a brand that demonstrates solid quality all of the time. The DAV-FX900W kept true to that. The unit as some have said does load and change disks slow but overall this would be the only flaw I've seen. Very nice sound, easy installation and fair amount of customizations. For someone who's looking for a nice unit that's easy to use and offers great sound, this is for you."
__label__1,"It didn't really work...: The harness didn't really stop my dog from pulling. I have a very energetic 45 lb mixed breed that isn't well socialized or leash trained. I was hoping this would help with the latter. It did deter her from pulling, but not without constant pressure and redirection from me. And it did very little to discourage her when she saw a squirrel or a mouse that looked worth chasing. I didn't lose control of her, but my arm was definitely sore when we got home. We went for a mile walk for the test run, and I checked her immediately for signs of irritation that many other users have reported. She had a big red spot under her leg, no broken skin or lost fur, but I will not put her through that again."
__label__2,"Still great aftert all these years: Okay, so I loved this album when I was a young teen, and it still translates. They were kids back then; saw them again in the Meadowlands 10 years ago and I saw some grandparents take two generations with them. Still the greatest rock and roll band in the world!"
__label__2,"Pinball Machine Care & maintenance: Overall, a very good book on the subject. You can do regular/needed maintenance on your own. Gives the reader the foundation knowledge needed to understand your pinball machine. Worth the money."
__label__2,"Good reading for every level, excellent guide for advanced r: Written by old, inexact, but still elegant language. Describes techniques and approaches one can never find anywhere else. Hard to follow. Extatic to reproduce by your own."
__label__2,"Great seat: My son loves his booster seat, he feels like a big boy without having to strap him in. Color is great, matches our chairs."
__label__1,"A disappointing effort: I was so excited when I heard that there was a new Nick Cave CD. As dearly as I love ""Murder Ballads"" and ""Let Love In,"" I was hungering for some new Nick.Well, this isn't what I was hungry for. Only three songs -- ""As I Sat Sadly By Her Side,"" ""Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow"" and ""We Came Along This Road"" -- resonate with the vocal and lyrical intensity of his past works. The rest of them are too wordy or too vocally weak. (Who the heck told Nick to start singing in a higher register?)If you're new to Nick, don't start here -- begin with the wonderful ""Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"" which has a good selection from all thei albums. If you're a longtime Nick fan, give this one a listen at your friendly local record store before deciding to buy. I sold mine and haven't regretted it once."

__label__1,worst brush ever: Yikes this brush is horrible! I have long thick hair and it feels like I'm destroying my hair when I use this brush. I have large paddle brushes from the Dollar Store they are much better.
__label__1,"Dave, what happened!: As a big fan of the last two Foo albums I was eagerly awaiting the release of the third. Boy, what a let-down. The first three tracks are great but after that the whole thing falls apart. All the other songs have absolutely no appeal. They sound nothing like the other records and more like recycled soft-rock trash! If your looking for proper alternative rock, then look elsewhere."
__label__2,"Takes me back: When I saw this was out there to rent I was so excited. I have been looking for this, for a long time. I used to love Mitch Gaylord. This took me back to seeing it at the movies. Acting is ok, and the soundtrac takes you back to the 80's. I do have to say being a female, this is a chick flick as people would say. But it is a good movie."
__label__1,"Nearly useless for writers: Other than a list of abnormal personality types and one or two other items that were probably cribbed from elsewhere, this book is of no help whatever to a writer that wants to understand the criminal mind. It's so heavily opinionated without supporting data and contains so much over-written prose that everything the author states is subject to skepticism. It got to the point that I just didn't believe anything he wrote. Many examples of the problems have been mentioned by other reviewers."
__label__1,"Slow Story of Human Development and a Special Friendship: While I was emotionally touched by the friendship/love held by the two main characters, Antonia and Jim, I was rather unimpressed with her style. Much of the story, especially the first half, is filled with boring details of life in Nebraska and unimportant events that occur in thier lives. Characters are often times introduced superficially and then dug up again later in the story, leaving the reader to feel that he or she is missing something about the character being referred to. Possibly someone who enjoys the simple life and longs for the simple days of the past would get more out of this book."
__label__1,MORSE STEEL CUTTING BLADE: I DO NOT KNOW IF I DID SOMETHING WRONG BUT THE BLADE CUT GREAT THE FIRST 2 TIMES I USED IT BUT AFTER THAT IT HAS TROUBLE CUTTING THROUGH CLOSET DOOR TRACKS
__label__2,"flawless: this book is worth the $. It describes the concepts perfectly, concisely for the intermediate/advanced student of Spanish to the language's nuances without causing the reader to reach for the dictionary several times over one page. It reviews: how & where consonants are pronounced, vowel sounds, accentuation, plenty of definitions (sonoridad vs sorda, espirantizacion, lenicion, etc) within the first two chapters. The following chapters address la formacion verbal, la formacion nominal y adjetival, formacion pronomial, el lexico: diferencias semanticas, tiempos verbales, y los modos verbales: indicativo y subjuntivo. Whether you're a seasoned veteran with Spanish, or still learning, this book is the best on the market regardless of it being older than a few others. The one drawback is that it does NOT use international phonetic symbols, but anyone with some light familiarity with the international symbols will be able to crack this book in no time."
__label__2,Decent introduction: My Son attended UPS and graduated the year this book was published. It is a decent review of the College from his point of view although he rates campus food lower and off campus options better. He discovered that off campus housing is difficult for males to get given landlords bias. He thought the academics were great for a Science major and would have put at the top of the best things list the financial aide Finacial aide for good students and Profs willingness to help. As a parent I was pleased that Dean's meeting with parents during Frosh orientation warning that entrance scholarships were likely to be it. His Sr. year cost after Aide was a fraction of instate cost. Good book about a fine college.
__label__1,Copy and Paste: Half of this book is just copy and paste from the Atmel Datasheet. The other half are several projects that gives little explanation of what's going on in the project. Don't waste your money buying this book. Download and print Atmel AVR Datasheet. You learn more that way. The datasheet is much more complete and clear. They are also constantly updated.
__label__1,"Not for kids: The walker is attractive in colour and appealing to parents due to the educational wooden cubes, but it is not at all practical for the toddler learning to walk. Firstly it is very heavy so although baby can push it, they cannot turn it around, so they stop once they hit a wall. Also the section that has the rubber cubes in it has two people painted on it and the paint has come off onto the cubes. It has not been recalled, but not sure if there is lead in the paint or not, so now I will not let my child play with them. Advice for the new parent is to buy a cheaper walker which is more practical for the toddler learning to walk, such as the Vtech ones. The cubes are appealing, but you can always buy them separately."
__label__2,"Ultima II is the ""Ultimate Make-Up!"": I love this Ultima II Make-Up product and see it is becoming extinct! I CSM not believe more consumers are not aware of the quality of this make-up. I hope the manufacturer wil review their decision to discontinue this product! I was very pleased with the service of the ecom provider I dealt with! Hopefully a lot more in the future."
__label__1,Excellent Camera Bag: The bag is quite roomy and very well made. The balance is excellent so that the weight is well distributed. I like it very much.
__label__1,"DC Universe gets cold!: I was hoping this would be really good considering the talent involved. Kesel, Marz, Immonen, & McKone and all talents that I enjoy today. Looking back at their work here from the mid-nineties am glad their work has evolved. Here we are given the problem of something that eats the sun called the Sun-eater. Makes sense. However, the danger always seemed a little generic and not terrifying as it really would be. The book was also short considering the premise. I was disappointed by the overall ""hokeyness"" that turned me off of DC Comics back then. Overall, there is no real reason to check this out other than getting a look at some comics veterans early work."
__label__1,"Legend of the what?: Let me tell you, this movie had to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. it was no ""bog body"" roaming around killing. It actually looked like Popeye the Sailor. My suggestion to all is to steer totally away from this Vinnie Jones flop. Pick up either The Condemned or The Midnight Meat Train instead. Way better movies. Sorry Vinnie it just plain sucked!!!!! This would have got a zero star rating if I could have done it."
__label__2,"A candid endeavour!: This was a bold, frank, empassioned endeavour from a candid, cunning artist. The lyrics ooze heartbreak and demand compassion. ""Kaw-Liga"", which borrows musicians from the Bulgarian Philharmonic (I just love it when Yastindov Konstantinplov gets down on the balalaika while Hank strums the dulcimer), is about Hank Junior's previous career as a minced pastrami salesman."
__label__1,The Pro model is useless 1/3/4 diameter: virtually useless. No where in the do they mention this is a 1 3/4 inch roller. I use a special standard 1.5 inch white foam roller which isn't available in this size. Add specs if you are going to sell a product like this.

__label__2,"Walking Dead, Season II; Bloodletting: This series is a much watch. The quality on my kindle is awesome. The series itself keeps you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait for season III next week."
__label__1,"Not in the same league as Sookie Stackhouse: I actually read this because another reviewer objected to the sex. (There are fairies that turn women into nymphomaniacs at least temporarily.) My problem with the book is that the female protagonist can't spot a clue until it bites her, not just on the ass but in a tender spot, and she is mildly incompetent. I like heroines who are at least fairly intelligent and resourceful. To me that is bottom line."
__label__1,"Where We Stand: Class Matters: Where We Stand is a book that relates class and race. As you read you are confronted with a number of instances related to you by the author about her childhood. She does this to illustrate her point when confronted by class discrimination that goes beyond race later in the book. I read this for a College level English class and was constantly analyzing, and picking apart this piece of literature. during the course of our discussion, we came to the conclusion that bell hooks was seeing past the social constraints and looking at the real ""problem"" with society, Class. This seems like a good idea, but throughout the book I was constantly agitated with the way she presents material and argues her point, halfway through the book I put it down, I didn't need this monologue of at times childish whining."
__label__1,never arrived: I ordered this product but it never was delivered even though ecom tracking info said it did. I eventually got my money back after waiting for 2 weeks.
__label__1,Disappointing: Ordered 2. One was broken on arrival. The 2nd broke on 1st use. No invoice in box to know who to contact. I will not recommend the item or company.
__label__2,"A Standout Golf Book!: Paging through this book it doesn't take long to recognize that Golf Training is no ordinary golf book. Instead of the usual stroke savers and swing tips common to the mass of generic golf books out there, Golf Training digs deeper into the fundamentals of mental training, fitness training, developing a good swing, and the keys to effective practice. This latter subject of ""how to practice most effectively"" is powerful, practical, and backed by what seems to be sound sports science. The author has done her research, and it shows in this clear, authoritative text. Though written by an LPGA pro, I found Golf Training to be a standout book that should help any golfer--male, female, high/low handicap--to play better. This is a glossy book, with many great action and instructional photos that support the text. A classy book and a great read!"

__label__2,The best Disney animation by far!: This was a spectacular film. Disney has truly outdone itself on this one. The film was animated really well. There was character development and a plot. I cried and I laughed. This is a wonderful film.

It's great and my hands or arms are not in pain after baking :-)The only thing I might tune a little would be the noise level.. it's a little on the noisy side, but that is nothing compared to its performance.Only 3 weeks I've been using it so far so good.. i'll keep you posted in a couple of years lol.ecom delivered fast and easy:)"
__label__2,A Good Resource Book: Grasping God's Word makes an excellent resource book for any personal library. It is written in such a way that readers on several levels of education may find it informative and useful. A strong emphasis on application of Scripture is much appreciated.

__label__1,"Keef is a guitar slinger, maybe a vocalist but the way this is mixed you never know.: While there are so many anthem guitar riffs from Keith we all need to tip our hats to, his journeys into rock records where he is the vocalist, no hat tipping needed.I am sure he means well and there are stellar sounding tracks, I'd bet there isn't a linguist or interpriter amongst us that can decipher what Keith is wailing, crying and growling about. Then to make matters worse, for some reason his vocal lines are mixed well below the level of the surrounding music, yes this hides flaws but I shouldn't have to borrow Charlie Watts’s hearing aid to hear Keith’s lyrics.I know, it's only rock and roll, but I do like it and it's hard to fully appreciate a work you can't access. So download the lyrics and read along, or simply buy a Stones album where you still stand a chance of understanding 85% of Mick’s golden throat offerings."
__label__2,"I'm in closet heaven with the rubbermaid deluxe custom kit: This system is fantastic. It's inexpensive and easy to install. My husband put this together with very little help from me, in a little over an hour. Once he got the header and verticals installed, it was a snap to add the rods and shelves. I only configured the back of my walk-in using about 6ft of space because I have another system on the sides. Now that I see how well the rubbermaid system works, I'm going to change it out. I can see, reach and use everything so much better in my closet now. I really feel like I'm in closet heaven:-)"
__label__2,"Solid introductory reference: The title is very appropriate - this text provides a solid foundation in biostats. I used it for an intro course in grad school, and working through the text was very worthwhile. Previously cloudy concepts are now more clear, and I have a great reference for future use. More in-depth biostats deserves a consultation with a statistician, not a longer text. I agree with other reviewers that there are occasional mistakes (which need to be fixed - this is not even the first edition), but overall I would still highly recommend it."
__label__1,"HORRIBLE: I returned it even though i had to pay to ship it back! Should not be a kids book, it had very few pictures and no color!"
__label__2,"Excellent resource!: This book is a visual encyclopedia of Native designs, from prehistoric to recent history. Tribal art and artifacts are covered from all over, for example, there are images and sketches of Navajo sandpaintings, Eskimo clothing, Pueblo pottery, plus masks, belts, and even just basic designs! If you do beadwork, quillwork, pottery, or other Native arts, this book is a must for your library!"
__label__2,"Palahniuk's best novel yet!: Victor Mancini is Palahniuk's newest leading man. He contains many elements of Jack from Fight Club, Tender Branson from Survivor, and even the unnamed narrator from Invisible Monsters. Choke is Chuck at his best. It contains all the twists and double meanings you would expect from the writer, who in my opinion is the master of his genre. I quickly bought Choke yesterday morning (it came out yesterday) and am finished with it now. I read almost nonstop, eagerly awaiting its conclusion. Choke is yet another masterpiece. All I ask of Palahniuk is..PLEASE WRITE FASTER CHUCK!! Treat yourself and buy the book as soon as you can."
__label__1,Okay but definitly not a Classic: Vol.3 is a bad attempt by the king of new york Jigga. Jay-Hova delivers a horrible effort on this one because it has weak beats and horrible lyrics.
__label__1,"Gross! Try before you buy!: I bought a package to try and it ended up in the garbage. The crackers themselves weren't so bad, but they had a powdery coating like the cheddar flavoring had been sprayed on, and the flavor was very sour, like spoiled milk left in the car. (if you have kids you know what I'm talking about). And not just in a ""sharp cheddar"" kind of way either.The cracker itself was much thicker and more firm than I expeted, so it would probably work for dips, spreads, etc.I recommend Blue Diamond nut chips which taste like their smokey nuts in a can.I am going to give the regular Brown Rice crackers a try, But I do not recommend the cheddar."
__label__2,"Sonicare Elite Worth Buying: We were looking for toothbrush that would not break the bank while giving us all the plus features an electric brings.This was it. Pretty inexpensive as they go, works well for both of us because the stand holds 2 brush heads, so we just store there and add to brush when we're ready to use.Heed the mfg warnings though- don't take it out of your mouth while still on, or yes, you will see toothpaste everywhere! :)(true of all- I am just getting used to it)"
__label__1,"Difficult Harness: I returned this seat after 1 day because the harness was way too difficult to tighten and loosen. Rather than pull the strap you have to turn a knob to tighten and push a lever to release. It was extremely hard to do and not worth that amount of effort! I went back to BRU to see if it was just ours that was possibly defective, and the salesman said people return this seat all the time for the same reason. So I bought the Britax Roundabout."
__label__2,"Funny cute story: This is a cute story about a frog name Mr. Jeremy Fisher, who have friends over for dinner and he figured, he should catch some minnows for the. While was fishing he has quite a bit of an adventure.Another beautifully illustrated short story for children by Beatrix Potter. A good choice to read out loud to little kids during story time. I quite enjoy the short story and it's one of the stories a kid really got to have in their reading list as they are growing up."
__label__2,Good Stuff: The cape & jacket do a great job at keeping hair off you. The cape is nice in the way it covers a lot & keeps hair off.
__label__2,"My first Melanie book, can't wait to read more...: Great story, love the NYC and art references. I previewed this book before I sent it as a gift and now I will pass it along to all my friends kids. Excited to read more in the series. M in M tackles real tween issues such as changing bodies, first smooch, troubles with friends in a very realistic and honest format. Wish I had Melanie when I was a kid."
__label__1,"Too much grain: Many of these recipes cannot be used by people with grain allergies, yeast or IBS and gluten sensitivities. If you have any of these problems you'll probably want to look elsewhere."
__label__2,"My Synopsis of The Poisonwood Bible: No, this is not a new age verion of the Good Book. This is a story of a southern Baptist (white) family who travels to the Congo in the '40s and '50s on a missionary trip. The story follows the tribulations of being white, unwelcome, and unprepared while Belgium was controlling everything including the diamond trade. It is a very intelligent book, extremely well written and fully deserves all the praise it has been getting. It is mostly a story of the disintegration of a family -- 4 daughters, a tired mother, and a preacher father -- but is politically controversial enough to keep any reader interested."
__label__2,"Bit by bit: This book is well written. So detailed of the weather, colors, and scenes!It comes together like a puzzle. I really enjoyed it. It was definatly a good mystery and showed how people behave. It was a little scary, but definatly worth reading."
__label__1,"NOT WHAT I ORDERED! AND THERE WAS A HOLE IN IT!: I ordered this hat a few days ago and when it came in the mail I saw that it was NOT AT ALL like what is in the picture AND it's black instead of bright red, which is the reason why I ordered the hat in the first place. It also has a hole in it! The winter is coming very soon so I won't bother returning it now since I need it for the cold, but I will NEVER order from this seller again."
__label__2,Loved It!: This book is one of the best in her Mary Russel series! Superbly written and is a wonderful story. A must have for any Sherlock Holmes fanatic!
__label__1,"Owens can't get enough of himself: Ronn Owens' greatest admirer surely is himself, as he displays egomanical judgments on any subject dumped in his lap. Owens once speculated on air why other kids didn't like him in school. Obviously, he still doesn't get it."
__label__2,BEST PIE IRON COOKER OUT THERE!!: I HAVE HAD A ROME PIE IRON FOR YEARS AND FIND IT TO BE THE BEST COOKER TO USE OVER A CAMPFIRE. WOULD NOT HESITATE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE.
__label__1,"So Much Fluff III: Again, this book seems to lack content, as did the previous two in this series. This book seems filled with irrelevant clipart more than actual advice. Also, the annoying editing mistakes again make numerous appearances in this book suggesting it was quite rushed. Most of the advice is completely common sense, and not what I would consider ""advanced techniques"". The book begins to go over some of the information that it needs to address, but doesn't get into near enough depth. In the three book series, Andy never really goes into bluffing, what specific odds are, what specific tells people might have, etc. If you want to get a good book, I would get the book by Ken Warren ""the winner's guide to hold'em"" which goes into much more depth, and is written much better."
__label__1,"Worst effort yet: Sorry to say, but this was by far the worst Brooks & Dunn release. Even though I've always thought they were somewhat overrated, I've always been a loyal B&D CD buyer. But after this one, I would be skeptical buying more Brooks & Dunn. There's maybe two really good songs on the whole CD (including Red Dirt Road and That's What She Gets For Loving Me). The hidden track is just absolutely awful. Save your money."
__label__2,Excellent book: This is an excellent book and definitely an eye opener. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone who wants to know more about health and nutrition. The book not only tell what the health issues are but also tell you how to correct them.
__label__2,lovely again: have read this book several times--for me-it is the story of life whether man or woman--from beginning to the end--a great read
__label__2,"Bratz: My daughter got this as a gift and loves it. I do not care for the way that the Bratz dress, even in the Bratz Babyz movie. I wish they would wear age appropriate clothes. My daughter loves them."
__label__2,"The best way to introduce someone to the music of Yes.: Classic Yes was my first Yes album, bought after a friend turned me on to it during an evening of contemplative listening. While being their best 'greatest hits' package, it could have been better (as evidenced by the 4 star rating rather than 5). If it had the studio versions of 'Roundabout' and 'I've Seen All good People' it would be pretty close to perfect (the imperfect live versions work better for people who are already Yes fans). I also would have substituted either 'Siberian Khatru' or 'Sound Chaser' for 'Wonderous Stories', but that's personal preference ('Gates Of Delerium' would make it the perfect CD for long car trips!). A great introduction to one of the most exquisite progressive rock bands."
__label__1,"If you're looking for something easy to use, think again....: A nice piece of equipment with good sound. Unfortunately the documentation is substandard and the technical support is a practical joke - it's supposedly free for 60 days (not exactly generous is it?), but the catch is that it's a long-distance number and only open during office hours - you'd better be independently wealthy or have a very understanding boss.The website claims to be award-winning or some such thing but the Knowledge Base's designation flatters itself - very little knowledge.For the first two weeks I struggled to get it to record some of my favourite music. Constant problems with files not ripping or disappearing or being refused because they were apparently already on my pc. This wasn't the case and I got fed up of asking technical support for help. They'd give me answers but never to the question I'd actually asked.So, my wife has had an Ipod for months with no problems. Guess what I wish I'd bought?"
__label__2,"The Best for Toddlers.: This was my children's favorite book when they were toddler/preschoolers. I am now buying it for all my grandchildren. Pages for everyone. Trucks, farm, zoo, colors, seasons, babies all labeled individually with their name. When they are at the stage where they are repeating the name for everything this is what they liked to look through. Each child had their favorite page that we had to stop and study."
__label__1,"total piece of junk: i have had this shoddy product for about a year and i have never once gotten a good picture either with a cable connection or an antenna. just static noises and a fuzzy screen. the software is awful, and none of the updates have improved it significantly. i have an ibook running 10.1.5, and the tuner requires an audio in, which ibooks and powerbooks dont have. you can send the sound to speakers, but then the recording option is useless because theres no audio. the housing for the product is also terrible- the ports move around when you try to plug in a cable and you can hear the card moving around. i would not recommend this product at all. the only reason i havent thrown it away is because it was given to me as a gift."
__label__1,"Error 6800: This printer failed after one week with Error 6800. Canon said they would send me a replacment (but it was a conditioned unit with a slightly marred scanner glass). Unbelievably, this second unit has now failed with the same Error 6800. What a waste of time and money"
__label__2,"How does that go? ""This book saved my life..."": This was the first raw food book I ever bought and it is a powerhouse of information, from nutrition to kitchen equipment to beauty tips, it got me on the right track from the first. I successfully transitioned to raw foods, lost 50 pounds, basically put my type 2 diabetes in remission, I sleep better, have so much more energy, think more clearly and so much more. Of course, when one is looking at a cookbook, one wants to know about the recipes. They are delicious. This is still one of my favorite go to books for the basics and the elegant, alike. I give this a 5 stars, thumbs up, you won't be sorry, recommendation."
__label__1,"""I knew James Cameron. And you sir, McG, are no James Cameron!"": I had such high expectations for this film, until I started reading about the director, and my trepidation started to set-in. However, the trailers looked great, so I hoped he actually was onto something. Then literally 5 minutes into the film, when John Connor crawled out of wherever he was and everything was gone for some reason not known, I knew that my worse fears came true.The plot was very weak and completely disjointed and at time undecipherable. Christian Bale who I really like slept-walked through this role, and his whispering of his lines was extremely annoying.Why they entrusted this franchise to a music video director with a wannabe rapper/DJ name(What is up with the name McG??? Are you serious?),I have no idea. He screwed this up as badly as the Fantastic Four director (and they let him at it twice, oh no!)"
__label__1,Foolish: This book is a waste of good paper. I don't even know why anyone one would buy it!. If you want what's in this book go ask a five year old to write something for you. I know that will be much better than this mess
__label__2,Mashing Made Easy: Mashed potatoes is a pinch with this product! The press is well constructed with durable materials and dyes that easily pop out for cleaning.Pros:-heavy-quick-relatively inexpensive but good quality-easy to cleanCons (but manageable!):-heavy (another style may be better for people with joint issues)-potatoes sometimes squeeze through the top-does require scraping bottom to remove potato (apparently other styles come with a feature that swipes the bottom clean for you)

__label__2,"great for jumping and plyo/p90x 3 stars for Yoga Use: This thing is very padded. I double it's use in camping situations where I need a matt under my sleeping bag. It's a good 3/4"" thick or so.This unit works great doing p90x items like plyometrics, legs and back, kenpo etc. I was jumping barefoot and it would soak up the impacts well. In hindsight I'll probably start wearing thing shoes to further the impact on my joints. Note that b/c the unit is a bit slippy, I have to re-set it after a few setsThe negative of this unit is that it's very stretchy and has no grip. So when using yoga it will slide a bit and stretch.In the end I have two yoga mats, one for jumping workouts, and another thinnner, grippier one for yoga."
__label__1,Because I Ca R bot doing it again. NOT!!!: Do not buy this product! Does not dry clear. The sealer dries with a very profound pink tint to it. Let me be clear - THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DRY CLEAR!
__label__2,"lovely watch!: You sort of hate to give some items good reviews because then many other people will buy it (and it won't be *unique*), but I have to admit that this a great watch that I intend to have for a long time. Love that it's reversible, even though I purchased it mostly to wear on the gold side. It was also easy to remove one of the links to make it a tad shorter. All-in-all, a comfortable, attractive addition to my accessory wardrobe."
__label__1,"NOT AS ADVERTISED: I order a new pre-amp, and pretty sure I was shipped a used one. There was no manufacturer's packaging, absolutlely no paperwork of any kind, no instructions, specs, warrenty, NOTHING! Not even the name of the company that shipped it. It came in a plain package. As you can see the product comes with print on the top of it. Part of that was rubbed off as if it was used.Also beware, it does not come with a power cord even though it has a jack for a 9V power supply."
__label__1,"Jeez...: Wow, this film, it is well...cheesy. I am an absolutely HUGE Exorcist fan, but this spin-off, well, stinks. Leslie Nielson tries WAY too hard to be funny but he just doesn't deliver. All the comedy seems forced and will probably make you cringe. To tell the truth, I thought the film was kinda scary - nothing compared to The Exorcist of course but still...Linda Blair was good and pretty as always but - sheesh, don't waste you're time. Go watch the glorious original Exorcist instead of this any day of the week."
__label__2,"Old Reliable Goes One Better: This CD is addictive. George is in fine voice with a selection of tunes offering appealing melodies that seem simple at first, but display a rich complexity with further listening. He's so good with Merle Haggard songs, and ""My Life's Been Grand"" is a real treat. My favorite is ""The Middle of Nowhere."" Though the selections cover a variety of styles, this is not a disjointed bunch of songs. It's a delightful mix that will entertain many times. Pop this in your car's CD player, and you will have a more than worthy traveling companion."
__label__1,"Too short!: This strap is well-made and potentially comfortable, but at its longest length, shorter than many other straps I own. Disappointing but not worth returning."
__label__2,"Route 66 Question: Can any Route 66 fan let me know which season of RT66 had an episode filmed in Butte, Montana. A mining town in Montana, the show would have featured the gallus frames of the copper mines. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

__label__1,"Defective: It arrived with a broken closure, as I was in urgent need , I had no time to return it. It continues to crack at different places after a short time using it. The igloo I purchased directly from a store has held up!"
__label__1,"Two Stars for Art: These recent books don't appeal to me because I think they're needlessly confusing with their varying fonts and font sizes. I can't imagine what children must think, although from the other reviews some children love them. I give the two stars for the fun artwork, but in looking at the artwork the story is cast aside. One day this trend will pass away, and I will be grateful."

__label__1,"Lies: First of Jack Coughlin was never a sniper. While he may have been a fine marine that's up for debate if he has to lie about what he did to sell books.The book is full on inconsistency's and tactical errors that would most likely get you killed. Other reviewers have given plenty of fine books to read instead of this. Save your money, and if you already own this book you might as well use it to steady that wiggly leg of your coffee table it would be much better suited for that."
__label__1,"Can you say ""edit""?: After purchasing this book to prepare for the corresponding Oracle certification exam, I was extremely disappointed to find I had purchased a book that had seemingly bypassed the editor's desk. In addition to grammatical and syntax errors, there are a significant number of logical errors that only aid in reducing your chances of passing the exam. Forget the networking section entirely, it will only succeed in frustrating you.About the only good thing that I can say about this book, is that it does seem to cover all of the exam objectives-- although in a quite confusing and incomprehensible manner.My recommendation is to utilize the resources on the Oracle Technology Network. With exam objectives in hand, you can find all of the subject matter you will need to gain complete comprehension of the topics. Save your money and good luck!"
__label__1,"Sadly disappointing: Despite a promising product description, the content of this toddler Bible disappoints greatly.. in fact, it misses out Christianity. Jesus is just a 'special baby' who goes on to work miracles; and there is not even a hint of his death and resurrection. Why include the minor account of David and Goliath but miss out the Resurrection of our Lord? For toddlers, Helm's ""The Big Picture Story Bible"" is a much better choice: http://www.ecom.com/The-Picture-Story-Bible-Book/dp/1433523914"

__label__1,"Makes Hellboy look like a masterpiece.: Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie two stars. If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in negative numbers. -0."
__label__1,Extremely Cheap Quality!!!: The horn was delivered bent (bought from BikeWorldUSA) on the Flare and the Chrome was flaking along the length of the horn. The hardware to connect the horn to the bike is very very low quality and does not allow you to lock in the direction of the horn securely. Just pay the extra $5-10 at your local bike shop for a higher quality one. I am.
__label__2,"Just fine: This is not a very pricey car seat but I think it's just fine. We have bought more expensive and presumeably safer cars seats, but with twins and the need to have 4 seats, I got this one because it was lightweight and could be used more for in and out of my husband's car and family members that might take the babies. God forbid we should ever be in an accident and have to really test them out, but they seem safe and sturdy enough for older babies."
__label__1,"Truly Horrible Movie: This movie just makes you feel dirty. You leave it not liking a single character; some have said it's real life, but not my real life people. There is no reason to screw anyone over as terribly as was portrayed in this movie. Don't waste your time. I'm glad I checked it out for free from the library."

__label__1,"no go with XP: I have a new computer with XP. I wish I had seen a previous review indicating how much trouble this little device could cause. It worked erratically, so that I kept trying it with occasional success, but finally, it sent my poor computer into a kind of seizure and I had to quit. Good thing I kept my old computer so that I could print my photos-using a different smart media reader."

__label__2,"A penetrating look at a hypocritical preacher: In Babbit, Sinclair Lewis turns business into a religion. Whereas, in Elmer Gantry, Lewis turns religion into a business. Elmer Gantry is a very real portrayal of a man who is ecstatic about his religion, but it is all an outward show for profit. We might be tempted to think that the corruption evident in modern televangelists is a new occurence. Lewis proves us wrong. Lewis shows the entire spectrum of christian belief in this novel from hypocrisy, to agnosticism, to an abiding spiritual life. Despite the fact that Lewis is one of my favorite authors and this is a superior novel, there was one disappointment. Near the end of the book, Gantry is confronted by the book's one genuine believer. There was a lot of emotional tension in the scene, and I felt Lewis just let it slip away. It was an unsatisfying resolution after the build up. Beyond that one moment, It's one of the best works of fiction I have ever read."
__label__2,"This is an excellent book.: This is an excellent book if you're looking to do real magic. However, if you're worried about repercussions you should not be using this book or any other book on magic. You should be in church. It is interesting to note that several reviewers Call this a satanic book, never mind that this book and the ideas put forward in this book predate the Christian idea of a devil. Magic is not from God, unless you're foolhardy enough to believe that you can control God, as apparently many so-called white magicians believe they are. Magic is neither good nor evil, it is simply a force. So is atomic energy.That said, DO NOT loan out this book unless you intend to give it away! It is one of the Pearls out in the open."

__label__1,"health hazard: The product contents may be fine, but the pill size (22mm x 10mm x 8mm) is outrageous. I cut my first pill in half and it got stuck in my throat. After 15 minutes of not being able to either swallow or cough it up, I called 911. The paramedics wanted to take me, to the emergency room but after about another 15 minutes the pill started to dissolve enough to get into my esophagus (saving a $1000 ambulance ride). I had severe indigestion for the next 48 hours, and my throat is still swollen four days later. This product should not be on the market."

There was immediate attraction between the characters. That was the only good thing about the book. After their intial meeting, the book tends to fizzle. There was far too much arguing to suit my taste. I didn't feel that the characters knew each other so much as that they were hot for one another."

I can't stop thinking - does this woman really exist?And why not 5 stars? Only one reason, the songs doesn't really give her voice full space. Don't get me wrong, it's high class tunes, a pleasure to listen to, but they kind of set limits to her voice. The album ""Weaver of Dreams"" reveal more of the heavenly instrument she is blessed with!But, the scale 1 to 5 has been changed for me. If this album got a 4 from me, the earlier 4 star album has gone down to 3 stars.Angela, you are an angel!"

__label__1,"Don't even rent this trash.: As these movies are typically made by some small studio trying to be creative in the genre while working with an extremely small budget, I ordinarily approach zombie movies like this with a large degree of suspended disbelief. In this case, my suspended disbelief lasted only thirty minutes before I had to turn off the movie.This is not an example at even an honest effort at a good B-movie. No attempt was made at lighting, no attempt was made at audio, no attempt was made at acting. This ""movie"" looks like a bunch of guys got together on a weekend and shot this thing with a five year old mini-cam. I created better productions than this when I was in high school. After patiently enduring more than thirty minutes of college kids talking about getting some trim, waiting and hoping that the emergence of zombies would redeem this movie, no zombies came and I turned the film off."

__label__1,"Not very long lasting...: I used them on my Toyota all around and they lasted all of 4 years.One of the front shocks, the cross pin on it sheared. That should never of happened. The cross-pin corroded through and sheared off. Instead of one solid machined piece of steel, it was folded sheet metal which corroded through and rusted out. Not even the tough Rancho white paint could stop that I guess. The other front shock was blown/jammed. You couldn't compress it at all! Talk about a stiff ride...One of the rear ones leaked a bit but I could have lived with that. The other rear was fine.All of that in only 4 years of wear and tear - on road only. I'm trying other brands because Rancho is not as good as I thought."
__label__1,"Pathetic, plain and simple: This album is a mockery of Faith No More's past work. How can they call this ""Album of the Year""? It's one of the worst albums I've ever popped in my CD player. I am the biggest Faith No More fan going. I have numerous imports, posters, every single other CD, etc. and I have to say that this album is pitiful. They did the right thing in splitting up.. they were done for. This album proved it."
__label__2,Great exfoliant: I love a good exfoliant. This one can produce a lot of heat and you know your face has been scrubbed. It definitely could be too much for some people.
__label__1,"DRM sucks: Only 3 installs? I don't care how good a game is, overly restrictive DRM ruins it.I pre-ordered the game from ecom, but I am going to return it unopened unless EA does something about this DRM nightmare.Sorry Will Wright, you picked the wrong publisher."
__label__1,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME: There is a serious programming flaw in this game. A ""warning"" window pops up every few minutes (unless your PSP is fully charged AND plugged in!). This is INCREDIBLY annoying and I am returning the game. The manufacturer won't even acknowledge that there is a problem so I am NEVER buying another UBISOFT product again!"
__label__1,"More action, please.: Too many pages dedicated to character analysis and development, and when the action finally comes, it is at times murky and unclear. One example is the rescue of Tor from the doomed space shuttle. What should have been a quick and dirty rundown of a rescue just plodded on and on, and the characters weren't realistically reacting to a panic-inducing situation. I can't helpfully summarize what happened in the rescue because the scene was obtusely drawn and prone to lateral observations that just dragged the action down to grim entropic boredom.I read the book word-for-word to about halfway, and then after being let down by multiple mini-anti-climaxes, I had to skim. I found that you could skim 10-20 pages at a shot and not really miss much in the way of action or general plot. What then, fills these many pages? I don't know, don't really care, probably won't buy another McDevitt novel, and wouldn't recommend this to anyone but the dreadfully bored."

Many tedious scenes of author napping, eating slowly, typing, soiling his pants and even climbing out of the tub with gross old rear end in plain view. Oy vey!"
__label__1,"Not that useful without an index!: This map is 19"" x 35"". It has a cardboard fold over cover to protect it when not in use and glossy paper.Unbelievably, there is no town index!! Their description above should have stated that.Disappointing."
__label__2,"Great Cam: Let me say that this cam is exceptionally well for its size. The best modes are the portrait and the landscape mode. this cam provides a very good grip which makes taking pictures very stable. The shooting modes are fairly easy to grapse. This camera is fairly light compared with the SD series. As with all powershots, the lens can be removed and additional lens can be added to shoot pictures with even better quality. This makes the A520 a must have for amateurs to regular photo makers.However there are a bit of technical difficulties. The ""Pets"" mode doesn't do a good job on the pets. This cam requires good lighting from the cam/surrounding to make pictures crisp and sharp.See sample pics from yahoo search. The pictures here devalue the cam's abilities.Good luck"
__label__1,Not Even Worth the One Star: Movies just don't get any worse than this.I had to give it at least one star but it doesn't even deserve that. The only way you will ever get through film is to watch the review made by the Phantom Reviewer- he at least made it good for a few laughs and it wasn't meant to be a comedy.
__label__2,Hilarious Story: Once in a while you need to watch a Comedy and this one is great. The Ending was to predictable.
__label__2,"Perfect leave in treatment!: I have naturally frizzy - I mean curly hair. An amount of this Coconut Oil treatment the size of a quarter smooths and seals my hair without the greasy look that frizz-ease or other silicone treatments leave. It's worth every penny to have frizz free curls this summer. I've used it as a ""hot oil"" type treatment, it's ok for that, but as a leave in it yields great results!"
__label__2,Beautiful sound: Beautifully made with great workmanship. These are not your ordinary run of the mill chimes. Rich strong sound you will be able to enjoy for years. Definitely a sound investment in beauty and tranquility.
__label__1,"Mostly unlistenable: I have heard virtually all of the Dead's recorded output and generally like them, but isn't this really an album which is more interesting to think about than it is fun to actually listen to? A grand experiment which mostly failed. Needed a rigorous editing job and someone to say ""no"" to the excesses which wreck it. The live versions of these songs on other Dead albums, recorded during the same time period, are far superior."
__label__2,Eureka 5550A Maxima Upright Bagless Vacuum: I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my mother (with fears that it may be inferior because of the low cost.) She and I were both amazed at the power this light-weight vacuum has. She tried it out immediately and it sucked up so much dirt/dust out of the carpeting (that she had just finished vacuuming with a much more expensive older vacuum). It's also very light in weight and easy to handle. Truly a wonderful product!
__label__1,"less than rubish: You have got to be joking me, some people have given this 4 stars, if only you could give numbers below 1. I fell in love whith the song 'Oh my god i can't belive it' so ui decided to buy the album. But as i listen to the songs on the album it was 11 of the worst songs i have ever heard. I mean im more of a hip hop fan but every once in a while i like to listen to abit of rock but this album was so rubish it hurt my ears. Listening to this album hurts more than a toothache. I put it on my ipod and listen to the rest and i realised i had just wasted 30 minutes of my life. 30 minutes that i will never get back. please if your thinking of buying this album listen to what im saying, because the media might fool you into buing this garbage."
__label__2,"The annexation of Puerto Rico!: Classic!The Little Giants is a great film for all ages, and I recommend buying it. The only problem I have with this item is that it is in one of those cardboard movie cases. I feel that plastic does a much better job at keeping the disc clean and protected. Other than this flaw, it was well worth it."
__label__1,Nothing good: Didn't like itI wasn't like the old games that I enjoyed playing. Hard to access different levels. I played it once and now its just sitting in my room.
__label__2,"THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL!: For me, at least. It was the gift of this book that set me on the course of living rightly. Even though I am not a Zen student, the lessons of Zen apply to all Buddhist seekers, and I am eternally grateful that I encountered this unpretentious, wonderful little book."
__label__1,"not his best: Hemingway wrote many good things, but this isn't one of them. The title refers to a poem by John Donne, in which the poet seems to suggest that the tribulations of any humans are the business of others as well. Hemingway has applied this notion to the Spanish Civil War, of which he was a first-hand witness. The plight of the Spaniards here should be the concern of all of us. The problem is, his point is clearly made by the title, and the rest of the book does nothing to improve upon it. This long tome about rebels trying to blow up a bridge ends poorly; the characters don't arouse too much sympathy, and the whole thing goes nowhere, except where the fine title has already taken it."
__label__2,"The movie of ""Trouble River"": This is a great movie. A mom, dad, Grandmother, and the parents son live a good ways from the city. The parents are haveing a baby and they need to get to the city. They go and leave the boy and grandmother at the house. They sea an indian so they build a raft and go down ""The rouble River."" Will they survive?"
__label__1,"Cheap, poorly made and even worse designed: Just tried installing the double trigger and guard on my A5 and while the trigger fits where it's supposed to, the guard that showed up with the trigger was much too small! It was like one committee designed the double trigger and another committee on the other side of the world designed the guard and they never talked. Without the guard the item is useless. Very disappointed."
__label__2,Excellent Read: This book is a wonderful resource and guide for my teens. They have read it and love it. I highly recommend it to those of you with children entering or already in high school!
__label__2,Slurping good time: My son got this for Christmas and has been making slurpys every day. He read the instructions and followed the directions himself with much of no help from me.
__label__2,Breastfeeding Essentials: I love this product it has everything I needed to get started with my new born. And the price was great if you added up each piece and got them piece by piece you would pay some much more. Great deal for the money.
__label__2,"good for traveling!: Good quality. No issues with the game. bought it for my husband. like that you can fold it easily and all the pieces stay put. picked this board so that my toddler couldn't get a hold of the pieces. she hasn't yet! it is a little smaller than i expected, but it's not too small. you can easily bring it camping or on a trip."

__label__1,"Genre is acquired taste and this is the worst of this genre: This genre of Asian centrefold is not for everyone but for lovers of this style, this is easily the worst one. She's an attractive, slender model but the video is boring for the initiated let alone the casual viewer. SHe wanders around with the top of her dress around her waste for an hour and it looks as though this has been censored for sone scenes. A waste."
__label__1,"Weak and watery: I gave this two stars, one for aroma, and one for recyclable paper packaging instead of foil or Mylar.I thought I would give this tea a try since my usual blackcurrant tea was no longer available on ecomPrime. I was hopeful, and it did smell nice in the bag. I should have known better. I did my usual two bags of tea (a big 20oz. American coffee mug, not a teacup) and when I sampled it I was shocked the water barely changed color. I added two more bags, and even after four bags and a log steep: still, watery, weak color and weak flavored tea that, all right, smelled nice. This brand might be fine for most people who seem to like weak and watery tea, but if you prefer a robust and full flavored tea, stick to Twinings or Ahmed, it'll be worth the wait."
__label__2,"The House of Sand: This foreign film was heartbreaking and heartwarming. It was very interesting to see how the characters develop throughtout the film, there is a short part where the audience is left wondering who is who in the story but then it is all quickly revealed. Very well written film. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
__label__1,"Dissapointing Game/ Customer Service: Even though the graphics are fair, the most annoying part of this game is server stability. I could not stay connected for more than few minutes at a time(and I'm on a T1 connection). When I did eventually find a sysop to help me, he tried to tell me that the connection problems were all my fault. After I had explained that I never have have any problems with any other games, he became defensive and rude. And this guy represents this company??? I won't reccomend this game to anybody."
__label__1,"Silly story: I saw this when it first came out. Maybe because of all the explosion and shooting, I didn't realize how stupid the story was. No wonder it totally bombed at the box office, even with Clooney and Kidman. This ain't 007 or Die Hard, so don't try to be one. I just hope that the real peacemakers are smarter than this. If you are not ready to simply turn off your brain for two hours, skip it. But if you still want to judge it for yourself, then stop reading.1. The fighting scene on the bridge is ridiculous. Is this how US army works, I mean sending one person down to kill all the enemy, then the rest of the team joins him?2. If you know a nuclear bomb is coming into NY, you don't sit in the office and wait for someone to tell you the flight has already landed.3. You have an FBI team to capture someone, do you send everyone to his room, leaving nobody to watch the exits?This just goes on and on."
__label__2,"Scary and excellent: This is a really scary book, but it is SO WORTH reading. I've been into forensic psychology and the criminal mind for years, and this is a book that will give you an outstanding insight and really affect you.What I appreciate very much with this book is that it was written by an man who lived it, rather than an expert on the subject (although you have to ask, what makes an expert if not the man who lived it?). It's not the usual, cynical, calculating psychology that many experts reduce themselves to, but a very alive and emotional story. The result is extraordinary."
__label__1,"If you like shoddy craftsmanship, then purchase this player: I bought this player off of Tigerdirect, and it was great for about 3 months. (minus horrible battery life and small storage capacity, even w/ the extra 32mb backpack). After the first three months, it simply stopped working. Wouldn't turn on, no response at all.Wrote SonicBlue, after a couple of weeks of going back and forth and finally convincing them that it wasn't a firmware update issue, they agreed to 'let' me mail it to them (at my cost) and they would repair or send me a replacement. i guess they did replace it, but after about three months of use, i am getting the same problems again. I wish I had believed other reviews about this product. If you're into masochism, then by all means, get this thing. if not, save up for an iPod or anything else but Rio. You get what you pay for...

__label__1,"No time for this junk!: This clock is junk!! I bought this in August of 2011 and by early November 2011, it no longer works. I changed the battery but it still loses about 20 minutes every day. What good is that? Don't buy it."
__label__1,"A RIP OFF: I thought this DVD of The Flip Wilso show which RHINO was selling was going to be really funny . I played it and I nearly fell asleep all they did was sit at a table talk and play cards . And when they played a "" funny skit "" Laughable it wasn't ! This DVD would look better in the bottom of a waste basket ."
__label__2,"Great TV series.: Combat is one of the great TV shows of the 60s. Great acting and wonderful stories. Very realistic war scenes for its time(no CGI, of course). I bought all the seasons and have not seen a bad episode. If you have an interest in WWII, I recommend this series. I am just waiting for the 12 O'Clock High TV series to be released on DVD. That is also and excellent WWII TV series from the 60's."
__label__2,Love it!: I was worried this would be to greasy. But it was the opposite. Kept my skin soft all day. And the smell is great also.
__label__1,"Weakest of the bunch: I love Alex Kava, but this book is the weakest of the Maggie O'Dell series. People are forgotten in the book and never reapper, it seems as if the ending was rushed."
__label__2,"Mother Smith plays a fanfare on the organ!: Excellent read. I did not find it boring at all. I loved the characters Neighbor Dorothy and Minnie Oatman. Although the book is set in Missouri, it is quite Southern in its quirky and subtle humor."
__label__2,"Light hearted fun: Georgette Heyer was extremely fond of the lethargic, intelligent, sarcastic male character; it was inevitable that she will make such one into a hero in one of her novels. Both the hero and the heroine are extremely appealing characters; the plot is rather simplistic for a Heyer novel (even for her romance), but the characterization of the hero (see above) and of Penelope more than make up for it. Penelope is indeed one of my favorite Heyer females; she is intelligent, charming and innocent, and is believably appealing for such a character as the hero to be (finally) a woman whom he can fall in love with. A gender switch confusion adds to the fun (though it's not made too much of). Strongly recommended."
__label__2,Had the DVD version too: I had this for my first DVD player in like 1996 and loved it. I had to get the blu-ray version too. Great for tweaking your system and also has some great sample content for wow'ing the friends and family.
__label__1,"What is the big deal?: I know I am not supposed to ask that, lest I incur the wrath of Jordan zealots with their poorly spelled, overly-punctuated, loudly capitalized reviews. You've got to wonder what an author has to inspire almost Oprah-like devotion.I'm not sure it's talent, because while he is the best writer of the current bunch of Tolkein imitators (which is not necessarily heaping praise; Brooks and Goodkind are two of the most average writers around), he's fooling people with a huge marketing gimmick (Wheel of Time saga? Please, put it in thee volumes and think up something new) and fragmented, verbose plots with recycled themes and wooden characters.It's entertaining for what it is, a wordy fairy tale."
__label__1,"Hildegard: I Wanted the movie Vision The story of Hildeguard. Yes the movie you sent is about the same woman but although the movie you sent me is about her story, is not near the quality of the latest movie ""Vision the story of hildeguard"". the sound of the movie you sent was poor, and to compensate that, it did not have subtitles available. Vision is a great movie about Hildeguard with amazing quality of colors, sound and scene and that makes a difference in a movie."

__label__1,"About as punk as Justin Timberlake: Don't even call this punk. It isn't. Also, if you like the one single you heard as their video, still avoid this overly produced, syrupy pure pop record. There is nothing punk about this album, and that single is the only good song on it. Save your money and your time. You'll be glad you did."

__label__1,"Didn't work: Unfortunately, this classic game simply didn't work on my Windows XP box.My daughter loves the game at school, where they must run older versions of Windows. But when we installed it at home, it started up with jerky sound that went mute after a minute. A few screens into the game, the cursor disappeared when she was balancing a scale and there was no way to progress past that screen."
__label__1,Catherine called Birdy: I read a book called Catherine called Birdy. it was a historical novel. I thought the book was quite boring because it wasn't very easy to get into. Basically it was about a girl called Catherine who was nicknamed Birdy.It was an old fashioned book because Birdy's father was selling her to all these suitors and she didn't like or know any of them. There wasn't a very good storyline to the story and it didn't make me feel as if I couldn't put the book down. If there are any sequels I don't particularly want to read them.
__label__2,"Clear and Helpful Resource for your Sewing Library: The author has a clear writing style, provides clear and helpful illustrations and not only summarizes critical procedures, but gives some fine-tuned tips and tricks on established techniques that are necessary to produce quality, professional-looking results. Avoid the Heidi Klume ""it looks home sewn"" assessment, and apply the techniques learned from this book to any kind of top, blouse, or project. It's not just for t-shirts.Shortly before this book was published, the author appeared on Sandra Betzina's ""Sew Perfect"" show (former show on HGTV) to discuss how to create bias-cut garments, pattern layout issues, and fabric recommendations (like a forgiving linen). Many of those tips are in this book."

__label__1,"defective disc Number 4: This review pertains to the audiobook cd set. Disc 4 had some kind of flaw that would stop the disc and keep it stuck in the drive, impossible to eject by normal means. So I used a paper clip in the tiny hole to open the drive and remove the disc. I tried it in another drive. Same problem. I returned it to ecom. ecom sent a replacement. I tried Disc 4. Same problem. I returned it to ecom and asked for a refund. Very disappointing."
__label__2,"Wonderful New Insights: I loved this book. I recently read it to for a paper I was writing on woman's suffrage, and was initially concerned the focus on North Carolina would be too narrow to serve my purposes. However, Gilmore's research and analysis of the role played by black middle class women after Reconstruction and the multi-layered conflicts in southern society around enfranchisement, economic security and cultural and masculine identity is eye-opening. Gilmore's exposure and explanation of the invidious 'propaganda wars' conducted by white supremacists do much to explain regional antipathy to equal rights for both African Americans and women.P. Abeles"
__label__1,"Chris: It may be very different if you listen to the CD through head phones, but it is hard to listen to it in your car. When you listen to it in your car there are characters that scream in your ear while they talk and others you cannot here (because of the special audio mix). Also, did they review this CD before they released it? The child actor is just reading his lines, he does not act like the others. I thought the story was ok, but they should have left you with an ending. I would say it was worth about less than half of what I paid for it."
__label__2,"Bruce Willis doesn't have to be Daniel Day or Robert DeNiro...: Daniel Day or Robert DeNiro never acted in movies like Bruce Willis. And as good as they are as actors, they can never play an every man as effectively as Bruce Willis. I bought ""Surrogates"" on dvd, watched it, and thought it was a pretty good movie. Bruce Willis is a gifted actor, who plays his roles very well. Willis is able to elevate drama, tension and action to its fullest on-screen."
__label__2,"Stop teasing me!: Enough already! I loved the first book, and the second is no exception . . . but several plot twists, hooks, thingamignies - what ever you want to call them are not explained. So where does that leave me? Desperately wanting book three!For those of you who may not have read Keith's first book (I take some sort of pity on you, as you obviously live on a desert island some where in the pacific) this second installment takes off like a marathon runner and shows no signs of stopping, right up to the last page.Very nice Mr. Hartman, I'm looking forward to knowing more about Daniel."

__label__2,"Simple, Yet Eloquent Novel: One of the reviewers of ""The Namesake"" remarked that it flows so effortlessly that the reader forgets he or she is reading a novel. I had exactly the same experience. ""The Namesake"" is about an immigrant family from India and their struggles to adapt in America, but more importantly, the novel speaks to relationships and rituals of family, country and love in a manner that is so simple, yet so elegant, controlled and profound. Ms. Lahiri has her detractors who say that nothing happens in this novel; I am reminded of critics of Austen who have said the same thing. However, this novel tells a very believable story that is animated by the author's ability to captivate the reader with unadorned prose that is never false or tentative. I am truly amazed that this is only her second work of fiction. Think of Hemingway or Kent Haruf."

__label__1,"Annoying Drivel: Several of the most annoying people I've ever known drone on incessantly about how they're going to be millionaires by obsessively following this book's commands. I glanced at it in the bookstore at it seemed to be resemble most diet plans, i.e. eat less and exercise. If I understand correctly, if I spend less, put my money in mutual funds, and devote all my waking hours to accumulating money, I can join the ranks of people with a million dollars. Ge, no thanks, I think I'll keep my personality the way it is, and read some decent novels instead of this drivel. May I recommend Thomas Pynchon as a start? Or maybe a tome of history, say, C. Vann Woodward?"
__label__1,Missed some of the obvious shortcomings: The author was unwilling or unable to deal the renorming of college entrance exams (such as SAT)which is one of the most observaable demonstration of increasingly poor academic performance. By treating increasingly poor academic performance as a myth the author lost credibility.
__label__2,Very fun but could be better: I love this game. My only suggestion is that the houses and hotels should look like houses and hotels instead just like the game board tokens. The properties run the spectrum from landfill to high end real estate so it'd be more fun to see a realistic building(s)that corresponds to the property. Even better would be several building styles from which to choose.

About the only thing my son has enjoy about his toy is pushing the buttons to make noises. It's a cute idea but it needs to be better built in my opinion. I would not and am glad I did not spend the money on this.
__label__1,"a horror: I have either liked or loved all of Frank Peretti's works up to this point, but this was a horror to read (in more ways than one.) It was like reading a book based after a cheap SyFy channel horror story. The whole book was dark, confusing and actually rather boring. I only finished the book because I ALWAYS finish a book if I make it through the first few chapters. I also didn't think that the vague spiritual message was worth much (if anything.) Maybe this type of book is worth reading for some, but I found it was vastly different from the quality I am used to from Peretti. (I imagine Dekker's influence on the book had a large part of that.)"

I chose the 5.1 audio setup & pressed play. but to my horrors of horrors, the sound that was coming out from my system was so unbearable to listen to. I know the title of the Dvd is 'Live & Raw' but it can't really be that bad, right? I believe this is a bootleg recording & it's not cheap also. The classic songs are there but you need to have good audio to really appreciate them or it's going to piss you off. So this gets only 1 star from me. Buy at your own risks!!!"
__label__1,"Don't waste your money...: Or time on this turkey. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of both, Alex Cord and Samantha Eggar. But, even these two talented actors couldn't make this amateurish and ill written piece of tripe worth watching. In fact, I have to confess, I didn't watch most of the film, it was too tedious to wade through."
__label__2,"Love this movie: I had always wanted to see this movie and when I found it for the price I did I could not pass it up. It is truly one of the great character pieces I have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like romance movies this one is still worth a watch."
__label__1,"Find another scale: We've had this scale for a few months now and we're shopping for a new one. I guess the old ""you get what you pay for"" applies in this case. The readings fluctuate every time we get on it. We often get on the scale 3 times and take the average of the 3 readings. And because we can't trust the weight readings, we never use the BMI function either. It's a small scale and would probably be ok for someone who only weighed occasionally. But if you're monitoring your weight on a regular basis, don't buy this one."

I've tried the drive on a few computers no exception yeah DWF DWF DWF......one time the DWF even corrupted 20GB of my data the dead sector is still there sitting. I've learned my lesson with these pathetic drives I'd recommend all of you to buy hard drive enclosure instead and fit it with your own desired internal hard drive yes a little troublesome but well worth the fuss coz it will last and wont just stop responding while plugged in.I've heard that Seagate makes internal drives of admirable quality but they have failed big time on these external drives
__label__1,Bad Edition: I would not buy this edition. The printing is terribly small. Its about half the size of normal print. And there is no introduction. Usually these types of works have some sort of preface which introduces the reader to the material.
__label__1,"Horrible Picture quality, banding issues. Good Audio: TV properly broken in. Using S-Video inputs. Using DVD and DirecTV sources.Problems:1. banding that everyone talks about2. picture quality is bad. i tried every setting in the menus to tweak it. color reproduction and fragmentation are the notably bad effects.3. my remote died after a year. prob due to bad batteries. but nonetheless, other remotes of mine have stood up to that b4.the ergonomics of the remote is horrible btw. really really bad.Good stuff:1. surround sound is awesome for a tv. but doesn't matter or come into effect if u use a 5.1 system externally."
__label__1,"Average: This compilation is not bad, and is not good. It's average. Here is too many songs from Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones?. They could put here more songs from Laundry Service. I don't recommend to buy it. It's only for die-hard fans."
__label__2,Fantastic Book: This is an awesome book. There is a related video that makes many of the exercises even more clear.I have found that combining many of these exercises with the overall program listed in The Complete Guide to Navy SEAL Fitness by Stewart Smith is a winning combination. Mr. Tsatsouline's exercises are more efficient and when worked into the overall program in Mr. Smiths book produce great results.

Even Ed Wood would have been embarressed. Don't buy it, you should be paid to take it!"

He needed some help getting the hooks out of the fish and this works great with his little hands. It fits nicely in his tackle box and the wood grain makes it look really nice. I am sure he will out grow it or end up dropping it in the lake but for the price i can afford to buy him another one later.

__label__2,"Helpful book about communication..: I had trouble relating to this book from the beginning. Talking from the heart? What the hell does that meanand how do you do it? Well, if you persist and continue reading, you will find helpful strategies thatyou can use in your daily life in diffusing explosive situations.I found it helpful analyzing how we react to stressful situations: in particular how we create stories to explainthe events and behaviours that we observe. It is not clear to me how effective these methods are in real life.But it is always the first step in understanding what makes us upset, furious, confused, etc.If you are in a field like engineering (I am), it is difficult to read this book. But I think it is a greatbook in improving your communication skills."
__label__1,"bubble gum disco crap: this disc is horrible. I bought this the other day at the local Best Buy, in the reggae section, thinking it was another collection of great Jimmy Cliff songs. I had not heard most of them, so I was all over it. When I threw it in the car stereo, I almost cried. It is horrible. Bubble gum disco crap. Every song is too happy, to the point it is cheesey. It is watered down, and doesnt have live instrumentation, it is pop music with a hint of a jamaican accent. Long live roots reggae, and down with crossover crap."
__label__1,"If you like to find meaning in meaninglessness...: This is the first book in a long time that I can say that I did not like despite it being very well written. Maybe I just don't like the genre of surrealistic existentialism. It's difficult for me to put my finger on what I disliked. I didn't like the scenes of intense and graphic violence. I didn't like not caring about the protagonist (who also seemed not to care about anything himself). There are other things I didn't like as well, but, ultimately, it wasn't any one thing that turned me off. I'm sure that some might say that those things that I disliked were exactly the point (the meaninglessness is the meaning!). Frankly, I just found it tedious.The writing (and/or translation) was good, though, so maybe I'll give his memoir about running a try..."

__label__1,"Completely Useless!!!: Looking at moving from a 355 to 360 so thought I would be prudent and pick up this buyer's guide. Before buying my 355 I read through a million forum posts on fchat and flife and learned all I needed to look for in buying a 355 (manifolds, bypass valve, fuel lines, etc.). Expecting that a ""Buyer's Guide"" would tell you things like this to look out for on the 360, I read it in complete disbelief. This is little more than a guy who bought one talking about his car and providing a couple useless tips like ""spray water on the car and it should bead up immediately""!!! Seriously? You need to put that in a buyer's guide? How about some detail on how to know the variators are bad or some discussion on the exhaust manifolds rather than whether or not the car has been waxed! He literally says to ""take a look in the engine bay."" For what? Take a look and marvel? That's what I mean by useless info. Don't buy, complete piece of junk."

But that excitement quickly faded on the second day when I couldnt get the x3 to pair with my Treo. Numberous attempts were made without success. Finally I called tech support at BlueAnt and the tech advised me that the x3 was not compatible with the Treo 700p. The Tech at BlueAnt was very Helpful and advised me to try one of the Plantronics bluetooth earpieces, which I did and it works very well. I contacted DataVision which sold me the x3 on ecom, and was told by the rep that I could NOT return the product and DataVision would NOT refund my money because the product had been opened. The rep was very Rude and not helpful at all! I will NEVER purchase another product from DataVision again!"

Upon reading, I was relieved to realize that this book is one full of hope, not despair, sadness and pain. These are the stories of real people who have had or do have real cancer. The book is invaluable because it comes from those people who know what having cancer feels like. These aren't the words of doctors or nurses or other health care professionals. These are the words from people who know."
__label__2,"Rhythmically hypnotic.: Not a huge fan of either the Grateful Dead or electronic samples, I was a little bit apprehensive about buying this disc. However, once I actually listened to it, I was hooked. Mickey Hart and his fellow musicians take us on a trip around the world with their unique blend of traditional African and South American percussion instruments and electronically-enhanced samples. It serves as excellent background, mood music. Check out ""Yabu"" featuring Babatunde Olatunji... Rhythmically hypnotic."
__label__1,Interesting thought but no plot and no characters: The book started off ok. A prehistoric shark could still be alive at the bottom of a trench. From that point forward the story just fell apart. The plot was one dimensional and no time or effort was spent on developing the characters.The story put itself in situations of suspense but none of them were believeable. After awhile you just stop believing any of it and you just want it to be over.The back cover says this book is for fans of Cussler and Crighton. Well I like both of those authors and this book captures only the worst of those 2.

They are really cute.3) The design of the shoe makes the foot appear smaller.4) Shoe is great for people that have wide feet.Negatives:1) Although the bedding of the shoe is soft and cushioned, the strap/buckle that goes across the toes hurts! The plastic is too hard against the toes and digs in every time you take a step. It pinches the toes. Hopefully I will wear these shoes in so the plastic won't hurt anymore. I think Dr. Scholls should have kept in mind comfort when making the strap that goes over the feet as well (not just the bedding of the shoe).2) Shoe runs a bit small.

The UK and Europe versions of this same CD have another live recoding of Iron Maiden on it...I love Maiden I have seen them play over 20 times here in California and in Europe, but please I don't need to hear another live version of Iron Maiden...having saying that this CD is definately worth the buy and if you are a die hard fan than find a way to get the UK version of this as well as it has a live photo of the band during the Matter of Life and Death tour.

__label__2,"A spectacular read dah-lin'!: This is a book about the bonds that can tie imperfect people together and make them stronger. Vivid description and at times very funny but also very touching- especially if you've lived in the South-- or have a mother! The characters and their adventures are memorable; it's one of those books you read over and over. Far superior to ""Little Altars Everywhere"", the book this is a sequel to. Rebecca Wells obviously matured as a writer after writing Little Altars, which does not have to be read to understand this book (in fact I would say don't read it at all, just enjoy Divine Secrets). Divine Secrets is bound to be a favorite book passed from mother to daughter-- or in my case daughter to mother! Enjoy!"

The reviews and everything else(the price...)made me expect a sensationnel album.What a disappointment!...well, lets put it this way: if you love yonni, enya, dido, moby you will probably love this!If you like something less commercial sounding like:massive attack, portishead,kruder and dorfmeister,costes by stephane pompougnac,dj cam,do yourself a favor and save your bucks.Where was ""music fan"" of new york when I bought this?! I totally agree with him I feel ripped off!"
__label__1,"Bad stuff: This is a known poison used in nerve gas. It will make your animal terribly sick, and can even kill it. If you call the company and complain hard enough they will pay for the vet bills, but they should really ban this product."
__label__1,Micah: I love Anita Blake but her last few books have been nothing (...). The ONLY reason I still read her is because when she does finally get away from the endless sex and tells the stories she is so awesome about creating I fall in love with her all over again. This could have been three chapters only and been just perfect for the story she wanted to tell.To be honest this will be the last book I purchase of hers. I can get porn free.
__label__1,"Please don't buy this adapter.: For the sake of your sanity and the peacefulness of you neighborhood, please don't bother buying this adapter. It may lead to uncontrollable bouts of screaming. I have another computer which picks up our wireless signal fine, but with this adapter the signal is frequently dropped. Unplugging and plugging it back in usually gets it online again for at least a few minutes, but it's a big pain in the neck. Having to do this repeatedly meant keeping it plugged into the front of the computer within reach, which meant that it got knocked into frequently because it sticks out a good 3"" from the computer. Now it has come apart and has to be replaced. Piece of cr@p."
__label__2,City of God: I received my order on time and in perfect condition. I would definately buy from this seller again.
__label__2,"Not that much rumble: For subwoofers placement is key and can make or break your subwoofer. I have mine in a corner-ish spot, but it still doesn't give that chest pounding bass. Oh well, It's small so that's good for me because I'm using it with my PC.I have this connected to a Harmon Kardon Hk3390 receiver and On the back of the sub I set the volume 3/4 and on the receiver I set the bass knob to 3/4 aswell maybe it is defective because there the subwoofer only responds when the volume is 3/4 or higher. One thing to note is that it is very musical, it's not like those massive one note car subs that only go boom."
__label__2,"A sensitive story about a battle against ignorance.: My first novel by Pat Conroy. I was really intrigued by this piece of work and I'm not sure exactly why. I guess in thinking back that perhaps that it was simply a well-written novel. Conroy has a fine way with words and a real feel for the plight of people. As a teacher, I had a tough time visualizing the situation on the island, but I had no trouble understanding the politics. I enjoyed this book, talked it up and now I am moving on to PRINCE OF TIDES."
__label__2,"Wonderful: I am very pleased with this CD. There is more than 75 minutes of music and it includes all of B.J. Thomas's hits. I rate 6 of the songs as very good or excellent. My favorites are ""No Love At All"", ""Rock & Roll Lullaby"" and ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"".I agree with the other reviewers that this is the one to buy for a B.J. Thomas collection."
__label__1,"Worst printer I have ever owned: Among the problems:1. Updating drivers has been a mess. The computer thinks there are multiple printers on line.2. Paper jams are more frequent than with any printer I've owned.3. The paper feeder for the scanner has never once worked properly.4. The scanner software is confusing with no decent instruction.5. Wireless printing has been intermittent.6. The printheads are already nonfunctioning (in less than three months)!7. Ink costs are not as low as I was led to believe. (Should have heeded other reviewers' advice on this.)Kodak, what has happened to you? You used to set the standards for the rest of your industry!"
__label__1,"Let's put it together: Over 300 reviews so far, let's summarize the half of them (although I found many very funny): Cornwell's first 3-4 Scarpetta novels were, without a doubt, excellent. These books had a good storyline and believable characters, but in the meantime the series has hit rock bottom and started digging. I am so fed up with Kay's constantly miserable life! Lucy is a spoiled brat and she should have been killed instead of Benton (although he was pretty boring too). What happened to Marino? Come Ms Cornwell, you owe your readers more than this poor little effort. I agree with another reader that Cornwell should write a psychiatrist into her next novel and get her characters a therapy.If there's no other way then end the Scarpetta series and start something new. This is not the way to go! As far as I am concerned I won't waste money on another book. This is so depressing!"
__label__1,"Something Loose Inside !: I received the breadmaker, and when I was taking it out of the box, I noticed something rattling inside the bread maker. I noticed that there was a Chinese ""QC Passed"" sticker on the bottom of the machine. Great job guys.I tried to take the bottom off the breadmaker, but it won't come off. I guess that I will have to leave the loose screw or whatever it is , inside until it shorts out the electrical components. It's not worth the $15.00 shipping to return it for a new one. I was hoping for a little better quality for a $60.00 BREAD MACHINE !"
__label__1,"Very disappointed: I have had several Panasonic phones in the past, always have been happy. So, when I decided to upgrade and get a new phone with the 5.8 GHz (must be even better than 900 or 2.4, right??) Boy, was I disappointed. At first, I was very happy. It looks nice, flashes several colors when it rings, can pick ""sing songy"" ring tones. On the second day of use, I was having a hard time hearing the other person. I blamed it on their phone, mine was, after all brand new. It couldn't be my new phone. On the 3rd day, I was barely able to hear anyone on the other end at all. I'd run to the old phones in the house to use to continue my conversation. By the end of the week, I would answer the phone, the person could hear me, I couldn't hear them at all!! That was it. The phone went back. I'm sticking to my old phones and shopping around a little more. I'm going to check with consumer reports next time. Don't buy this phone."
__label__1,"Poor quality transfer of a poor quality movie: Bought because I am a fan of 80's arcade games. This makes most 'B' movies look good. Quality of transfer was poor - some scenes very dim, sound volume goes up and down.Save your money and watch Porky's again."
__label__2,"Cheater tire for off road: I run this tire on my KTM520 with a extra heavy duty tube and found two rims locks mandatory due to the incredible traction and the low pressure I run. (7-10psi)I'm getting triple the mileage vs a standard knobby with no discernible loss of traction throughout the tires life as with a worn knobby.Rocks, roots, mud, snow, ice, are no problem for this tire, and it tracks much straighter and smoother through loose terrain. It's only weak point can sometimes be deep, bottomless pea gravel but it still makes it through.Saves your energy for the tough spots and doesn't tear up the terrain."
__label__1,"Being liked is more important than being your unique self.: This story doesn't teach sharing; it teaches of giving away your unique identity, conforming to fit in and be liked by those who are nothing but greedy little beggars who withhold friendship from those who don't conform to their demands. Is this the ocean or is it my high school from 20 years hence? Children are better to be told stories about liking themselves rather than stories of doing whatever it takes to be liked by others.It's doubtful the two sides will agree on this book, but I suggest that before buying this it, take a moment to read it and determine the message for yourself.A better story about sharing is Donna Jakob's My New Sandbox."
__label__1,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This gate is suppose to expand easily to 60 inches to fit large openings. It advertises that you can adjust it to with ease. It is suppose to be pressure-mounted. They say it is easy to move and will not damage door frames. It is all a lie. The gate is impossible to expand and/or make smaller. You CANNOT move it with ease once it is pressure mounted. And, when we tried to remove it from the wall - it left a hole the size of a tennis ball.It is a poorly constructed, horrible gate. Our gate was defective since it cannot be made longer or shorter. We have tried to get in touch with customer service to return the gate and no one has called us back. RUN - DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS VENDOR - choose another gate!!!!"
__label__2,Great for presents: This is very nice tape to use for gifts. It's not as easy to see on the gift. It has a nice stickiness to it. I'd recommend it.
__label__1,"Boring: boring, too long and drawn out, not much to the story. Repetitive, predictable, kept waiting for something to happen different."
__label__2,"Romance in a historically accurate Singapore of the 30 & 40s: This classic romance a la ""Romeo and Juliet"" is set inthe Singapore of the 1940s. A Chinese and a British arenot an acceptable couple even if they have shared theirchildhood. The backdrop is the most interesting portionof the novel. It is well researched and revealing of thehistory and culture of Singapore."
__label__1,"cheap...but not in a good way.: I expected to be able to use the bow set right out the box; this was not possible since the bow was strung backwards, causing the strings to obstruct the arrow from being able to rest on the handle as you aim. Also, the finger roller and arm guard are incredibly cheaply made."
__label__1,"Didn't dare reinstall on failure: When trying to update Turbotax somehow one of the download files got corrupted and it got stuck in this endless nasty loop, where it couldn't patch and couldn't update. Every time I started I had to go through this routine. NORMALLY since I had just installed the software I'd do a clean install and be happily on my way. However, with the new copy protection scheme they are using (and IMPOSSIBLE hold times) I was too nervous to try it, because it sounded like you'd quickly be forced into purchasing 2,3,4 or even five copies if you had to reinstall.Also, whenever something doesn't work on my system I am always worried now that the copy protection is causing it. I can't wait till I can STRIP Turbotax off my computer and be back to a clean and safe system. Next year I'll be getting taxcut, and hopefully it won't be so invasive."
__label__1,"Limited Value: I find this Lammle's virtual trainer to be rather buggy. For example, the cursor often appears on the wrong line and editing keys such as delete often don't work. Now that it is possible to telnet into actual labs for $5-$10 per hour, this trainer is superfluous. Don't waste your time. Use the real thing."
__label__2,"One of the Best Books I Have Read: Excellent book that explains several different concepts found in the bible, such as Grace, Change, Repentence, Holiness, etc. Recommend it to new believers and the mature as well. Very helpful."
__label__1,"time to stop...: Anyone else getting slightly sick of the crappy Now collections. With 15, they have achieved something incredible, in being able tomake a mix with a total of three or fours decent songs. Five for fighting's ""100 years"", Norah Jones' ""sunrise"", and the now overplayed ""Falls on me"" by fuel. Everything else sucks. This compilation is full of more crap then you can pack into an hour. If you would like to waste some of your life listening to some of the worst music created since the beginning of time, then this CD should do nicely. It's not the worst now CD, but every time you here it you'll think it has to be. Do yourself a favor and stay far away."
__label__2,A Christmas Must: Harmony perfected...this CD will usher in the tender moments of Christmas you want while pushing the commercialism of the season to the background.
__label__1,"Piece of Trash: This book is horrible. It is very very very boring, Dillard may have the skills to concoct imagery, but this book does nothing but confuse the reader. Her focus changes every page, it seems like a written freestyle of thoughts. I wouldn't waste my time on this trash."
__label__1,"Not Commercial: I ordered these for my wife thinking I was getting commercial grade products. The thing that stands out the most in the accompaning booklet was the phrase""not for commercial use"". The non-stick capabilities are great but these are thin cookie sheets that sell for a couple of dollars... We have real commercial heavy cookware and this does not compare at all. We were very disappointed."
__label__2,"Better than expected: I wanted a lightweight hammock for seasonal use on my porch. This fit my needs perfectly. It is very easy to put up- I used the attached ties on the porch railing- and very sturdy. I am 5'8 about 130 lbs and I was quite comfortable. The sides of the hammock do tend to cocoon the occupant, but not in an unpleasant way. The hammock is easy to take down and folds up to nothing, it could be easily carried on a trip. I used the hammock all summer, putting it up and down several times, and it is still in great shape. Good product and very good value for the price."
__label__1,"Thorough book, but dated and lacking kana and kanji: Well, I can say that this book is extremely thorough. It will teach you how to speak Japanese fairly well, if you can wade through it. However, I personally dislike this book.This book is quite dated, as are all Jorden books. We're talking 40 years here. What's worst is the lack of kana. You won't be able to read Japanese at all. You can study kana and kanji on your own and in a class, but you'll never be very good at it unless you work yourself to death. Textbooks with kana and kanji in them, such as Nakama or the extremely good Genki are great in that you begin to be able to read Japanese nearly as fast as you can understand it, and kanji recognition is much easier."
__label__1,"OK: The Map Edit feature was great but most of the time the game would crash right in the middle of a hunt. At first it was a blast, then it was downhill from there."
__label__2,"Strong Lyrics, Great Voice: Jennifer Daniels' range and talent are evident in Summer Filled Sky, and some of her personality comes through as well. Sadly, nothing can replace the experience of hearing her live; but the CD is an acceptable substitute. Daniels moves easily from folksy ballads to energetic rock. Her voice is crystal-clear and admirably subtle. For me, though, its her lyrics that drive the music. Daniels has a gift for clever phrases and beautiful images that stick around long after the music has faded. I highly recommend the CD, and I even more strongly encourage you to hear her live."
__label__1,Carafe that did'nt work... and a return policy that doesn't help...: didn't send the right one. Needed a carafe for a DCF212T 12 pot and sent a 10 that didn't work and after reading the return policy that carafe's were not returnable I now have a useless piece.
__label__1,"Your odds are better at roulette: Sounds like this product is really hit or miss, depending on your computer. I tried to install the software on two different computers (both with operating systems supposedly supported by the software) and the software won't run on either system. I'm getting the same ''Can't find photo viewer'' error mentioned in another review. Looks like I'm just going to have to eat the cost of what I thought would be a good Father's Day present. Don't buy this product. Do your research and buy something else (unless you just feel like gambling). I wish I had!"
__label__1,"Warning: Do not buy Platano Records Edition: The Platano Records edition (2005) of Piel Sin Alma is a Macrovision ""protected"" CD that will not play in a PC or a Mac/iPod, which is how I listen to music, or even some car stereos. Raulin Rodriguez is great, but be sure to get the EMI (not Platano Records) edition this CD. -- DJ Arnoldo"
__label__1,"NOT even close to Training Day !!: Predictable, slow movie and extremely disappointing since TrainingDay was such the opposite.The ""bad guys"" were over the top. Particularly thefemale.The end was just stupid. Without being too detailed, there was arunning truck available. Why did the guy not use it ? That's only one of the many holes.Seems like they used lots of filler for little plot.The interaction between the two male leads was the only redeemingfeature of the movie, otherwise it's the same played out cops androbbers movie.Hope you enjoy it more than i did."
__label__2,"Performance Halogen Headlight Bulb: Sylvania H4651ST Silverstar High Performance Halogen Headlight Bulb are great, excellent. These replaced an older set of Sylvania Halogen headlights and they are brighter on low beam then the older set was on high beam. The light is white as advertised and the field of vision is many times greater then the average sealed beam. Highly recommend."
__label__2,Thanks!: I ordered this bench early in January being content with the projected delivery date of January 31. It actually came the very next week! What a happy surprise! It was easy to set up and easy to use. Thanks Mercantila and ecom!
__label__1,"Price and Availability: I bought the Tyco Rewinder Toy as a Christmas present for my grandson. Much to my dismay, the toy could not be used because I was unaware the rediculously priced battery pack was not available anywhere. Needless to say, the Tyco brand will not be considered in the future. There are hundeds of other customers in the Little Rock area that got sucked by this misleading sale and can probably be marked off as future customers of Tyco and Toys R Us. It turned out to be a Christmas bust.Ivan Gibbons"
__label__2,"Required Reference: The decade-by-decade images from all the books in this series are, IMHO, required references for those interested in fashion and costume design in the 20th century."
__label__2,"Tear-jerker for even the studliest among us.: Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict-- Sisters of War is based on a true story, and it's a story worth telling. I hadn't the faintest idea about what Australian nurses and nuns were up to during World War II, so a little history lesson is always appreciated. Mix that with the fact that this is a genuinely interesting human interest story--told well and executed nicely--and you've got yourself a modest gem.A TV movie originally, Sisters of War sports a top-line production design; I didn't realize it was a TV movie until looking it up on IMDb. Most of the film takes place on location and there are a handful of cinematic moments, including an intense scene featuring a bombing run. Either the filmmakers are skilled at masking a low budget or there was a nice chunk of change to work with.Which would of course mean bupkus if the story was wobbly. Not the case.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"
__label__2,"A ""must have"" for all serious judoka!: This is ""the"" classic judo book; afterall, it's written by Kano himself. The evolution of the martial art to sport judo gives the reader the true meaning of what judo is all about. There is enough here, to keep the expert learning and to keep the novice from getting bored. An absolute ""must."""
__label__1,"Please, not another Ambrose-paint by numbers book!: Drivel.Pure drivel.If one wishes the honest re-telling of history & not self-serving distortion or histrionic hyperbole, stay away from Stephen Ambrose. After reading a few of his books I crown him the Jackie Collins of historical fiction.Why one star? It's the lowest rating they offer."
__label__2,"Enjoyable and 'teachable'.: This set of delightful fairy tales will not only be enjoyed by children, but it will capture the imagination of all ages. I have taught all grade levels and have used it in literature and English classes to give excellent examples and to help generate creativity and good writing. My family has enjoyed it throughout the years and now we're giving it to yet another generation. This should be on everyone's video shelf!"
__label__2,"Guilty Pleasure - okay movie: The real reason why I wanted this film has everything to do with the ending. I know that seems weird but as a native New Yorker, I just love the scenes between a mom and her son in front of the most spectacular Christmas Tree in the world. So, there it is.The movie isn't particularly bad or good. Pretty much the same formula as the first movie with just a few more predictable changes. But I don't mind sitting through it and going along for the ride. I could do far worse."
__label__2,Wonderful: For those of us taking stock of our own lives and failures this is another wonderful work from Dr. Dyer. I am sure there are others out there that see little value in works such as these but for those who are being really honest with themselves and seeking to improve the quality of their lives and those around them Dr. Dyer is a great teacher/guide. (For the people who already have all the answers this is not for you.) I like his approach and his message(s). Dr. Dyer's work speaks loudest and clearest to those seeking to change their own life for the better. I think this work requires several viewings to get the most out of the message Dr. Dyer is trying get across. I like all of Dr. Dyer's work I have been exposed to and think this is well worth the money.
__label__2,keep them coming: Good episode. I have been a fan of the show since the first season and I am extremely pleased with the new story-line: back to where we started.
__label__2,"Very nicely made test lead set: This lead set is Fluke quality. All of the connectors fit together well. One important function of a lead set for me is to not have the connection wires be of the heavy or ""stiff"" variety, where the weight of the wire pulls on the test lead and make it difficult to make precise measurements. The extension wire (along with a couple others in the set) are made of the more pliable material which feels safer when taking measurements on small contacts."
__label__2,"replete with nuggests of spiritual wisdom: This book is made up of a number of very short chapters covering the foundational issues we all encounter in the spiritual life. Of this series of books, this would not however be my favourite - that goes to ""The wound of love""."
__label__1,"""Emotions"" is still her best cd....: I had a lot of expectations from this album, considering ""Butterfly"" was a disappointment. I figured she would put out a great album this time. I was wrong. She is trying too hard to make everyone happy. The only two tracks that are great are ""Against All Odds"" and ""Petals"". They are sure fire Number Ones. Her version of the Phil Collins song puts his to shame. But the rest of the album is a blur. And what was she thinking when she made that cover? Does she think that 99% of her fans are guys?"
__label__2,"Best Slayer album to date!: After taking a long while off from slayer, i bought christ illusion after listening to the song ""final six."" I was blown away by the opening track flesh storm, and the ride continued to get better as i got through the album. Slayer still has got it, and in my opinion they are still far superior to any new metal band that is out there. I am happy that slayer are still around, still doin what they do, and they don't pretend to be something they are not. They are always the same, and don't conform to trends. There is alot to be said for that. Some of my favorites from the album, Flesh Storm, Skeleton Christ, Jihad, Black Serenade, and Final Six. The whole album is solid though, flows from front to back. Anybody who was once into slayer needs to buy this album, it just might get you back into them!!!"
__label__2,Great book!: This was a grest heart warming book that never got boring. I would recomend it to anyone.
__label__1,"Terrible!!: I hated, hated, HATED this pump. This thing kept coming apart and I could never get it to work. I even took it apart completely and started over several times, reading the directions step by step. I still could not get it to work."
__label__2,"Very helpful: my husband and I have done a lot of work on our relationship, and were at a crucial turning point (for the worse!) when a friend suggested this book. It was incredibly helfpul and counter much of what the typical relationship books say --- don't talk about the past! Don't go into couples counseling! (I had been saying we need to go back and look at the past, we need to do couple's counseling, my husband was totally against it). It's really about connecting with your loving feelings for each other. (If you are driving down the road with your spouse and all is well, and suddenly you realize he didn't take out the trash the night before and that makes you angry, is it really a good idea to bring that up just to prove a point or do you want to reconnect with the good feelings and let that anger pass by like a cloud?) This little book is packed with simple thoughts like that which have transformed my need to be right over my husband for all of his (supposed) infractions -- not an easy task!"
__label__1,Acura TSX: This is not the right size for a ACURA TSX. It will not fit. It is longer than the OEM wiper. Other than that the wiper quality is good.
__label__2,"Built to last!: I purchased this watch in 1997 & it has been working ever since. It's gone down to 100+ feet with no problem. I have hit it, dropped it & soaked it. I lost it in a mountain biking accident inside a muddy creek bed. A few months later the creek bed dried up & I saw it. I picked it up & it was still ticking. It had no oxidation, no rust and no damage. Wenger makes a great watch."
__label__2,good book but beginners beware: This is a nice book for those of us who are familiar with Dreamweaver and web application development in general. Beginners may have a difficult time. The projects are decent and the code available for download is complete.
__label__2,"Surprise a christian rock band that is awsome: I love the posative views that they have to express, and I love that they do it in an angry way. Check these guys out.....Southtown is a TREMENDOUS song."
__label__2,"winesaver: Works not only on wine bottles, but on the containers. Use it every day on coffee canisters and soya bean canisters, etc. Do not have to hose up with the foodsaver. Much easier to use. Need the machine only when you want to bag something."
__label__2,"I seldom rate a movie so high: This was a sleeper hit in my opinion. I discovered this movie by accident and just fell in love with it. It is a brillant masterful work of modern cinema art. A cross between the Matrix, 1984, and DarkCity this is one great movie. It deals with a cold, emotionless, nazi like future society where emotion is outlawed and regulated by medication. Sense Offenders are hunted down and killed along with horded art, music, and other precious antiques. In one scene they burn the a very well known painting after confirming that it was the real deal. A somewhat depressing movie at first grows into an exciting fun to watch drama. The Gun Kata is something new and unique, executed in a brillant and fun to watch manor. This movie bumped Empire Strikes Back off of my top 5 list. That is how much I enjoyed this movie."
__label__1,"WHY ME?: I could had brought something more constructive wit my $15.00. This cd dissapointed me. I fell to sleep after track #3. But tracks 13,14,15,and 16 are tight. That is one-third of an album,I should had paid $5.00 for it."
__label__2,Inspiring!: I can't wait to go backpacking so I can try out some of the tasty sounding recipes! Very easy to read and packed with great backpacking tips!
__label__1,"Not the Sam I heard: I never heard of Sam Brown until I saw her on ""Concert for George,"" headed up by Eric Clapton. Sam sang a killer song, ""You can lead a horse to water..."". I loved it. So I ordered this album. I wanted more of what I heard in that concert, and sad to say, this wasn't it. I still think she has a terrific voice, but I didn't care for the songs or the arrangements in this album."
__label__2,"Great book!: A wonderful book, providing both Spanish and English versions of the poems side-by-side, which is excellent for my Spanish studies. It arrived with a sticker on the spine that is the type to leave white residue, however the rest of the book is in perfect condition."
__label__2,"Cite Right A Quick Guide to Citation Styles: BooksThis helpful book came at the right time, and in great condition for the price. I will be using it the rest of this semester and next!Thank-you for doing business with me.Tonya R. Shipley"
__label__2,"Great parka: Exactly as described, very light, but warm parka. It's big, so you'll have to order at least one size smaller you normally wear. The only issue is that buttons are poorly stitched and fell off by the end of the first day. I restitched them all, so all good now. Not a big deal, otherwise it's a great product."
__label__2,"Warm analog tones: While this may have sounded a little corny when it was recorded, time has been good to this album (from 1975). It doesn't sound at all kitschey. It's amazing how much electronic music owes to Kraftwerk; there probably are no records that sound anything like it prior to 1975. I have always found this album hypnotic, and expressing a love for the modern world that's hard to put into words (since they use so few). A must have for any fan of electronic music."
__label__2,"A beautifully written book that I would recommend to anyone!: I thought that this book was very well written. Itputs beautiful pictures of each word in your mind, andit seems to flow well. It started off by bringing you intothe story early on, but unlike other books, you cannot identify the point in which you get into thebook, it just gently pulls you into the story without younoticing. At some times, the book lacks energy and excitement,but at other times, the wording and description ofthe scenes and characters almost enchants you.It is definitely a classic, and although it is not about love,a good word to describe it is romantic. I recommend this bookto anyone!!!!!!-Katie Manning, American School In Japan, 6th grade."
__label__1,PRAISE FOR THE EAGLE HEIST & RAYMOND AUSTIN: Austin has combined a terrific story with excellent characters for a marvelous read. This is his first book in the Beauford Sloan series. I really look forward to the next.
__label__2,"1st PMP and lovin it!: I got my 604 30GB wifi as a gift from my boyfriend and now he wants one. and about two months ago and I'm really enjoying it. The screen resolution is great and the functions are fairly easy to use. I got the DVR station too and it was easy to set up. I love that you can record off your tv. You can browse and transfer files from one place to another i.e. computer, another Archos, or mp3 player.There are a few gripes though. The battery life is only about 3-4hours long when watching a movie file. There is no keyword search feature (unlike the Creative Zen W Vision that my boyfriend has)only a browser and with 30GB of hard drive space to fill looking for songs takes a little longer. Some of the instructions aren't very clear.All in all I thinks it's a best buy!"
__label__2,"Take What You Need: I followed the principles in this book and found that they do work. I didn't follow every single recipe, neither did I clean my sock drawer on the day she suggested I do so. What I did was make a list of the things I like to eat and incorporate them into the principles of the plan. The spa on a budget tips and organizational tips were just a bonus, you could take them or leave them. As a result I lost over 20 pounds in 30 days. As with any lifestyle change, everything doesn't work for everybody so I would say to you, take what you need. If you can rent the book from the library or buy it at a reduced price I would suggest you do that. If you find that it didn't work for you then pass it on to someone else who may benefit."
__label__1,"doesn't take off: A surprisingly conservative comedy in which Helen (Kate Hudson), a Carrie Bradshaw-lite who works at a modeling agency, inherits the kids of her late sister (Felicity Huffman). Helen and the kids move to Queens, and of course she can't keep up her jet set lifestyle...A number of domestic problems crop up, but they're all handled with smiles, hugs, and life lessons. A more interesting subplot involves Helen's relationship with her other sister (Joan Cusack), a full time Mom kwho doesn't emotionally connect with Helen. Cusack has to walk a tightrope of being funny and bitter, and she does it well. Helen (Hudson attacks the role with all of her appealing energy) is given a chance to resume her career, but things just aren't the same without the kids. This is a troubling film, clearly suggesting to women that there's something wrong with wanting to have it all...Also with John Corbett, Helen Mirren, Hayden Pantierre, Spencer and Abigail Breslin, and Paris Hilton....."

After that it started making an internal repetitive sound wasn't sure if it way the adapter or the stereo. Bought a cassette cleaner and tried a couple other tapes after that, it wasn't the stereo, it was the adapter. Still works, but makes an annoying sound that unless you have the volume up fairly high you can hear over the music. Like I said in the title for the review, ""you get what you pay for"""

__label__1,"There's something to be said for previews....: ...especially when most childrens videos are well made and clever. But Clifford, a favorite in books, doesn't translate to the screen very well. Especially when the huge dog adopts human porportions. His head looks ok, but his body is long and skinny, just like the actor playing him. He sings a variety of childrens songs, circa 1950, like ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"", and ""Bingo"". The happy family is retro 70's, complete with bad hair and clothes. Considering the price, the makers of this video could at least upgrade the looks of Clifford and the people around him. My granddaughter was so excited about this video, but has only watched it once. Wonder why?"

I plugged it in and when I went back to check on it I discovered that it was sitting in a puddle of water. The display window was clouded with moisture, too. I disconnected it and let it sit for a couple of hours. I checked it again and this time it wasn't wet any longer, but I noticed that the beads in the display window had turned white. I have no idea what is going on with this item, but I'm reporting it as BROKEN! This is a significant loss as it is too late to return it. Very disappointing."

__label__2,"Review: Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge: After reading other reviews, I decided to grab this carpet cleaner for the excellent price and the number of positive reviews.I'm completely satisfied with the purchase. This Hoover was simple to set up, didn't leak and did a great job for the cost. The suction when removing water from the carpet is excellent. After just a couple of pass overs on each area, the drying time was just a few hours which allowed me to move the furniture back into place and get to the next area quickly. I was amazed to be able to accomplish so much in a such a short time.I always dreaded calling a service in or renting a machine. Now I can tackle the carpets anytime - even for quick clean ups.I definitely recommend this carpet cleaner and would buy it again. Very satisfied."

__label__1,"Don't Use this with Linksys Router: I bought this ethernet adaptor for my laptop to connect to a Linksys cable/dsl router (BEFSR41). The main reason was that this adaptor is a bit cheaper and comes with a CAT-5 cable.I installed it per instructions, even went on the net to get the latest driver (which turned out to be same as one that came with it in the box) but it just sat there, no network, no connection to the internet. After many hours messing around with it, I did get it to connect to the internet once (loaded one page) then nothing.I called tech support but after waiting an hour without being able to talk to a real person, I decided to give up. I returned the unit the next day, picked up a Linksys adaptor. With the Linksys adaptor, it took exactly 5 minutes to get my laptop connected and working perfectly. The moral of the story is to stick to one brand of networking devices."

I was worried that they'd be so hard that I wouldn't be able to finish a full workout for a while (like his bootcamp videos are).

__label__2,If you can afford only one book: If you can afford to buy only one book to help you write your memoir then buy Your Life as Story by Tristine Rainer. She has broken down the creative process of writing a memoir into do-able steps. Follow them and you will create a book. The only thing that I didn't like was her frequent use of vulgarity. It was something that I needed to filter to get to the good stuff she was teaching.
__label__1,"Biggest Piece of JUNK I've Ever Owned: What a piece of complete GARBAGE this unit is. Constantly stops recording in the middle of programs and tape transfers; record part of a program, pause it and try to finish it later and the unit won't recognize the disc; constant disc failure; it's just completely unreliable. I wouldn't buy another one of these if it only cost a penny. I probably spent more money on blank DVDs that were ruined by this machine than the unit itself cost."

__label__1,Didn't work!: The Linksys wireless adapter was fairly easy to install (it took longer to open the computer) but installing the software was a pain. The software is not user friendly and seemed pretty unprofessional. It had little in the area of help or troubleshooting and not even my father who is a computer programmer could figure it out. It didn't work at all in the end and I will find another brand of adapter instead of getting a replacement.

__label__1,"Double-dipping is an insult to fans!: I agree with several others here who chastised Universal for double-dipping with ""It Ain't Hay"" on this release. It's a slap in the face for all the fans who bought all the previous releases, as I have. I'm not spending over $80 for one film. All this does is make Universal (and all the other studios that do this, Paramount and Warner included) look very bad, and confirms my decision to stop giving these arrogant companies my money by not ""upgrading"" my entire DVD collection to Blu-Ray and buy a good upconverting 1080p DVD player instead."
__label__2,"Encouraged me to pursue changes in my life: I read this book yesterday after a friend recommended it. The theme of dealing with change is well defined and inspirational. If nothing else, Johnson prods his readers to pursue the changes that need to take place. After all, perservering in an uphill battle is difficult, but maintaining the energy to continue the changes until you become content again is harder. I'm encouraged to keep reading and suggesting this book to others who will appreciate it."

I would instead recommend, tool, or apc. I'll probably forget about this album soon."
__label__2,"A good 'beach book' on the beach: Lencek and Bosker describe themselves as specialists in popular culture and that they are. Their book on the history of the beach should be properly be described as history lite.The central theme of the work is what people have and are doing on it and in it, what do they wear to the beach and not wear to it, etc. In short this is a social history of the beach with only passing references to its many other aspects such as geology, economics, politics, history, ecology, etc.The book also looks at the beach at length only in the U.S., the U.K. and on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. The social history of the beach in the rest of the world, were in fact most beaches are located, is never discussed other than in passing.For those going to the beach with time to spend reading this is a fine book. For those looking for serious history you may wish to look elsewere."

__label__1,"Dull and Lifeless: I can't believe anyone would dare to compare this with the WWI books by Pat Barker. This had absolutely none of the emotional charge those books have. Nor did the people in it seem to have been affected by the war. I never felt anything for any of the characters, including the main character Ian Rutledge. The pace of the book was glacial. The women characters were interchangeable and straight out of a romance novel. I finished the book just to see ""who dunnit,"" and that was certainly a disappointment. I plan to skip any sequels."

I don't usually enjoy contemporaries as much as historicals, but this one held my attention so much so that I read it in one sitting. The Montgomery/Taggert family bond helped to bind this story in a way that makes you glad that there are families that are still as close as this one. Not only that, but I love it when an adventure like this one can keep me on my toes. I felt as if I were the one being chased! Excellent job as always Ms. Deveraux, but I'm still hoping for a historical next year!"

It goes into great detail explaining anything and everything that you could think of in the Wheel of Time universe. I definately recommend this book if you are a fan of Robert Jordan's extremely popular books. It tells you the past of all the forsaken, and goes into great detail about all of the major and minor lords/ladies and lands in which they control. Definately a must for any WoT fan!"
__label__1,"More a Textbook Than a Novel: This book fell far short of the standards I had for it. The narrative jumped not just between characters, but also between planets and time periods. There's very little adventure or excitement and what really enraged me was that a character description in the book lied about one professional who is enraged and plots to make the protagonist pay for ruining his life's dream to study the Martian volcanoes, but yet he does nothing! He fumes and is enraged, but that is it!Parts of the book seemed too much like a textbook for my taste, and even got redundant with the author constantly reminding the reader that Mars' sky is not blue.Add it all together with stereotypical cardboard characters and it makes for a most dissatisfying read, not as bad as Allen Steele's Coyote Trilogy though."

The toy looks attractive at first glance, with a joystick, five playing modes, and several countries and cultures to explore and learn about. Unfortunately, the joystick is awful and hard to use even for an adult, let alone a small child, and the content is very limited, providing little replay value once a child has played through the five modes, which takes no time. The toy also feels flimsy. There's so much VTech could done to make it a worthy toy, but once again, they seem more interested in getting your money than providing a useful toy for kids."

This movie took them 12 years and $25 million to make. It only made $10 million at the box office. The characters were incredibly boring and irritating. The animation looked like some cheap 1979s cartoon. It took me three days to watch all of it. Let me tell you, even that was a chore. Most of the negative reviewers are fans of the books. I have never read the books but am I big fan of Disney. This movie was a true disappointment to me. Skip it, if the urge every comes to you to watch it."

Tory returns to her home town to open a store in the area hoping to bring closure to the murder for herself. She becomes involved with Hope's older brother, Cade, and Hope's twin sister, Faith.

I don't need to read a book to get that attitude; I can just talk to my relatives!The one helpful part of the book was the case studies of how different women handled different work situations especially unusual situation.

There is no sense of coherent progression of concepts and the authors frequently include extraneous information which is distracting. The approach attempts to break down the various aspects of Schenkerian Analysis by separately discussing bass lines, melodic structures, formal design, etc. but it is very unclear as to the relationships of the various aspects and is inconsistent in it's own use of the analytical language. The sequencing of the text makes it difficult to glean a holistic understanding of the method. In a graduate course I took recently, the professor spent large portions of class just answering questions about places we were confused by the text.

I mean, the original Sonic games were great, but this one tops them all.What's neat is, you don't have to be sonic the whole game. Knuckles, Amy, and Tails are now playable. That's what got it one of the five stars.Like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2, you can take care of Chao in Chao gardens. This gives you something to do if you are stuck in adventure mode. There's the second star.All you need is a link cable and some friends with a GBA to play some multiplayer. You're friends don't have to have Sonic Advance to play with you. Yep, the third star.Sonic Advance gets it's fourth star because it can hook up to the Nintendo Gamecube game Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and trade Chao data and Chao themselvs.The last star is for all-out game play. It's another running, jumping, spining, dashing, rolling, gliding, flying, hitting, smashing Sonic Game. How could you not like it???"

__label__2,"For the price, i don't think there are better mic's out there: these mic's are an incredible buy, the condensers are quite clear and with the 10db pad built in you don't have to worry about overloading your interface. The snare mic is a little weak and I only ever have a problem with it when im recording a very loud snare and a drumer who likes to make some rimshots, the tom mics are great, the only thing i did not like about this was the kick mic, but with a good preamp, no not the gain knob on your interface, you can easily fix that and make it sound good, also if the kick mic goes inside the drum, like in a porthole, it will sound a million times better, you honestly can't mic a kickdrum without a hole, or taking the resonator head off. Even with the kick mic, buy these they're totally worth it, and if you break one your not out the price of a nice mic that you wanted to ""experiment"" with."

This book consistently failed on that account.

This book fails on this account too. Try looking at the Greens book or Ron Picarski's books."

The fast songs tend to be kind of electronic sounding, with strong beats and catchy hooks. The slow songs all sound like love ballads, but all the songs are good. If you are a fan of Brandy, or if you aren't, this CD is different from her others so check it out!"
__label__2,"Really fun but too short!: I just did this workout today for the first time. What a fun workout! My biggest complaint is that it's too short. I definitely could have kept going.Kelsie is very motivating and she's good at cueing. She did kind of annoy me by saying ""I need you to do this..."" over and over. But it wasn't too bad. The camera work is kind of off a couple of times...focusing on the beginner moves while Kelsie is doing the advanced moves, very obvious transitions, etc. I suggest that you keep moving after each segment because there's a good 4-5 second pause between each one.The kickboxing segments are really fun. Again, I wish there were more. I used 10 pound weights for the weight training segments and that was quite a challenge. I really liked the ab segement as well, and I'm not always a huge fan of those. I highly recommend this workout. I know it's going to become a regular in my rotation!"

We haven't gotten into looking at constellations yet, but it comes with a little star guide. I think it is fitting for a girl or a boy. Wonderful product."

The Little Bear movies we've seen so far have been the most pure that I've found so far. Little Bear and his friends talk nicely to each other and encourage creative play. Thankfully, my 4.5-year-old really enjoys them. He comes home from pre-school talking about power rangers and bad guys and joker man and Mr. Freeze(which he's never seen....how do these 4/5-year-old boys know about such stuff such that they model this play on the playground?), yet he loves to watch Little Bear. The simplicity is endearing and when I watch him actually smiling for almost the entire episode, my heart is glad."

__label__1,"This ""Carpenter"" entry needs fixing!: ""Sudden Death"" is the second Andy Carpenter book that I've read(I was introduced to the series last year when I read 'Bury the Lead'). As with the previou book, the charaters are inteesting, well-developed and quirky without being too annoying.The plot is the biggest problem with 'Sudden Death'. There's a lot of build-up, but very little payoff. This won't stop me from reading other entries in this series, but Rosenfelt needs to tweak things a bit. Some of the similarities to Robert B. Parker and the 'Spenser' cast are rather obvious here. Maybe Rosenfelt needs to work on finding his own 'voice' and motivation for these characters, rather than simply emulating what others have done before."
__label__2,"Nukleopatra always keeps me smiling: Dead or Alive's US release of Nukleopatra brings a huge smile to my face and gets the feet dancing. All of these songs are an example of what Pete Burns and Steve Coy do best: making music that is FUN. Absolutly, one of their best albums."
__label__1,"A very poor novel: The first couple of pages of 'The Power' are intriguing and promise to develop into a gripping thriller. However, after that it is downhill all the way. This is possibly one of the worst books that I have ever read. The characters are paper thin, and completely unbelievable. The dialogue is mundane and pedestrian. The development of the plot is juvenile, it reminds me of the universal baddies such as Smersh from the Man from U.N.C.L.E. The 'stage whisper' comments from the characters explaining the significance of particular plot developments are insulting to the readers intelligence.For a far more credible, readable and enjoyable thriller read Stephen Leather."

That's when Erasure's ""STOP!"" kicks in, a raucous song that will have you up and on your toes.I tuned in and out of this movie when it was on HBO, it never really held my attention. Sure there were some cute actors and actresses who were stripping down now and then but the whole movie was just bizarre. I kept watching though because I was bored. Finally this piece of junk ended and my favorite band started singing.Instead of buying this, just go buy any one of Erasure's great albums instead. More bang for your buck."

One very helpful feature is that it tells the factory specified part numbers for spark plugs, lower unit oil, etc. The only improvement that I would suggest is that it be more specific in the models covered, and not so many different engines be covered in one manual."

Be warned though that although these flavors do mix in water alone they taste much better in milk or soymilk. There is a strong funny aftertaste when water is the base."
__label__2,This will be a great DVD for any Tom Green fan!!: It's an all out HILARIOUS movie! Tom Green plays Gord Brody who is a bum that lives in his Parent's basement and dreams of being an Animator. Although it doesn't have a great plot I still think it was great. I saw it in the theaters and it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. My face hurt from laughing so much when it was over. If you like Tom Green you will enjoy this movie as much as I did. For anyone that doesn't like gross out comedy or you're like a certain reviewer who only gives good reviews to little princess stories this isn't for you. This DVD hopefully will include any deleted senes and also commentary. I hope you enjoy the movie:)

I am so disappointed, since I had once thought of Bushnell as a quality brand. Close inspection (now that they're in multiple pieces) allows me to see just how poorly and cheaply constructed these binoculars really are. I could never recommend Bushnell again. I am going to try to get a replacement set since I bought them directly from ecom. Either way, I'll not spend any more money on Bushnell."
__label__2,"You missed the point if you think this is religious: I find this book invaluable. Like others who have already posted, I am not religious. But I can accept that God, as was written in the book, equates to 'Good Orderly Progress'. I DO have an investment in making progress in my life and this book has given me the tools to do so. It's not about any religion, other than what you find within you, or anyone externally fixing your life. It's about learning what you can do for yourself. There are diverse references presented to many world religions, but I found these to be helpful in supporting the points made in the book, not detracting from it."
__label__2,"What is this Feeling? LOVING: There have been a lot of different feelings on this book. One of the first pages is a note from the composer Stephen Schwartz, giving a discription of why some of the songs are altered a bit. He goes on to give his e-mail address if you need further assistance (very cool).Now Of course any songs taken away from a full orchestra, to perform on your own or with a small group, are going to need some changes. My skills at reading and playing music are limited and this is deffinately not an EZ play book but it's great just the same, and knowing Stephen Schwartz himself worked on it and not some schmo from who-knows-where makes it worth it."

__label__1,"Junk... Very disappointed: We are very disappointed with this product. It arrived with two brass plates taped to the front which were not pictured on the product page. One of these plates was cut incorrectly so one side didn't match the other. There also isn't enough room for a proper tail mount. The bracket in the back doesn't fit over the tail and if you use it you need longer screws than what was provided and it still won't hang correctly. We have done several tail mounts and this kit was by far the worst product we have ever used. The packaging was also terrible, the hardware was packaged on top of the mount which scratched and dug into the mount. If I hadn't purchased this with my ecom points and if I had noticed that you can't actually hang this mount up or even mount the tail feathers before I had fixed all of the defects I would return it... Absolute junk, don't waste your money, time, or energy. I would give this product 0 stars if that was possible."

__label__1,"The Ipaq 1935 CAN fit in this case!: The aluminum is bendable, so you can squeeze the inside end clips in, to fit the IPAQ 1935. This worked very nicely.There is an inch or at the top that you don't need, but I still use this case, and find it adequate to protect the PDA. There is no other hard case which opens from the top, allows the USB/Charger plug to fit in the PDA while it is in the case, and allows the headphone to be plugged in. So.... I decided to keep the case .... until something better comes along."

The film tries to get to the ""heart"" of what music is and how it affects us on so many levels. While not a fast paced film, it still manages to grab and hold the viewers attention because the subject matter is so intriguing- How does one describe ""music""? It brings forth both a visceral and physical response and the many interviewees are funny, thoughtful and insightful. If you are a musician or just love music than give this film a viewing!"

Since it was not sold directly by ecom, the return is not as smooth already as I would have liked. I'm hoping to hear back soon from the seller.

__label__1,"Best Book Ever? Kidding?: First of all, political pundits can rarely produce good writing. It is their ideas people find enticing, so just admit it that this book is poorly written and you just like Hannity's ideas. Second, why are opinion books so popular? Form your own opinions. Conservatives that need to buy books by Hannity and Coulter are intellectually dependent on pundits to affirm their own values. If you're one of those people that read newspapers, forms an opinion on an issue, then turns on Hannity-Radio to make sure that his opinions jive with yours (and then change your own opinion because Hannity has a different one)...then you should buy this book. If you read a newspaper and form your own opinions without needing someone to tell you that your ideas are A-OK, then don't buy this book."

His accounts of battles is at times pretty accurate, but I think he wandered off in some of his political punditry. I don't believe Mr. Toland did his best work here. Fehrenbach's This Kind of War, is far superior, both in style and content. I never heard anything but sarcasm from the grunt level when Higgins was mentioned. Some of her interviews with the troops were ludicrous. Toland spends more time and effort on her than it's worth."

So I had to return this one back and purchased another Linksys E1000, which worked immediately after very-easy installation. The only one star is to give ecom's excellent service, and ZERO star should rate this product. So, highly NOT recommend this product to anyone who would like to have a home wireless network. Keep away from this junk and save your money and time."

__label__1,"Mindless and Dull: Despite the susposedly titanic failure of Morrowind... I have to give Neverfun Nights a horrible review. Simply put, this game is mindless and dull. I find myself talking to NPCs and wishing that I could just get on with it and do some fighting. Then I do some fighting and I wish that I could talk to some NPCs. Furthuremore, if I'm buying equipment, I find that I wish I was doing either of the above unpleasant actions. The problem is that the game is TOTALLY linear with uninventive environments and scenarios. The only reason I gave this game more than one star is that on occasion when I am feeling particularly tired, the game can be a little addictive. Sort of like Diablo 2..."
__label__2,"Keyboard review: Set up easy. Mouse takes some getting use to, but was a good buy. Would recommend this product and seller."
__label__1,"Questions for others: I have a couple of concerns about this book. As a mom who has lost a child to adoption, I am familiar with the ""writing a letter to your child"" right after placement and filling up the pages with words of hope. However, often times, this is not the full scope of the reality of what has happened to the mom, and it is a once done thing, and is frozen in time. It doesn't seem to go into depth of the sense of loss that these women will feel later, how they will be affected negatively by the loss of their child, despite their greatest hopes forced into making this decision through lack of any real options by profit making agencies.I would love to read a book that is about mothers who've lost children in other countries twenty years after placement (or so) to talk about their experience and how it affected them for the rest of their life."
__label__1,"Poorly researched, intellectually biased: Study the early church fathers with an open mind and you'll be pleasantly surprised, all you anti-Catholic Catholics (and others).

__label__1,CD Changer: I had to return this item twice. Both times because the changer would not work. The first one would not even open. It top of the unit appeared to be bent. The second would open but the carousel would not turn. I don't think this unit can stand up to being shipped.
__label__1,Completly awfull.: What an agonnzing film. THis could have been a good film but Paltrows one note preformance does the film in. She is a terriable actress who showed little talent here and even less( And this is possialbe the worst preofrmance i have ever seen) in her oscar winning one. the rest of the cast is good but she is just awfull. Platrow should sotp embarrsingother young actress whit what she calls acting.

__label__2,"Better than Ozzie!: Though not enough of the actual racing makes the cut, the reality of family life comes through! As a Dad with two daughters (we're not in the racing business!) I can relate to the story line. They are an American icon family. and it's great to see that they have been documented on film. Better than your average flick. I would highly recommend seeing them race in person, and recommend this DVD to those who have seen them in action. A great look into a real family, as harsh as it may seem. Go Force Racing!"
__label__2,"Very inspirational, Highly recommend: This book is one of the most amazing faith filled stories I have read in a long time.What Mel and Brian Birdwell went through after the tragedy of 9/11 and how it made them grow in the Chrisitan faith never giving in to others negativity is a true testimony of how God does work miracles. Brian Birdwell is a walking miracle.This was the best of all the books I have read about people who have survived 9/11. This is one book once you read it, you will never forget it!"
__label__2,"Great Album to listen to and dance to! He is Terrific!!: I've listened to LaFave for a long time, and have seen him perform in Dallas Texas, every time he is in town. His singing truely touches my soul personally, and for that I Love him. My kids know every single song he sings, and everyone knows he is my favorite artist, He has a great band too, and those guys are truely talented!! I Wish them all continued success, Because if any one deserves to be recognized its for sure Jimmy and his Band!"
__label__2,"The funniest game you'll ever play: This game is endlessly amusing and super easy for almost everyone to play. All the details are super delightful, from aquiring 'young 'ens' to getting a 'rig' and getting married (and divorced and remarried) the options are endless, you'll never have the same journey twice. The game even offers suggestions on different ways to play and an expansion pack which offers even more options. By far the best game I've purchased, I reccomend it to anyone who wants a laughter filled, light hearted evening."
__label__1,"Horrible cast--don't waste your money: I accidentally purchased this copy, thinking that I was getting the original cast recording. It was horrible--mainly because the actors/actresses were absolutely horrendous. The cast for this recording was SO weak, especially the main characters of Chris and Kim.I saw this show 7x on Broadway, and despite the fact that I never saw Lea Salonga, I still thought that the various casts were very good. How did they decide to choose this one to record, especially the main characters.Please don't buy this---I am about to throw mine away."
__label__1,"This is some comical parpdy spoof -- NOT Sherlock Holmes: I know this is a little late, but tonight for movie night we rented the 2nd Sherlock Holmes movie that so many people raved about.Ouch ... this was painfulAll 6 people at my home yelled out .. ""GONG"" about 30 minutes into it.Wonderful sets and wardrobe ......... but it was like slapstick humor.Too goofy, like a parody.We were waiting for Jerry Lewis and the 3 Stooges to jump out at anytime.It was NOT Sherlock Holmes, it was some comedy spoof.It seemed to be nothing but an endless romp of fight scenes done in s silly comical way.The whole group of us voted to eject it and stop watching it."

__label__2,"another industrial-metal hellsphere from A. Grossman & Co.: The third release from the man who brought you 1992's industrial-metal masterpiece, ""Burning In Water, Drowning In Flame"", this album is a must for the fans. The guitar is a bit overdosed this time around, but it has some of the coolest backing electronics I have ever heard (ex. the electro back build in ""Black Eye""). The vocals are also much less distorted than on previous releases, but lyrically just as twisted, and the drums just thunder and devastate. Basically, a good apocalyptic onslaught of brutal electro-metal. If you're into Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM, Chainsaws.And.Children, Rammstein, Static-X, etc etc...this is a definite record to invest in."
__label__2,"FF9p First and best review: I can say buy it now or you wil regret for the rest of your life. If you haven't heard any FF song, this`s a good start. This CD contain most kind of music, from classical music to death metal( or at least-hard rock). The end. Review:really short and really compact."
__label__1,"Nonstick wore off in one year: The pan worked well for one year. Now just about everything sticks, even though I coat the pan with oil. I have always followed all of the pan's instructions, including only using rubber utensils. Now I am going to buy a Swiss Diamond 12.5 inch pan, because they actually remain nonstick for life."
__label__2,"Great ""Step-up or Step-down"" Digital Camera: I have a Canon EOS Rebel SLR Digital Camera with all the quality and flexibility that this sort of camera entails...but for being able to take family pictures w/o sacrificing all manual control, the 4200 is it. The price, 4MP, auto redeye reduction, optical zoom, light-weight and small size make it the handiest pocket camera (that can still give you nice picture quality) I have even seen. One word of advice, as with any digital camera, you need a FAST memory card like the Sandisk Ultra II, if you don't want to w**a**i**t between shots."
__label__2,"Great Customer Service!!: They had a great price for these and quick shipping. I just didn't like the smell of the them when they came out of the box. Reminded me of walking through Harbor Freight when I was younger, ICK~! Otherwise, they were great and will be put up with a smile in the Spring."
__label__2,"Kim's Euro Synth Masterpiece!: I liked the production and songwriting and musicians on this album. The melodies and Kim's performance are strong. And I agree that Kim was ahead of her time. The jazzy, aerobic ""You Make My Heart Beat Faster"" starts the CD off on a high energy note. (To the other NYC poster, WHAT CLUBS IN NYC PLAYED THIS? - - I don't ever remember hearing it except in my boyfriend's loft). I recommend this one strongly.....along with her others."
__label__1,Dakshina: Another disappointing CD. Deva Premal had one great great CD and that was THE ESSENCE. She needs to recapture the spirit of spirituality again in her next CD as she really has lost it in her two recent CDs.
__label__2,"Treasure found: One person's junk is another person's treasure! I can't help but wonder why the self-named ""music fan from USA"" bought this combined 2-album set (1963 and 1965 original issue dates) without having at least some knowledge of how the young Wayne Newton sounded in those early years. It was that unique sound that made him the star he was then and is still today! I was thrilled to find this cd. I have been searching other Newton releases for one song, ""Laura Lee"" and until now have been disappointed. With this cd I have struck gold. Songs 13 through 23 were from the album ""Red Roses for a Blue Lady"" which I wore out through repeated playings in the late 60's and early 70's. Great listening for Wayne Newton fans!"
__label__2,"A garage-revival masterpiece: ""Sound of Confusion"" offers all that every (neo)psychedelia and garage revival wants to hear: hypnotic tracks full of fuzzy one-or-two-chord guitars and a repetitive rhythm section that creates and stratospheric experience into the listener head.Highly influenced by The Stooges and The 13th Floor Elevators (this album includes Little Doll and Rollercoaster), Spacemen 3's debut album is, I'm sure, a lesson of crazy music."
__label__2,"When is it Coming?: I don't know what it takes to get a show on DVD, but I can't wait for My Three Sons. I especially like the black and white episodes with Mike and Robbie, Chip and Bub. Like the other reviewers I never would have seen them if it wasn't for Nick at Nite. I've never seen them anywhere else again. Fortunately I taped most of them. But getting them on DVD would be better. I would want all 12 seasons!!!"
__label__1,"Keep your money: I used to buy these shoes at some dollar store across the street from my house and reading these reviews, it is obvious that the quality on these ones are no better than the ones that I used to see. I would never pay more than $10 for these things unless there is a better quality version out there."
__label__1,"Mediocre at best: After playing this game, I was left with the feeling that they are running out of ideas. The fact that you are forced to control two characters is innovative, and at the same time detracts from the Resident Evil experience, because you are no longer alone, which is part of what made previous titles in the series so scary. All around it's just an uncreative game. They attempted to make up for lack of good puzzles by throwing tons of enemies at you, which you of course don't have enough ammo to kill them all, so you're going to take a lot of damage. Rent this one at the most."
__label__1,"Cheap!!!!: The unit sprays to low on the windshield. You can only tighten the nut once, when trying to reposition the unit the nut stripped out the second time when tightening.Although the unit wasn't that expensive it time consuming installing it. The companion should make sure little things like it hitting the windshield at a good location is a must."
__label__1,"A lot of dead bugs...the rest flew the coupe: The ladybugs were shipped in a timely manner. I followed the directions provided on how and when to release the ladybugs. First, half the ladybugs in the bag were dead. The rest began eating the aphids (I have a lot) the first night and were eating the next morning. When I got home that afternoon and checked on them they were all gone or dead. I feel like I wasted my money. Guess I will go buy pesticide."
__label__2,"Awesome but for everyday use doesnt last long: I love wellgate products, I also use their ankle supports because I have very weak ankles from 12 years of tennis. But back to the wrist brace, I have tendonitis from over use and my doctor told me to use a brace while I sleep so that I don't hurt it while sleeping. This brace works great but when using everyday, it probably only lasts 2-3 months before the part where the velcro sticks to right at the wrist gets deformed and doesnt grip well. The bottom velcro part seems to last forever but the top part doesnt and you cant just replace the top one you need to buy a whole new one. So at $18 a pop it seems a but expensive but it does work well."
__label__1,"Very bad!: This sound track is horrible. The same repetitive theme over and over again. I want to hear music, but Horner uses over the top, special affects instead of musical creativity, so that the listener will think that it's so new, dramatic, meaningful. Are you kidding me? Music for the dumb! The sound track is as bad as the soap opera, weakly developed movie. I will give this CD away to a friend who loves the film!"
__label__2,"Great harness: The great thing about this harness is that there are multiple points that you can clip your leash to change the function of the harness. There is the traditional back clip which is great for a well behaved walker, but there is also an area on the front of the chest that you can clip your leash to to make it a more ""easy walk"" like harness, helps the dog to learn not to pull on the leash"
__label__1,"Curriculum and Methodology VERY outdated: I was forced to teach high school Japanese using this textbook for seven years. Both I and my students were unimpressed with the heavy emphasis on its audiolingual methodology. I had to supplement with my own materials for culture and kana/kanji writing. The entire book centers around grammar, not useful Japanese. The current ACTFL proficiency guidelines and National Foreign Language standards now stress task-based curricula used with a more modern teaching methodology that incorporates real-life situations and materials. The book does contain some weird Japanese that is only there to fit the grammar point. The videos are old and the sound quality is bad. If you want good, current Japanese that also includes culture (NONE in the Jorden method!) notes, go with anything put out by the publishers of the Nihongo Journal (ALC Press). No textbook these days is entirely in roomaji either. I gave this book one star for its usefulness as a grammar guide."
__label__2,"The book is great; buy it. Buy them all.: Fifteen years ago my life was changed by this man. He is my unmet mentor, my nongenetic grand-father, a kinsman of deeper connective tissue at the furthest cosmic reaches. From him came my dire hatred of hypocrisy in myself, but my compassion for the hypocrisy in individuals. From him came my protective shell of pessimism with the soft, mushy center. From him came my higgledy-piggledy recursiveness, essence-saving perseverence and cynical sensitivity. Or maybe he just made it seem possible and okay to be those things ... ? Whatever the case, I'm more than grateful -- I'm, unashamedly and doggedly, me. Otherwise I can't begin to measure my gratitude; there are no modifiers of quality which could sufficiently express the depth of thanks I owe. God bless his lovely soul."
__label__1,"Worst movie I've seen in the past year: A lot of bad movies have been released over hyped and over rated-but this is easily the worst of them. The story never really goes anywhere, which might work in a comedy--but this isn't a comedy. A great actor (McGregor) and a good actress (Judd) wasted in a horrible story. Alan Smithee could have done it better!!! Maybe it would have been better in Japanese, as I didn't understand it anyway. I watched this movie with my wife and my mother-and none of us could believe how bad it was. My daughter and her husband watched it later and felt the same. Five for five in the thumbs down department, and we all love watching movies!"
__label__1,"sorry spoof: I was disappointed with this movie. To be fair, I don't like spoof movies, especially when the originals are already funny enough. This is a spoof of blaxploitation movies from the 70s. If you want to see the real thing, check out Cleopatra Jones, TNT Jackson, or almost any Pam Grier movie. These movies had a lot of style and the people in them were actually cool. Undercover Brother had people trying to act cool, but it seemed pretty flat to me. Style: none.I was especially disappointed with Chris Kattan's character. I can't think of a weaker villain in any movie, even in spoofs. Dr. Evil? Mogatu? Mr. Feather is a lightweight with very little evil to him, in fact he is boring.There were some fun parts to the movie, but overall I can't really recommend it."
__label__1,"poorly executed text: This textbook is a mess. It is not elegant or clear, and their coverage of certain topics is confusing and deviates from standard practice.

__label__1,"A fairy tale: The book is supposily a true story, but I can tell you that several things in the book are basically Fiato's imagination or twisted reality of what really happened, He shows what kind of low-life he really is, more worried about everyone knowing he is sleeping with Nichole Simpson sister, which in truth is probibly the highlight of a lowlifes world.It is entertaining though because it seemed so new to me like I wasn't even there,but after reading it and comparing the realalities to the fantasy I could tell they just mislabeled it."
__label__2,"Enjoyable Reading: This book is very light reading but still gives a good education on seven of the most infamous military leaders in the general period between the 400's and the 1500's. Both photographs and Angus McBride's talented artwork excellently support the text. The warlords are: Flavius Aetius, the 'Last of the Romans' that beat Attila at Chalons; Gaiseric, pirate warlord of the Germanic Vandals in Africa; An Lu-Shan, a leader in China's medieval barbarian conflicts; Owen of Wales, a Celtic mercenary in French service; Bertrand Du Guesclin, a famous French knight of the Hundred Year's War, Jan Zizka, leader of a Christian revolt against Roman Catholic rule in Eastern Europe, and Vlad Tepes, the most dedicated and most vicious of the Crusaders to oppose the Ottoman Turks in the 16th Century."

__label__1,"Save your money: This movie is an insult to a child's intelligence. It belongs in the same plotless category as ""Santa Claus Versus the Martians."" The Pirate episode simply ended, with no explanation as to whether it was a dream or reality. The children kept reminding the pirates that stealing is bad, but they played along with the pirates.The next episode had a fire-breathing dragon that was chasing the children as often happens in a child's nightmare. The road was crumbling behind the children as they ran. My 4-year-old grandson was afraid for them.For plotless fun for small children, buy ""Shaun the Sheep"" or ""Pingu"" DVDs instead. Or buy a box of real Playmobil."

__label__1,"Limited Resources: When my daughter decided to get married in Southern Vermont, we were concerned about finding the resources we would need to plan a wedding outside our home area, but The Vermont Wedding Resource Guide promised to solve that problem. When the book arrived, it was difficult in some cases to tell where vendors were located (the town names were not always on the map provided), but eventually we figured out that most of the resources listed were for the Champlain and Burlington regions and the Manchester area (where our wedding is taking place) was sorely neglected. Also, the guide failed to provide the editorial information that would have helped us to find the vendors who fit the theme and tone of our wedding. This is not a guide, but a very limited ""yellow pages"" of resources."

__label__1,BORING: This game is sooo boring and the same as HALO 1 and 2 .. i think this game si like DOOM with a new skin!
__label__2,"Very good, but....: I really like this album. It makes a great soundscape for doing just about anything. I didn't give it the fifth star however, because it simply isn't as good as Liberation. That album is magical and really grabs your attention. If you don't have either, get liberation."
__label__1,"Another poorly made opera video: Yes, I must agree with David Cady. This bad habit of producing opera videos with careless post synching is a serious problem about which film producers are remarkably careless. I've worked in the music and film business all my life and know that this lack of care is simply intolerable and unnecessary. Opera is not a naturalistic medium, and any attempt to make it so by re-setting it out doors, in the wrong acoustic setting (such as this Bohème), or acting as if the singers are not singing but in a play, is risible. It is hard to believe that professionals such as Karajan and Zeffirelli should have allowed this to happen. The Domingo/Freni Butterfly is even worse. A great musical performance ruined by an inept video production. Other similar mis-matches would include Glyndebourne's fabulous Porgy and Bess and the Decca/Solti Bluebeard's Castle. Horrible post-synching. The list is endless, sadly."
__label__2,"The best first album of the 70s crossovers: do you really love music? can you visualize the momentum in culture by the music of that time? it's seminal to the rock and soul melting pot. we're not talking about electrifying the blues like the british groups. this isn't a group becoming a family, they're a family with an evolving identity enthusiastically obliterating the definitions of rock and soul. you could call it raw like the first three Prince albums [it's better], but there's no doubt that there's an equal love of music is there. the joy in life and truth is there. open your mind, hefe."

__label__1,"looks very nice but it is useless: I bought it because it looked nice and because it uses Smart Cards, but it is a flop. The menu is impossible to navigate, the manual not helpful at all, and the software that comes with it is basically useless. The manufacturer does not offer the patches required to make it work with Windows XP. The letters on the screen are hard to read. Good sound and the FM radio included is a good feature, but it is not worth the hassle of going through the installation. The buttons are confusing, too many functions in too few buttons. The remote control is even harder to use.After trying to instal it in a brand-new laptop I gave up and had to return it. Why not paying a bit more and getting a hard drive memory MP3 player with several GB that will allow one to store tons of music...that's what I did and bought a Zen NX Jukebox with 20 GB.

__label__2,"Excellent Short Stories -- And At Least One Is True: Of the story The Snake, another reviewer wrote that it was ""a revelation..sure the symolism is almost Victorian, but the eerie combination of perfectly observed rituals of nature and the almost primeval sexual hunger of the woman to see the mice being eaten was incredibly subversive and unexpected in a setting of such clinical austerity..it was almost Hitchcockian in its perversity.""Fact is, according to Steinbeck in ""About Ed Ricketts,"" that incident occurred almost exactly as described -- and all the author had to do was write it down."

__label__1,"A disappointing novel: Disappointing. My first hint that the writing wouldn't be great was that the entire back cover of the book was a portrait of Ms. Roberts. I opened the front cover to see the list of prior publications, and it covered two entire pages in a tiny font. The story is compelling - but it suffers by lack of attention to the craft of writing. If you aren't bothered by clumsy constructions or overused words and phrases, then you will probably find the story engaging and not even notice these. But if these little details grate on your nerves, then I recommend passing on this trilogy. I won't be reading the other two books in the trilogy."
__label__1,"Too Expensive to be so Cheap: This is the second one of these I've owned, the first failed because the wiring separated from the top of the switch mechanism. It worked like that for a while but then started to intermittently not react to commands. So I bought another. In less than a year the rubber wire attachment at the top of the remote has opened up and exposed the copper wiring underneath. It still works fine, but I am waiting for it to start failing me. I don't like to have potential problems lurking in my camera bag so this really causes me anxiety. I'm thinking of buying the cheaper after-market one as a backup for when this does stop working.Bottom Line: the above review is the review I would expect to read for the cheap after-market version. Instead, the reviews are better for that one and it's less than $10!"

__label__1,Surprised: I book was what I wanted but very surprised open up the cover to find the book was a personnel message in it to someone by the name of Jan ....... with a message to this person and someones signature. I really did not want a used book that had a personnel message in it and dated. So I am not very happy about this. Havent decided if I want to return this or not.

__label__2,"Nice To Have Ya Back!: The best Fourplay album in years. Eventhough, I've bought every album, the past three albums just didn't move me as much. However, this album is the Fourplay I grew up on. All the tracks are soothing and typical of the Fourplay sound that's good for any occassion. My favorites are definitely Cool Train, Avalabop, and Firehouse Chill. Those are the three I play the CD cover off when in the ride. I didn't know until last week this album had even been released. Well, it was definitely worth the wait cuz the Jazz that's being released right now is definitely oversaturated Pop Jazz, and I'm glad Fourplay took it back to the way it's supposed to be done."
__label__2,Great Tool: This is a great thing to have! I have always had trouble doing situps sliding my feet under my couch but not anymore. It is very comfortable and the fact that it folds up I don't have to worry about stubbing my pinky toe and throwing a chair across the room.
__label__2,"My favorite 'go-to' guide: This is such a wonderful resourse! I have it on hand at all times for when 'something's just not quite right' with one of my doggies. As has been mentioned, it contains a chapter for every part of your pet. Excessive sratching?: Chapter six has almost 20 pages devoted to hair and skin disorders. Chapter nine lists over twenty pages concerning 'spine, limbs, and paws. And on and on...it literally covers every square inch of your pet. It also contains a handy ""Symptoms Quickfinder"" chart, and and a great ""list of recommended dosages"" chart, that gives you dosages for everything from aspirin to Zinc. I could go on and on, but I guarantee, you will never be disappointed you purchased this book!"
__label__2,"great book to promote change where it's needed.: This book is written specifically for churches that don't feel that their voice is reaching our current culture. Leonard Sweet, a postmodern visionary, applies much of the trends written about in his book SoulTsunami to the church, encouraging it to grow and change not the central message of Christianity, but rather the containers we present it in. Sweet does not get too specific about methods within the book, but rather presents a ""jumping off point"" in each chapter for churches to transform themselves. Each chapter ends with ideas for discussion and activities to apply many of the concepts discussed. AquaChurch is not a panacea in and of itself, and does not claim to be, but it acts as a much better tool; it promotes growth within each church's personal context."
__label__1,Not up to the expectation: This one is no better than normal component video out put. I tested this with my other DVDplayer with a component video out put on a 58 inch panasonic plasma. I could not make any difference between this player and that one.I strongly discourage some one who wants to see a difference between and component video output and a HDMI output. Infact this player does not play some of the R/W formats of DVD.
__label__1,Didn't Work Once: We just bought this. It wouldn't even work once. It would not hold any pressure upon being pumped up. The seals to the pump appeared to be defective. This seems to corroborate the other more recent reviews. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is either a scam or very poorly made.
__label__1,"Installs DRM spyware, 'Steam version' or not: I played this game over at a friend's house a few times, and I have to say, regardless of it'svisual appeal, the gameplay is repetitive and quickly boring. 1 star + 2 big mehs.And despite that Steam spammer/fanboy's claims, the Steam version also installs Securom DRM spyware, just like the retail/dvd version, just a slightly watered-down version. You ware warned."
__label__1,"LA Listener wants money back: Glampire's 'Beggining of Terror' was the worst 14 dollars I ever spent. It lacked originality, creativity and to be honest, talent. If I want to listen to the Cure, or NIN, I will buy the original, not some cheezy knock-off. Do not buy."
__label__1,"Outdated, names are limited: While this book has a great concept, it is not a practical buy for modern parents considering names for their children. Its name selection is VERY limited and even though it was published in 1990, surprisingly lacks reference to many names that were popular in that timeframe, such as Jennifer, Jessica, and Jason. My husband and I are pregnant with our first child and are torn between a few common names, NONE of which were referenced in this book. That said, this book is not helpful to us."
__label__1,"Complete waste of money: This may be the worst third party manual I've ever purchased. It is sophomoric, condesending and poorly edited. Three-quarters of the book is nothing more than a review of the Flash 4 manual. The remainder will do little to help beginning, intermediate or experienced Flash users. Keep in mind that it was published by MacroMedia - should have noticed that before I bought it."
__label__1,"Worked for 1 day: The product was received in a timely manner. I was able to use it for one day ok, on the second day part of the screen went black and could not correct the problem so I returned it."
__label__1,"Awful Coffee Maker: We got this as a wedding gift and it is terrible. The Carafe is very hard to pour and pours slow. The coffee maker doesn't make the coffee very hot, and for some reason, it always overflows and spills all over the counter and floor. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk."
__label__1,"Did Kellerman write this?: There are so many ludicrous and unbelievable aspects to this plot that it seems that this book might have been written as a joke. It displays none of the polish and continuity of the Alex Delaware novels. The coincidences are far too outlandish, the characters unbelievable. Definitely reads like a rush to a dealine. A great disappointment to this Kellerman fan."
__label__1,"Never put in dishwasher--really!!!: Got brand new set and put a couple of pieces in the dishwasher, before using. The outer finish was absolutely, utterly ruined! I guess American consumers are getting used to ""made in China"" workmanship, but I want to know how many of today's busy two-parent working families really want to spend time washing pans by hand! Really?On my set, the only indication that the dishwasher would harm the outer finish was in small print, at the very end of the verbiage about how fabulous they are. I am very disappointed, and plan to return them. Stupid. I have other non-stick pans that don't have this problem at all."
__label__2,Awesome: This pillow is simply awesome! I have Cervical DDD and don't get much sleep with this pillow I slept better than I have in the past year. So happy I purchased it. Gonna buy a spare for to have at my parents!!
__label__2,"get TWO!: This was the BEST thing we got for a baby shower gift. The motor gave out after being played over and Over and OVER and **OVER** again every night for 5 years. He wanted a replacement one but we finally convinced him it was for babies and he was too grown up for it. As another reviewer said, it would be better if it played longer - our son would just be drifting off and it would shut off, then he would pop back awake & start it over again."
__label__2,"Great surround speakers: I just bought these as surrounds for my system. I have 120x in front with a CRC7 center and a CR4 sub. I am really really happy with all of the speakers I bought. The 110s and 120s have very clean and open highs and mid. The bass is not there, but the sub picks it up just fine. I highly recommend these speakers."
__label__1,"Great at first: My son loved the toy and couldn't wait to get it opened, but the problem came when we tried to close it back up. The treasuer box would not close back up easily. I had to work at it very hard, my son who is 7 could not close it by himself. He got pretty frustrated."
__label__2,"An inspiraion to be YOURSELF...: In this debut album, Pink not only displays wonderful Pop/R&B grooves, but strongly encourages individuality, and not to try so hard to ""fit it."" She certainly is one lady with attitude and edge!Pink jumps from funky dance tracks like ""You Make Me Sick"" and ""Most Girls"" to slow, strong vocal songs such as ""Stop Falling"" and ""You Oughta Know."" Pink is a very talented lady not only when it comes to vocals, but she's an excellent dancer and performer."
__label__2,(Don't) Drop the beat: Great dance track with a very good bass line and a great melody provided by two different songs: DOCTOR BEAT by Gloria Estefan with Miami Sound Machine and DROP THE PRESSURE by Mylo.It reminds me of the good remixes we had in Europe in the eighties: TOM's DINER by DNA or P4F with a mix of P.Machinery with Duran Duran's NOTORIOUS.It's a track you can play at a party and you can be sure that everybody will be on the dancefloor at the second they hear the bass line.
__label__2,"Excellent: This book was AWESOME !!! I absolutely fell in love with Trae. His character was put together so well! she really gave you a mental picture for him and all of the other participating charcters for that matter. She really out did herself with this one!! It was waaaayyyy better than ""Thugs and the women that love them"" All I have to say is I cant wait till part three."
__label__2,Elemental Desires: I loved the vairous stories. Each story using the elements in a whole new hot way. Each story is a page turner and so hot.
__label__1,"dvd missing from case: I recieved my order and notice the plastic wrapping had been torn, thinking it must have happened during packing I just put it aside till I had time to watch the movie, about a week later. I removed the remainer of the plastic to open the case and in doing so i discovered the dvd wasn't in the case. It appears that someone creased the plastic to remove my dvd. More quality checks need to be done before shipping. I have sent two emails requesting a replacement but have yet heard from ecom. The dvd in question is Lakeview Terrace."
__label__1,"Don't bother: Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her ""love interest"", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book."
__label__2,"I come at this from a peculiar angle...: I have read a number of Grafton's alphabet mysteries and I found them to be good but a bit tedious (3 stars or so). However, I've taken to listening to them as books on tape and have found them to be quite enjoyable. Judy Kaye does a fantastic job as the voice of Kinsey (she has her wry sense of humor nailed - her voice perfectly matches Grafton's words - whovever cast Kaye as the voice of Milhone should get 5 stars) and I find the books to be quite enjoyable.I do agree with other reviewers that the ending was a bit clunky, but the rest of the book built up enough tension and drama to still give the book an above-average rating in my estimation."
__label__2,Came on time: I bought this book for my uncle and it came right on time before he had to travel. He has not read it yet but the condition of the book was as stated and in great condition.
__label__1,"Bad Product: I have to join the chorus in stating that these disks just do not work. I even tried to burn at a slower speed, different software, etc. I went out and purchased some TDKs and all of a sudden everything worked.Beware! Nero (and other software) may burn it without reporting an error, but it will probably fail verification. I would have had a very nasty surprise down the road if I did not perform the verification at burn time.NEC-3550A DVD drive."
__label__1,"Throw it back: Sure I could listen to this but why would I when I could put in Live at Leeds? All talk, no walk kitschy cheeze. I'd rather listen to Poison."
__label__2,Excellent Product: This product was high quality and works great... It did require slight modification (I bent the tabs a bit) to get it to mate with my board... I am very pleased...
__label__1,Not as fun as the original: I got this for my kids from Santa because one of my sisters and I used to love to play the original version of the game (with people). They have really went down in quality in the years since. The game was falling apart the first day. If I had spent much on this I would have been really disappointed.
__label__2,"One of the best albums I've heard this year: The review I read for this album compared it to Sparklehorse and Grandaddy. Fair enough, if you like them then, yeah, chances are you'll be open to this. Personally I'd have said that comparisons with Mogwai, The For Carnation or Kingsbury Manx would have painted a fuller picture. Not that easy to categorise then but, like each of those artists, Thee More Shallows have created an album that doesn't quite sound like anyone else. No immediate hooks, but nothing to put you off playing it again, and again, fresh delights revealing themselves each time. I've played it almost exclusively for the past three weeks and haven't peaked with it yet. You can really get your money's worth from an album like this, one for a future ""all time favourites"" list."
__label__2,"Like a hike with good friends ...: A Blistered Kind of Love is a terrific account of one couple as they trek the Pacific Crest Trail. The narrative alternates between authors Angela and Duffy Ballard, and that sets the book apart from other hiking memoirs. Seeing the hike from both perspectives invites the reader to share the experience with greater depth than most single-perspective narratives. It's almost as if we get to alternate sharing the trail with each author, hearing ones view of the trail tale before we hang back and join the other, listening to the same story with that author's particular way of looking at the adventure. Very quickly, the reader gets the sense of being on a hike with good friends. It helps that both writers do a terrific job of letting us see through their eyes. This book is strongly recommended for hikers, adventurers, and people interested in the way relationships develop in extreme situations."
__label__2,Beautiful: This DVD is truly amazing. I love each and every song. I am developing quite a collection. It has become a bedtime ritual of watching these before going to sleep. Wonderful way to end the day.
__label__2,"Inconsistent, but still one of my favorites: Season 1 of Leverage was pretty solid through and through, Season 2 began what I feel to be a hit-and miss trend, and Season 3 continues what Season 2 started, both good and bad.Now, I love the show - even the episodes that I feel are not very strong are still fun and overall entertaining. The episodes that ARE strong may be the strongest of the series, but unfortunately are not as plentiful as in previous seasons. Missing more than other seasons is the slick ""flow"" that reminded me, in prior episodes, of a 42 minute Ocean's movie each week.It's still well written, funny, high-tech and worth watching - it just feels like its slipped a bit from its previously high elevation."
__label__1,"Not as good as Hopkirk or Keay: This book is not more than adequate: it is a reasonably exhaustive collection of events and character portraits from the Great Game over the last couple of centuries, but it does little analysis and is drily written.Much of the same history (at least pre-World War II) has been addressed by Peter Hopkirk and John Keay, and those two writers have much more ability to bring the subject to life. This volume is not entirely redundant to their works, but would really only be of interest to someone greatly interested in Central Asia and requiring the complete works on the topic."
__label__2,"Sweden - so neutral, so rocking: These guys let it rip right from the get go. 13 petal-to-the-metal, another-shot-of-beer songs, each with a pop hook the size of Scandinavia. They admittedly fall victim to the kingdom of cheddar occasionally, but all is forgiven (explained?) due to their 'foreign matter' status. I don't know if English is their second language or not, but in either case, they have learned all the necessary rock n' roll lingo and then some. All that can be said is this is flat out rock - period. Crunchy, catchy and fun. Gratuitous musical comparison = mix The Fluid's musical melody with Monster Magnetish vocals and a Supersuckerish attitude and you just created The Deadbeats. Great disc for those who don't always need high IQ music to drink (and drive) to. Let it rip."
__label__1,Not the Greatest Seller: So I guess I should have waited to purchase my PAP2 until my internet problem at home was resolved but I didn't. It therefore took me about 5-6 weeks before I was able to test out the device which does not work. The seller will not accept the defective item because I waited too long to try to return it. I paid over $70 for the ATA device and now have to go out and buy a new one. I will not use this seller again and I probably will look to purchase an ATA device from a different manufacturer.
__label__2,"This CD is hot from start to Finish: I think most people can agree that this isnt as good as GRODT. But give credit were credit is due. This CD will be one of if not the best rap albums of the year. Every song is hot and his lyrics are sick, espceially on Baltimore love thing, piggy bank, hate it or love it and the list goes on and on. Mad props to 50.GGGGGGGGGGG-unit!!!"
__label__2,"SCREAMING EAGLE SITS ALONE!!!: In college I had a buddy who was partial to ""our ladies of girth"". Now, this friend, lets call him ""Roy"" always used to tell me that his nickname for these said ladies was, ""Screaming Eagles."" I never really delved into the etymology of the phrase, but I had a feeling it was moist, love-handled and ready to leverage.I recently purchased this shirt for my ""Roy"". He was delighted. Now, along with his chivalrous attitude for his heavy nights he could be attaired in style.Truly, when you purchase this shirt and hit the night for a prowling adventure into the deep esteemless night. Just before you reach into the caverns of heavey bliss thank ""Roy"" for being a trailblazer.Remember, rock infinitely."
__label__1,"NEVER BUY AN ARCHOS PRODUCT!: I had problems as soon as I opened the box. The player keeps freezing during play, data becomes corrupt, the sound is of poor quality, and advertising up to 20 movies storage space is not possible. The most I could ever get on my player was 5, and that was when the playback quality was set on low. I tried to have it serviced just 2 months into a 1 year ""warranty"" and they said it was going to cost me $150.00 to repair. If you purchase this product, you will be sorry!"
__label__1,"Piece of Junk: Do not waste your money on this thing. It could fit a very large pumpkin (it's ""oversized"") and looks very little like the photo, which was obviously of a prototype or movie prop. The mask isn't even the same color, it is a crappy gray color and warped and floppy rather than tight and defined as pictured. One eye socket is turned inwards so badly it can't be worn. I would send it back but the shipping cost and hassle aren't worth it. Shame on the seller for using such a misleading picture!!"
__label__2,"Quick, Fun Read: I would actually give this book 4 1/2 stars. There were some(very few)slow spots in this book, but overall great book! I loved the main character's outlook on Valentine's day, it even went on to explore why she hated it so much. It showed the ghosts of Valentine's Day, just as a Christmas Carol does but much more interesting in my opinion.This was a quick, fun read and I will be looking for other stuff by this author!"
__label__2,Yasutomo Gel Xtreme...Love These Gel Pens!: These are also some of the best quality gel pens around...always smooth writing and drawing with a lot of options for all kinds of paper crafts. I love these as well as the Sakura Gelly Roll brand. Enjoy!!
__label__2,Better than the original: These replacement heads seem to work better than the originals that came with the shaver and the originals were very good.
__label__1,"Yeah, it's bad: Here's what I did first day I got this: Put the stone on the lowest rack of my cold oven, then set the oven to 550, and let it fully heat up for 30 minutes. I used the peal that comes with the set, which is not really large enough to hold a good size pizza. So I get the first pizza into the oven, let it bake for 5 minutes, pizza is looking good! I open the oven to check the crust - CRACK! Well, the crack doesn't seem to effect it's ability to bake pizza. I baked a second pizza just after the first, they both came out fine. On top of which, the stone got really burnt, and I doubt I'll ever get it clean, leaving me to worry it will impart a burnt taste to whateve gets baked in there nowThe small peal is a bit of a pain - but cracking on the very first use - even if it is still quite usable - is ridiculous.The product I bought was cheap - and I got what I paid for..."
__label__2,"Fun and Exciting book that will help you so much.: I'm fourteen, two years into being a teenager and the 7 habbits of highly effective teens has so much information and advice that will make you a much happier person. It's up to beat with comics and great little qoutes. It's diffently helped me become a happier and better person."
__label__1,"Don't waste your money or time.: Don't buy this CD.I can't believe I just typed that, but it is my strong advice for any fan of Eminem's previous releases.Some tracks are very good, such as ""Mosh"", ""Evil Deeds"", ""Never Enough"". Even ""Toy Soldiers"" and ""Yellow Brick Road"" feature unique beats and articulate lyrics. The rest of the tracks are totally opposite. Lyrics are jumbled, often don't even rhyme, and sometimes just make no sense. There isn't any of the sharp wit or humor of his previous releases. Far too many of these tracks feature farting and burping sounds, Pee-Wee Herman screeching, and monotonous singing of inane chorus lines.After watching Eminem's ""Mosh"" video, I was very excited for the release of this CD. I am fairly tolerant of artists changing their style, but after playing it through several times, I can no longer stand it. I am literally embarassed to play this CD in public. This may end up being Eminem's last CD, whether he planned it or not."
__label__2,"One of the best series I've ever had the pleasure to read!!: I can't remember when I got so caught up in a book . After I read every single one of the books,I couldn't wait for the next one in the series to come out. I am really hoping there will be a fifth book in the series. We need to find out what happens to the baby. The last one in the series, The Voyager, was just as great as all the rest, but it didn't end the whole story line for me. It left me wanting more, so I have been watching the book stores with baited breath waiting for the next one to come out. PLEASE HURRY!!!!"
__label__2,"Top It Can Caps are Nearly Tops!: These can caps are pretty terrific! They fit regular soda cans very well and it's easy to drink from them. They do keep the fizz in longer than an open can. My only complaint is that they aren't totally spill-proof, although they don't claim to be. I'd buy them again if I needed more."
__label__2,"One the Best TV Detective Ever: A real Who-Dun-It. Easy to follow stories, like Murder She Wrote (which it is patterned after). Just like Murder She Wrote, which came much latter, it has ever old Movie, Stage, TV Star drafted to play it. It is kind of great fun to see them in their twilight years. Enjoyed ever Episode. Something that can be watched over and over and still be fun."
__label__2,"Good patent info, Some far-fetched themes are covered.: This book provides much information of Telsa's patents. AC motor and other apparatus are covered, the bulk of the book pertains to Tesla's ""Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Frequency and High Potential"" Wireless power and ""Death Ray"" are critiqued. The other stuff in the book (Atlantis, Mars, saucers, etc.) seems to be almost purely speculative and should be taken with a generous grain of salt. In the end there is a copy of the supreme court documents associated with the demolition of Wardencyffe Tower.Adam Parker"
__label__2,Great Chair: I used this from the time my son was 3 months old. It reclines almost as far back as an infant car seat and adjusts to almost straight up and everywhere in between. The only drawback is that it is a pain to take apart and clean and I have yet to figure out how to get the straps off to wash.I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want a full size high chair.
__label__1,"Didn't like it at all.: The colors of the art work were far too lurid.Not what the poet had in mind. The art work did not reflect the poetry at all.I returned the copy and bought a copy of the original book, which has black and white pen drawings and shows the true feelings of the author and the works."
__label__1,"Disappointed: As an Anne Rice fan, having read all the horror series about vampires and witches, I was extremely disappointed with the book. I found too little story line and what was there, was preposterous. The writing did not set up the scenes very well, so it was hard to visualize the action."
__label__2,"Good watch for the price: I thought this was a very good watch for the price. I have only had it for a couple of days. It is fairly light, however if you have a big wrist you may want to consider another watch, because it could be a tight fit. It is a velcro band, so just a sports watch 100%. I wear it while running. The timer is great on this thing. It is also very easy to read, which is important to me while running."
__label__2,"American Polkas on Parade: I recently picked up this cd at a local store in Denver just to try it out. Although there were some interesting choices of repertoire and musicians (leading off with Wanda and Stephanie didn't exactly encourage me to continue listening!) I was pleasantly surprised at the mix of musical styles and overall level of playing. I particularly enjoyed ""Zivio Slovenci"" by The Al Meixner Trio- which had a unique blend of a driving Cleveland- Slovenian beat, solid accordion work and tight 3 part harmonies.... If there are any other CDs out by this group in specific I'd definitely recommend checking them out... Besides that John Gora and Gorale, the Polka Quads and Eric Knoltkamper turn in some great contemporary American polka performances, next to classic cuts by Happy Louie and Markic and Zagger."
__label__1,"Inoperable -- returned: When I connected the machine, it wouldn't recognize my multimedia CD's to record music. I purchased a spindle of TDK audio CD blanks which it recognized. But when I attempted to record, I found the recording level control was inoperative. I returned the unit."
__label__1,"a come on: I bought this because it says starring Tony Sirico,Tony is more of acameo ,the main guy in this I remember in a oldPacific Blue episode.Kind of funny but just average entertainment"
__label__2,"Good watch: Good watch, I am wearing it daily since I bought approximately a month back. Only drawback is that the strap is big, might need to make another hole later."
__label__2,Great Book: I found this book to be excellent. I read the Killer Angels before I read Gods and Generals and Jeff Shaara does a great job following in his fathers footsteps. I especially liked how it covers many different peoples thoughts like Lee and Hancock and etc. This book was excellent.
__label__2,"Great book, but not for beginners: I was very happy with the contents of this book, but it isn't intended for beginners. Much of the content of the book is also available from the ZenGarden website."
__label__1,"Boring: Lots of scenes from Iran which for someone who travels there from time to time is not anything special. Kind of depressing melancholic mood, tone, sound, color. Depressing movie. Waste of time if you ask me - I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry."
__label__2,works great: I only used it once but it did what it was suppose to do Keep cold I would recommend this product
__label__2,"""ALFA & ZULU"" Do The Trick!: Thanks to K6YB for writing the ""ALFA & ZULU"" book! It fit our needs EXACTLY! I gave it to my 11 year old son for Christmas, and he is now passing sample tech exams! We plan to go to a testing session as soon as possible. Now we're working on the code, and have ordered the ""DIT & DAH"" Phoneticode card and dice games advertised in the book."
__label__2,"Great Album: Great Album. Good for my collection of great R&B, blues and jazz women singers. Will buy more like it. Thanks."
__label__2,Pretty good: This cd was good. Most of the songs are good but some of the songs could use a little help. Mambo no.5 is a great song. But track 2 is not very good. I think this is a good cd.
__label__1,RUINED BY THRILLER CLICHES: THIS FILM IS VERY ENTERTAINING BUT (LIKE LOTS OF THESE TYPE OF MOVIES) GETS RUINED BY THRILLER CLICHES. LEAVE OUT THE THRILLER CLICHES AND YOU HAVE A GREAT MOVIE.
__label__2,"The Greatest Rock Compilation of All Times!: I have been a fan of The Police for 22 years. If you are not a fan already, after listening to this 4 CD set, you will become a lifelong one. The Police take you on a musical journey through their punk days, to the more polished and melodic hits that we know and love. Sting is an incredible storyteller ! Through his music you learn about the political war his first wife's family endured in ""Invisible Sun"", to love lost and found. You could feel the intense love and passion Stewart Copeland, Sting, and Andy Summers pour into each each song. BUY IT!"
__label__1,"REVIEW UPDATE: Foreign particles in food, seemingly bad design: I originally gave this product a five star review but after using this food grinder several times I noticed gray or black metallic looking material in our ground meat. Friday when I was putting away the food grinder parts I noticed a black/gray substance rubbing off onto my hand or fingers. It seems as other reviewers have written the food grinder is literally eating itself up. I can not state whether the gray/black substance found in the meat, and behind the blade is metal, but it sure looks like it could be. (I noticed the metal gray or black material behind the cutter and grinding plate when washing it.) I am sending this back to ecom as this seems to be a poorly designed product. Normally KitchenAid makes good products so I am surprised how this one did not work right.Finally, the ground meat turns out very light and tender. It's too bad there might me foreign matter in it because of this seemingly poor design.Do not recommend."
__label__2,"Emerils Theres a Chef in My Soup: Bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter. Looking forward to making several recipes with her. Its a very good book to get the kids involved in the kitchen. What child wouldn't want to make Peanut Butter, jelly and marshmallow creme sandwiches!"
__label__2,"Excellent CD: Sting's son sounds, well, just like Sting, in an almost eerie way. But this isn't a bad thing at all I found, the CD is moving and the music is a nice break from all of the annoying rap/metal/teeny bopper/pseudo-punk alternative garbage filling the air these days.The lyrics are pop lyrics, simple, in an almost ColdPlay sort of way, but manage to carry themselves nicely despite their cynicism and are the stuff of classic songs and bands from the 70's and 80's.The CD gets a little stale near the end but the majority of the songs are extremely enjoyable, catchy, and carry an edge.The band's youthfulness shows through in their lyrics, but over-all the music is quite mature and advanced, very impressive!I highly recommend this CD even if you're in your 30's like me and enjoyed U2, The Police and are into some of the newer British bands like the Dandy Warhols, Interpol, Doves and some ColdPlay among others."
__label__1,"Very cheap scent: I got this one because I saw people talking about it in a beauty forum and they recommended it as a nice citrus scent. Boy, aren't they wrong... Not only I don't smell anything citrusy, the scent also smells very cheap, and teenagery. If you are used to the designer brand types of perfumes like me, don't even bother to try this out. So I think this is on me to trust those recommendations online so easily.And the worst part, you can't even return it, because ecom lists this as hazardous material, therefore you can't return it. Definitely lesson learned on my part..."
__label__1,"Horrible waste of time: Granted, I'm not some movie critic/artist but I know a good movie when I see one and this is not it. Great acting - but still can't pull off no plot, minimal dialogue, no point, nothing touching, nothing funny. Margot's character seems to change who she is at the drop of a hat - is that supposed to be the point? No ending, no story. Am I supposed to think it is creative b/c you show a woman masturbating and can use the F word in a thousand creative ways??? Wish I could get the time back that I watched it. If you're looking for great acting and a story, watch ""The Savages."" That was a great movie where I could really focus on the acting, but still had a story line and an ending, without assailing me with pointless foul language every two seconds."
__label__2,"Mum, 8 year old daughter & 5 year old son LOVE it.: This is a hit! My daughter didn't like the look of it when she got it for Xmas as she had preconceived ideas about what sort of kids play chess. When we finally played it late January she decided she loves it, as do I and as does her 5 year old brother. They ask me ""Can we play No Stress Chess please"". A fantastic way to introduce chess. I always regretted never having learnt to play and now I can learn as well. I highly recommend this game........"
__label__1,"Not for Mac: Not good at all if you use a Mac. It didn't work with OS X 10.2. When I emailed Iomega tech support they said they don't support anything later than OS 9.1, and wern't too aplogetic about it. Too bad that OS went out of date almost 2 years ago. This might be a good drive, especially if it was still 1999, but it's 2002 and Iomega needs get with the game."
__label__2,"An Inspiring Book for Everyone with Tweens in their Life!: Tween Timemade me realize that parenting isn't a passive sport and inspired me to actively engage with my tweens and children. Not only are the ideas great ideas, they are easy, fun and inexpensive. Too often I just try to get through the day with my children, and this book made me realize that every interaction is an opportunity to connect with my kids and help them navigate through the often tumultous tween times!I lovedTween Timeso much I am buying for all of my parent friends and packaging it with a journal so that they can begin their own grateful journals, which is one of the easy, thought provoking activities contained in the book!"
__label__2,"Best Tom Sawyer: I won't add much to the other reviews. But Jody Foster is quite cute as Becky Thatcher. Although the lovely songs are by the Sherman brothers, the incidental music is by some guy named John Williams - one of his early efforts. Completists might want to make a note of that. Therefore the music played when Tom is running through the field (mentioned in another review) is John Williams'."
__label__1,"DRM ruined a nice game: I was looking forward to buy this game until I found out EA used SecuROM on it, I own a laptop and a desktop, that's 2 installs, I constantly upgrade my desktop and get a new laptop on yearly basis, am I to fight with EA over why I need to install it a 4th time? no thanks, I get games to relax and have fun, not to build up stress asking/fighting EA to let me use the game I paid for. If I can listen my music CDs in my car, my stereo, my laptop, my desktop, etc. without asking music companies permission for it, why can't I expect to do the same with a game, why can't I freely enjoy something I would pay for?. I'll find something else to do with my money and my time. Great way to ruin a great product, cheers EA!."

__label__1,"Ouch, a Passport lemon!: I dig much of what Doldinger and his various Passport bands have done. (See my review of Passport To Paradise.) Unfortunately, this album is not one such case. Apparently, either Klaus or Atlantic decided to try to cash in on the disco craze with a bunch of ""four-on-the-floor"" drum beats, predictable major key melodies, and--oh, yes--vocoderized singing. But like most such attempts by jazz and/or fusion artists, the results were lame. (I knew there was a reason I got into new wave and punk around that time.) Having recently rediscovered my fondness for early Passport, and not having any reviews to go by, I took a chance on ""Oceanliner."" Don't you make the same mistake."

__label__2,"Mandela (1987): Mandela(1987) as portrayed by Danny Glover is one of those classic movies/documentaries one would wantto keep in his library. It's been many years since i saw this film, and i must admit that despite mytender age of 13 when my family was owning this film, its memory is still intact.It's unfortunate that the film is not available in DVD today. But, even in VHS quality and availability, someantiques, the notable of this film never surrenders to the new ones.Danny Glover was extremely outstanding in his portrayal of Nelson Mandela's struggles for South Africa-tusslingwith the security apparatus of the Apartheid regime(the apparent machinery of the government), haggling in courts for his peoples' rights to vote, his seduction and woo of Winnie Madikizela, and his versatile disposition[s] in dealing with the day to day challengesof a 'segregated society' before he was sent to languish in jail."
__label__2,"Get this back in print!: OK, I have not read this book, and until I can get access to a library that has it I am unlikely to, as I don't have $200 plus to spend on it.But even if I read this in a library I would still want it in my collection. I like to have books, especially poetry books, around to help with my thining. After reading them I leave them out for a few months (or until my wife insists I put them away) and bring them back out regulalry. This books contains material on several poets that are important to me (Du Fu for example) or at least I think it does.I may have to start my own publishing company to keep books like this in print for the average poetry reader (there is such a person) who is not ecsconsed in a university library."
__label__1,"""In Darwin's Shadow"" aptly titled: Michael Shermer's attempt at analyzing the life and work of Wallace falls short on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin. One thing is sure, he has done more to darken the shadow than lift it from, arguably next to Darwin, Victorian England's greatest naturalist.Shermer's attempt to identify Wallace as a ""heretic personality"" is vague and inconsistly applied. The claim that Wallace succumbed to scientism is so wide of the mark that once the astonishment of the claim wears off one is left wondering if Shermer ever really read Wallace!This is simply the worst of an increasing number of Wallace biographies. Ill conceived and poorly argued, for those seeking to know this fascinating naturalist better almost any starting place would be better than here. My suggestion? Start with Wallace himself,MY LIFE: A Record of Events and Opinion."
__label__1,"It does not work at all!: After reading the reviews, we decided to purchase this one. The delivery is fast and the package looks nice. But the product does NOT work at all.

__label__2,"House of Cards Blu-Ray: One of my favorite TV series looks great on Blu-Ray. Problem is that there is commentary on the first episode, but when the commentary is playing, the subtitles don't work, so you don't know what the actors are saying. Subtitles work are fine if the commentary is off. First time I've run into this problem on any DVD.Nevertheless, love the commentary by, among others, Ian Richardson."
__label__2,A Nice Surprise: I bought this book because I bought some other Frank Asch books and I really like this one also. It is a great book that shows the relationship between a father and child.

Bummer cuz I really like the petite horn to complement my petite white gold strong chain to place it on."
__label__1,DO NOT USE FOR CONNECTING TWIN BEDS: ecom suggested these when I bought a foam connector for twin beds. Do not buy them to connect two twin beds. They are not long enough and the metal clasp would be very uncomfortable on a mattress.

__label__2,"Killer Keller: This is Keller at his best. He finally released a studio album that is like the Keller that we all know, a solo one. A half vocal and half instrumental mix keeps this unique album exciting. His great lyrics and technical expertise on the umpteen instruments he plays on this album, makes ownership a requirement."
__label__1,"Worked fine for 1 year: I bought this machine about 1 year ago. I agree 100% with the other reviews that the carafe doesn't seem to ""fit"" right into the machine - and I have experienced a few overflows due to this issue. Otherwise, the machine worked okay until yesterday. I went to put the carafe into the machine and it wouldn't fit at all, couldn't even wiggle it in. I did some looking and it turns out a piece of plastic in the brewing mechanism was broken. This piece is critical to the brew process - I tried brewing without it and the coffee wouldn't come out and simply brewed into the machine. I tried searching Mr. Coffee's website for a replacement but they don't sell one and neither does ecom. Guess that means I have to shell out $45 for a new machine, 1 year later.In summary, the machine works fine for a while, but my next purchase will be on a machine that can last more than 12 months."
__label__2,Great product: Because I cannot do stairs we wanted to train our new puppy with potty pads. Until we found something to hold them they were Sophie's best and favorite toy. This tray has helped us through the silly season of potty training and now has become the proper place for her to 'go'.
__label__1,"Slowly paced and awkward: It seems that many devout Christians love this portrayal of Jesus as more human than divine, but it simply didn't work for me. Part of the problem lies in the acting, which simply isn't that believable (i.e., Harvy Keitel). An even bigger obstacle is the dialogue given to the characters. Not only does it sound unnatural, but some of it seems to go against the traditional teachings of the Bible. Consider, for example, the scene where Jesus gets a little angry, picks up an axe (yes, an axe!), and declares war. Apparently he decided that whole ""love thy neighbor"" thing just wasn't working anymore. The biggest drawback to the film, though, is its length. Clocking in at over 2 hours 40 minutes, it has dillusions of grandeur. Rather than the greatest story ever told, you'll see lots and lots of sand, as well as miracles presented like parlor tricks."
__label__2,Thank you James Carville!: This book is a turbo charged read from front to back. This book is straight up with info and great recipes! I miss this kind of passion and brilliant logic from a kick ass progressive like Carville.

This is not always practical. The tripod mount fits too loose on Spyder and easily falls off. I think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product, but not yet ready for prime time."
__label__2,this CD kicks some major butt: this CD is one of the coolest CD's that I.C.P has ever made and if you don't think so you can bite it because if you're a true juggalo you won't care what it sounds like you'll just listen to it and love it.

I just want to back them up on how good these books are. I wnat to know when she is going to come out with the 3rd book. I can't wait! If any one knows anything about a 3rd book PLEASE tell me! Or maybe if you know about any other books by her other than the Eleanor one. Thanx!
__label__1,Skylink AD-433S Emergency Dialer: Instructions are marginal; fortunately I am technical enough to read. Big problem for me is that it will not dial over my VOIP line but that was never stated in product specs (that I could find). I don't know whether it is design relatd or defective dialer. I use Vonage system. Do not recommend purchase.
__label__2,"Avent deserves an A+: We are very pleased with our Avent purchases. We have no leakage problems and these wide bottles are easy to wash. I am not sure if other systems have this, but Avent has ""adjustable flow"" nipples. These nipples have 3 settings for flow, depending on how you hold the bottle. So, when our baby grows and needs more flow, we don't have to buy new nipples or poke new holes. Avent also has a small microwave sterilizer that can sterilize 4 bottles at a time...we use it all the time for bottles, pacifiers, etc."
__label__2,"One of my all-time-favorites...: Well, my first encounter with MacArthur Park was on a german late-night radio show, where they played it full-length. It immediately caught my attention. It is quite probably the most glorious piece of american trash ever produced. I used it at my 25th birthday. Everyone loved it. As much as everyone loves me. This piece of music, quite simply, eradicates the difference between good and bad music, between a glorious emotional experience and acoustic terror. I love it. Well, at least everyone should admit that the composition is far more complex and interesting than most of what they play on the radio these days...or do you think there's anything 'interesting' about Britney Spears?"
__label__1,"Wrong ingredients: This product is unscented, but that's all that's right about it.The listed ingredients are different than what is actually in the bottle. The main difference is that the shampoo contains the harsh cleanser sodium myreth sulfate, which damages the hair and scalp. This was not listed under the ingredients."
__label__2,"be careful: I purchased these filters with the understanding they had the black filter on one side, when in fact they did not.

__label__2,"Man this is awesome!: The first time I listened to this I didn't really like. By the third time I realized its better than Brave New World. Now on the 8th or 9th listen i'm starting to wonder if this isn't the best Maiden album ever! I just love this stuff that grows on you the more you listen to it... haven't heard anything like this in a LONG time. Wildest Dreams is the weakest song and I haven't really gotten into Rainmaker yet but the rest is so awesome! My favorite is Face In the Sand but I don't know if that'll last, paschendale, journeyman, montsegur, dance of death... man they all rule!!!"
__label__1,"Not a good example of Gregorian Chant: Having studied and sung chant for several years, I would not recommend this CD. Although Gregorian Chant can be a rather interpretive style of singing, this is by far one of the more unusual interpretations I have encountered. It throws most of the rules of chant out the window regarding pace. This is clearly a CD for a performance and not a Chant for prayer or meditation. The only way I can describe it is ""bouncy,"" which completely ruins the sanctity of the music."
__label__2,"A Very Enjoyable 2+-Hour Collection: If you dont know anythin about the duo of Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell, collectively known as Air Supply, well here's your chance! Forever Love is a 36-song collection of their most cherished ballads, plus a whole lot more!I've been a fan of air Supply since i was a kid and i have all except 2 of their albums (thos released in the 70's). there's really no substitute to hearing ALL of the songs they've put on their albums throughout all these years but buying this is a start. overall, although i personally would have changed around 6 songs from the line-up in this collection, FOREVER LOVE makes for a very enjoyable 2+ hours of listening."

__label__1,"Not worth the money: Logitech 980158-0403 Internet Chat HeadsetI feel very dissapointed about the product. The mic does not pick up your voice the way it shoud, maybe because when you put the headset on the mic is too far from the mouth.One more thing, the headset fits loose. No matter in what possititon you put it, will always feel loose unless you wear a dreadlocks wig.This is the first item I provide a feedback about and I've been buying for quite some time. don't buy this."
__label__2,"Great death metal!!: I can strongly suggest picking anything up by this band. This is their first cd and although primitive by their standards, this still blows away most other death metal. Nice, melodic, heavy guitars with a growling voice. If you like early entombed, carcass, dismember and stuff like this you will love hypocrisy."
__label__2,good compilation: there are some real cool party cuts on here for the occasion and these songs actual blend real well through the various time periods and compliment one another. i enjoyed the songs picked.
__label__1,"Disappointed: I was disappointed in this book. It doesn't contain much information on making flowers or figures, and much of what is in the book is elementary. It seems more like an advertisement for Winbeckler's other products than a tutorial."
__label__1,"Too bulky and stiff: This is a good joystick if you like to play with the controller on a desk. But I like to hold the controller in my lap. The base is too thick to be held comfortably. My left hand gets sore almost immediately. Also, the rubber rings around the stick make the resistance too high especially if you hold the base in your lap. Also, the buttons aren't badly positioned but I still prefer the layout for buttons on the Gravis Blackhawk. The Thrustmaster forces me to use a pinky finger for button number four. I prefer the Blackhawk because I can use a finger on my other hand for the fourth button. The only thing I like about the Thrustmaster when compared to the Blackhawk is the inclusion of a Point of View hat."

__label__1,Over the door Hook in Black: I'm not very happy with it because I wasn't aware that it was for a thick door and my door is not as thick so I had to adjust it but it doesn't look the way it's supposed to look. I feel that the seller should have stated that it was for a thick door.
__label__1,"Not good for Volvo 1800: This book is not a good book for the Volvo 1800 series. Sure, it has some mechanical and electrical information, but VERY LITTLE other than what overlaps the 120 and 130. It appears to me that Haynes added a few paragraphs (and I mean literally a few) just so they could put ""plus P1800"" on the cover.I was extremely disappointed in the lack of specific 1800 series diagrams and info.Definately would NOT make this purchase again."
__label__2,"thought-provoking: a good, quick read to illustrate some important principles to consider in leading an organization. would recommend to any leader or aspiring leader."
__label__1,"Broke after 2 months: I liked that the tie rack held so many ties. It made it easy to be organized. I wasn't crazy about how slow the rack revolved or how much noise it made, but I figured I could live with it because it held so much. Unfortunately after 2 months of use, the plastic fell apart while revolving. The plastic tabs on the top piece that clip into the bottom cracked from the vibration. The ties ended up in a jumbled mess on the floor and the rack cannot be repaired. For the price it should have lasted longer."
__label__1,"Ouch!: This book is very thorough, very detailed, and massive overkill for any rational use. I just designed my first vehicle with it, and it took me most of a hour and I'm pretty sure I have missed a lot of the rules.For example: You are going through the vehicle design checklist, and you come to the step where you have to buy a powerplant (page 36). They are rated in KW of energy. How many KW do you need? It doesn't say. Searching the book, I find a formula to estimate in a sidebar on page 22, but the heading claims it is ""optional"" so I assume there is some other rule somewhere else. Page 61 has tables to calculate ""Thrust factor"" and ""power factor,"" but does not explain why you would want to know these numbers.If you enjoy idling away the hours designing vehicles, this book is probably for you. If you want to quickly design some vehicles for a campaign, you are going to be frustrated."
__label__1,NO GOOD: This device only lasted 4 months being used only once a day and that wasn't even every day. Now it is DEAD. No steam. Cold espresso. Called customer service and left a message 2 days ago and still no response. This is a piece of crap machine.
__label__1,"The Boss Needs Protection: ""Protect the boss"" is the 200th remake of ""a poor good girl meets a super-rich unruly immature guy + love triangle + disapproving parents + rich people fight over money"" drama. There is absolutely no twist or surprise element in the story. In the first few episodes where feisty Che Gang-Hi and immature Ji Son butt heads there are some actions, but soon after it becomes just another melodrama that tries to be clever with criticism of Korean super-riches. Actually there is a scene where Ji Son tells Che Gang-Hi ""you used to be so attractive because you were so feisty, but now you are boring. I want the old feisty you back"" and that is exactly how it feels. Toward the end the only funny scenes are by Wang Ji-Hye. She plays a rich girl who is an enemy of Che Gang-Hi early, but she turns into a lovable ditz.It is for the fans of the actors or soap operas, and if you are looking for a new story with a lot of twists and multiple layers, this is not it."
__label__2,"An excellent buy: I'll add my five cents to the generally very favourable reviews here. I've had the XT1 speaker system for three months now, and carried it all around the Americas with me. It packs up nicely in the carrying case, plugs in with no fuss, and the sound is amazing for such a small unit -- clean and clear, and easily filling an ordinary-sized room. I also use them as my standard laptop speakers at home -- while they don't rattle the walls like some of Altec Lansing's larger bass-heavy units, they also connect directly to the USB port, so they don't have the terribly annoying static buzz and interference of many cheaper Altec systems that plug into the wall. One of the nicest computer accessories I've ever bought."
__label__2,"La Fleming Dazzles: The reviews that I have read regarding this release seem to be cut right down the middle between Fleming die-hards and opera lovers who don't like her. I am of the former, especially after having seen Ms Fleming live. The album will not disappoint, especially the selections from Maria Padilla, Il Pirata and Lucrezia Borgia. We should be applauding Ms Fleming's ability to take risks and rise above the flack she is getting. Bravo Renee, I look forward to your next release with great enthusiasm!"
__label__2,"A spectacular read dah-lin'!: This is a book about the bonds that can tie imperfect people together and make them stronger. Vivid description and at times very funny but also very touching- especially if you've lived in the South-- or have a mother! The characters and their adventures are memorable; it's one of those books you read over and over. Far superior to ""Little Altars Everywhere"", the book this is a sequel to. Rebecca Wells obviously matured as a writer after writing Little Altars, which does not have to be read to understand this book (in fact I would say don't read it at all, just enjoy Divine Secrets). Divine Secrets is bound to be a favorite book passed from mother to daughter-- or in my case daughter to mother! Enjoy!"

__label__1,"Not what I expect from Spanx.: I carefully chose the correct size as shown on the chart. These ""power panties"" didn't hold in anything more than regular underwear. Also the top kept rolling down. very uncomfortable. I can't return them because I wore them or they would be going back. A total waste of $30. Very disappointed. The second star is because the fabric was light and unfortunately too freeing."
__label__1,"Cheaply Made: I was really excited about this bike. It was easy to put together, and seems to do okay, other than the fact that the calorie counter monitor falls off easily, and within ten minutes of using it, it fell off and the wires came completely out. It had been super glued. Now I have no way of counting calories/distance/etc. Buy a more expensive one."
__label__2,We LOVE Whoozit!: We have purchased 2 Whoozits - one for my first son and one for our second (the first one was still in good shape but had to replaced once my 3-year-old dropped it in the toilet!).Both of my sons loved this toy as infants. The bright colors and different shaped arms are very intriguing. I use mine hung above the car seat. It keeps my little one entertained much better than his carseat toy ever did. We are BIG Whoozit fans. :)

I can easily describe these speakers in one word....incredible.When you hear them, you will want them. You will do like I did....found a way to get the money together to buy a pair. If I could afford them, I would build an audio room and have a pair of Klipschorns in the corners. Best speakers in the world, in my opinion."

Imagine, a man who is in the Country Music Hall of Fame, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Song Writers Hall of Fame. Can't say ANYTHING good about the disk. The sound quality is not there at all. The picture quality is not there either. I think the general idea of the presentation might be ok, they just missed the mark. In years to come, I hope someone doesn't come across THIS disk and wonder how the guy depicted could have received so many awards. Leave this disk at the supplier and get the George Jones instead."

Watching a blank TV screen would have been more enjoyable. I am, unfortunately, one of those people who has to read an entire book, never walks out on a movie and keeps living in hope that the plot will suddenly develop and this piece of tripe will make sense! It doesn't happen.I don't have any idea who the people are that were in this movie (I refuse to call them ""actors""), but their next jobs should involve something that would improve upon their acting skills - Wal-Mart greeter comes to mind. On second thought, please, let them go back to community college and find something they actually have talent to do."

My life...: I got a copy of Matchbook at a book signing party and after scanning the room of beautiful, successful and interesting 20- 30 somethings, I was dying to read this book! I stayed up most of the night reading and couldn't stop smiling! I was able to totally identify and couldn't stop wondering....did i know these ""desperados""??? Did I date Mr. Married Single? I definitely knew Miss Gold Digger! Dating in NYC is quite an interesting & all too often comical challenge...all of my frends have their endless stories that we always said should be in a book. Finally, I found a book where our stories actually exist!"
__label__2,"Best book I've read since Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"": It's been a long time since I've picked up a book that could hold my interest as Ayn Rand's novels did for me back in the early 80s. Unintened Consequences by John Ross has managed to do just that. I've lived through and recall many of the actual historical events chronicled in his novel, but they all happened over a period of many years. As a member of the gun culture and a licensed private pilot (yes, it's more than just gun control... FAA abuses are also expounded upon, as well as abuses by other alphabet soup agencies) I've followed these events with a keen interest, but getting bombarded with these events compressed into the one week time period it took me to read the novel had a chilling effect. Our birthright is being stolen from us, and this book should be a wake up call to everyone who values their freedoms."

__label__2,"Musical Heroin: If I could, I would give this album less then 5 stars for being too addictive. Just try listening to the last 3 minutes of ""Take Pills"", any of the glorious ""Bros"", or ""Good Girl/Carrots"" without having them stuck in your head for the rest of the day. My grades have slipped because of Panda Bear's melodies echoing in my cranium, the neighbors have considered evicting me for overuse of the phrase ""Hey man what's your problem"" and don't even get me started on my communication skills at work...But I can't give this less then 5 Stars, I just love it too much. Like Jennifer Connelly in Requiem For a Dream, I go to sleep with my person pitch everynight, I think I got off a little bit easier then her though. I recommend this album like Whitney Houston would secretly recommend crack: You have to try it, but make sure you don't have anything else planned. It'll keep you hooked for a while."
__label__1,Can't review due to poor mail service: I can't review this product due to the fact that you NEVER delivered it to my address and it was returned to your stores.I doubt if I will perform any further purchases from your site.
__label__2,Alex's book review: I like like this book because it is very exciting especially when the Hardy Boys got locked in the water tower and they found the treasure. I also liked when they fell through the trap door. I like all the Hardy Boy's books and this is my favorite! It's Neal's favorite too!
__label__1,Threw it away while it was still working: Makes more noise than it actually sucksHair still goes all over the floor
__label__2,"Beautiful Teapot: I wanted to purchase this Villeroy & Boch Garden Fleurence teapot, it matches the rest of my china, but it was outragiously priced at Macy's and Bloomingdales. ecom gave me a terrific price and quick shipping. I'm so happy with it!"
__label__2,Pretty Good: I like the product but not as good as the other brand... Love the price! The smell is great but it does seem to run a little thin. I've only used it as a body wash and facial cleanser and it works fine. Not sure how it does in laundry or on your dishes.
__label__2,"Reasonably Gentle Introduction to Celestial Mechanics: I liked this book -- particularly the first half. In the first half, the author makes a very accessible presentation of Kepler's laws. The line of reasoning is clear and quite self-contained. This really is the first presentation of Kepler's calculations that I have seen that is accessible for the scientifically-inclined layman. The author also does a nice job with Newton's work (some knowledge of calculus concepts would help here). The later half of the book tries to present perturbation theory. While interesting, the arguments are less rigorous and more conceptual. The author also takes a very brief look at Earth satellites (very new at the time of publication - 1959) and Einstein's work (very cursory).The book does require that the reader have a working knowledge of algebra. A little high school physics would also help. Some calculus background would help when going through the material in the appendix."
__label__1,"cheap quality: I had this watch for two weeks and the metal band broke. in addition sometimes the button that controls the indiglo gets ""locked "" in the on position"
__label__2,"OBSCURE HISTORIES OF SS UNITS REVEALED: THIS OFFERING FROM AXIS EUROPA BOOKS AND ANTONIO MUNOZ SHOWS A LOT OF RESEARCH INTO A NUMBER OF OBSCURE SS UNITS. THE BOOK IS BASICLY WELL WRITTEN ALTHOUGH MR.MUNOZ HAS A TENDENCY TO DIGRESS INTO MATERIAL THAT PERHAPS SHOULD'VE BEEN ENTERED IN THE TEXT AS A FOOTNOTE. THIS SOMETIMES INTERFERES WITH THE FLOW OF THE NARRATIVE; STILL YOU WON'T FIND THESE UNITS DEALT WITH BY ANY OTHER AUTHORS TO THE SAME EXTENT. THE BOOK WAS A GOOD READ, AND I RECOMMEND IT."
__label__2,All Joe Scruggs: I am 14 years old and still love listening to this guy. I have been listening to him for as long as I can remember.
__label__1,"incredible price but: Easy to order,quick delivery, and incredibly cheap price ($.48) plus shipping but it did not improve the signal (it actually made it worse) to my tv so I resorted to using my old RCA only cable from my VCR to TV. Oh well it may be useful for something else in the future."
__label__2,"Very helpful and easy to understand.: I am the first time coach of a second grade boys soccer team. This book was very easy to understand for the kids as well as myself. For kids that are relatively new to the game it explains positions, the different kinds of kicks and the all around basics of soccer without getting too technical. It has been a great aid for our team."
__label__1,"Possible quality control problem: Received this filter with 2 little silver dots on the surface. Had to return it immediately back to ecom. For some reason ecom did not offer replacement. I'll order another one from hopefully it will work this time.The 58mm filter I purchased together was received in good condition, though."
__label__1,"Don't waste your money or your time: This was the worst excuse for comedy I have ever seen. A very amateurish production. The jokes were lame, the pace was slow and painful. A tremendous disappointment!"
__label__2,"A Sure Thing!: The one sure thing is that ""Soul Voyage"" is one of the only CD's I have that I can listen to again and again and never get tired of it. ""Stop the Rain"" brings tears to the eyes and yet other songs on the album have a great rock sound. Being a rocker at heart, I love Erich's licks on the guitar. His clear and crisp sound is candy for the ears. You won't stop tapping your feet to this one and seeing them live is even more of a treat. You won't be disappointed. Buy it and visit their website Goodfortuneband.com, believe me, you will not regret it!"
__label__1,Not worth the money: The differentiating feature of this watch is the compass function. It simply does not work - not even close. In addition the watchband poorly designed - very uncomfortable and difficult to use.
__label__1,"Not what I expected...: The reason I got this book for Kindle was because the reviews said it was laugh out loud funny. I needed a good laugh! However, half way through I thought ""this is truly tragic"". Cybill is honest and forthright which is admirable in a bio. The content is truly tragic, although she tries to mask it with humor. Sort of like J.D. Salinger in ""Catcher in the Rye"". Funny, but really sad at the same time. I'm glad Cybill had no regrets, but what a rough road she took in life. Actually, now that I'm more than halfway through, I may just stop reading. So I guess I wouldn't recommend it. It's starting to bore and irritate me."
__label__1,"Awful!: I guess I shouldn't have expected so much from a book that is completely out of date. I had to skip through many pages just to get to something that wouldn't confuse me. I'm a new mom. I can't think straight, let alone count out all my calories, categorize them into food groups, AND find the time to eat 2700 calories a day! She recommends the amount of calories for an average woman to MAINTAIN her weight, plus the calories it takes to breastfeed your baby. I don't see how youre supposed to lose weight on a diet that is recommended for maintaining weight. It's also very discouraging to hear that you're not going to lose any more than a pound (or two) per month. I actually know how to eat a healthy diet, so this book didn't bring any other revelation. Also, she never really clarifies whether something you eat is bad or good, or whether excercise is recommened or not. She seems to recommend one thing, then point out some article, book, or study that says otherwise."
__label__2,"good raw food: my first experience being raw. pretty good for raw. filling and not low-fat, but still feels healthy. just satisfies. not delicious but enjoyable for good food. good on-th-go. very sweet because of the dates but not chocolate-y."
__label__2,Nice little one!: I like this kettle. It gets the job done pretty fast. The only drawback is that it cannot hold much water.
__label__2,"Excellent for Pet Grooming: I purchased this based on other reviews, and have found that it is perfect for pet grooming. We had a Greyhound, just passed away in January of 07, and his nails were very hard to clip, so I purchased this and used the very fine grinder barrel and his nails were done so quickly.He barely flinched and his nails looked really nice."
__label__1,"Stick to other labels' soundtrack comps: ...It sounds like someone held a microphone next to a television set. The music selection is interestng and amusing, and the package is nice enough.The track details are sparse. Some tracks identify film titles; some do not, and there is no composer or musician or producer informationThere is a real need for a better version of an album like this...As for this, get it if you really don't care about audio quality. I usually DON'T, actually, but this album still bothers me. I'm sure it will bother a serious soundtrack album collector much more."
__label__2,Nice alternative to those new gas cans: Everyone seems to hate the new safety standards on the gas cans and this is a nice alternative. Sure 14.x gallons (based on recommended max fill) is a lot to move if you need to move it around but two people can easily lift it onto a shelf. This allows filling into whatever you need. I use it to fill my ATV and one gallon cans where I mix with oil for saws and trimmer. No more spills all over the ATV or garage floor!For some reason my box didn't have have the nozzle (I think it fell out in shipping because the box top was open a little). The manufacture said they were on back order but took my shipping info. A couple weeks later I got the nozzle. Talk about fantastic service!If you compare the price of this vs. three 5 gallon containers the cost is not much more and you have much better tank with a less stressful experience! :D
__label__1,"Gosh, who needs ethics anyway?: Hey - I know - first - make a bunch of money and piss a bunch of people offby spamming the internet. Then make more money selling a book telling othersthis is a great idea."
__label__1,Cover gives it away (mostly): If you read the back cover of this book then you basically know what is going to happen . However the advertised third force is a furphy and is unsatisfactorily set aside . This author has regurgitated the tired Freeman and his delta/sas team formula . The only difference is that the scenario is on a smaller scale compared to previous titles .Unfortunately the author seems have to have retained his desire to introduce sexual liasions of ludicrous and unecesary proportions into his books (Hint: Freeman scores) . This wastes time that could have been spent developing the tissue thin plot and characters.In summary: save your money and buy a proper special forces techno thriller .
__label__2,Both alluring and captivating: Prolific performing artist Paul O'Dette continues to delight and surprise us with these compositions of another time and place. Both alluring and captivating.Rated four and a half to five stars.Ken Cybulska
__label__2,"Love This Book!!!: Before reading this book, I was unaware that Bragg Organic ACV had so many natural healing properties. But Bragg ACV is an incredible natural healing agent. Based on the info in this book and using the Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar I have healed an eye infection, lost weight, alleviated a sore throat, relieved congestion. The book discusses so many uses for this incredible product that instead of going to WEB MD, I now consult this book for a natural healing remedy first. It's also great in a salad dressing! I have two large bottles in my pantry--one for healing remedies and one for salads. Great product and great book!"
__label__1,"Not very availaing!: I had purchased this book as a reference for sacred space consultations, in particular with blessings and personal healing. I have since returned this book as I found it not very inspiring nor powerful in its wording. I do not feel that I am speaking to God but rather just reciting meaningless mantras."
__label__2,"Most underated J Geils album: Without a doubt, this album is the real sleeper of the J Geils legacy. Seth Justman absolutely dominates on this CD, with many of the songs being written around his superb keyboard work. The sound quality on this 1973 release is also top notch. Although the topic of many of the songs is women and love, Peter Wolf injects his traditional raspy vocals that lift many of the songs to great heights. ""Lay your good thing down"", a not-so-subtle reference to doing the wild thing is a perfect example. If you're a true Geils fan, and if like me you had a chance to catch one of their amazing comeback shows during the summer of '99, do yourself a favor and check this album out. It belongs in your collection."
__label__1,"Lackluster Performance: If you like Black Uhuru, you will be disappointed by this lackluster performance and minimalist musical arrangements."
__label__2,"Great Product, however falsely advertised-this product is Not an aromatherapy neck pillow~: The fabric on this neck pillow is great. It is very masculine- black satin with gold dragons. It is beautiful though. The only thing I was disappointed about was the lack of scent. It was advertised as an Aromatherpay Neck Roll and is not an aromatherapy neck roll. Otherwise it is great."
__label__1,"For as long as it lasted: It was a great grinder as long as it lasted. I used a couple of weeks and the stationary handle snapped off. It still works if I hold the ball and move the brind handle, but I'll be looking for a new grinder."
__label__2,Seinfeld-Season 7: My son is collecting Seinfeld and asks for these on his birthdays andChristmas holidays so I give them to him. He is a young adult. I toofind the program funny and enjoy the extra features on the DVD.
__label__1,"Awful!: First I should disclose that I didn't finish this book. I got about halfway through before I couldn't take it anymore. I love BDSM erotica, and I often enjoy stories with non-consensual things such as this one--kidnapping and such. So prudishness is not the reason I disliked this book. It was just terrible...not erotic or sexy to me at all. There is no erotic energy between Deborah and any of the men, and they weren't interesting or sexy characters at all. The dialogue basically consists of ""On your knees bitch"", ""Suck it bitch"", ""I'm gonna put you in a cage bitch"". Seriously, it was that bad. I wouldn't recommend this, it's just not hot at all!"
__label__1,"Worked in the house but not in the yard: This worked fine in my house, however when I moved it outside (within the 25 ft advertised of the trees my dogs bark up because of squirrels) it has not worked at all."
__label__2,"5 STARS FOR SISSEL, 3 STARS FOR SONGS, AVERAGE=4 STARS!: Having been introduced to Sissel's gorgeous angelic voice through the soundtrack of TITANIC, I could not wait for her long overdue US release and what a treat it is overall!! Her voice is so soothing, captivating, clear, gorgeous.....she can sing anything to me and I would be impressed by HER VOICE! However, some of the songs on this album do not do her justice....but the standout awesome tracks are CAN'T GO BACK, ALL GOOD THINGS, WE BOTH KNOW, CARRIER OF A SECRET, SOLITAIRE and SHOULD IT MATTER.....the others while good are not as stellar as these! Buy this cd though and be swept away into the world of SISSEL!"
__label__2,"The Southern Vampire Series...: ....is a HOOT!!! You gotta love any series that has Elvis as a Vampire named ""Bubba""...But shhhhh. He doesn't know he was Elvis. Read the series... and enjoy!!!"
__label__2,"Game changer (pun intended!) in the classroom . . .: I love that the games are offered within categories--that helps me find something on the fly. Also, my students have gotten familiar with the book and I sometimes have one of them choose what we'll play ""next"" time! There are great games for all age groups. I teach high school, so I worried about whether or not my kids would turn up their noses at the games included; but there are so many from which to choose, that hasn't been a problem at all. The kids are so excited to be out of their seats doing something, they don't care if I pick a more elementary game once in a while. The favorite so far has been group juggling. Beware - it gets LOUD! :)"
__label__2,"Great price. Great product.: I purchased this product for 2 mountain bikes that I needed to keep inside my rental apartment, without doing damage to the walls or ceiling. Works great so far. It is large enough to hold 2 full size mountain bikes and sturdy enough so that you feel confident nothing will come crashing down in the middle of the night. I would recommend bracing it against a ceiling beam however, for extra security. My only small complaint is that after removing the front tires so that the front handlebars would lie flat against the wall, the bikes are difficult to balance. The tightening screw that is supposed to control the level of the bikes once they are affixed to the bar does not work at all. It was a balancing act, but I was able to get them to work in the end, even with 1 tire off.There was one reviewer who said that you cannot attach 2 bikes, but that is not the case. 2 Bikes easily fit and hold up well.Overall, a great product and a good price."
__label__2,"Good List of Job Descriptions: If you have ever worked in a resteraunt before, then most of the first half or so of this book will be a little boring. There were some helpful hints here and there, but a lot of the broad concepts I already knew. For example, dating co-workers can lead to problems, work fast but don't get careless, etc.The part of this work that was really useful for me was the job descriptions. I did some searching on the Internet and could find a list that is as good as this book. There are listings for every position that I have heard of and there are descriptions of the job conditions and skills required for the job and (most important to me) standard pay."
__label__2,"Great Multi Task Spatula: Although I felt the price of the Wusthof spatula was inflated,the quality was great! I have gone through many different spatulas over the years,as my overflowing utensil drawer can attest,before finally finding THE ONE!!!I am now finished my search and can empty my stash knowing this will serve all purposes!!"
__label__2,The Price is Right: The quality is not that great but coming from the 80's I don't expect much more. I'd have loved to get a much better package with chapter descriptions and other info but I still gave it 4 stars because of the price. I'm not sure I'd have paid more for a better packaging on this particular show. Bottom line I'm happy with the product and price.
__label__1,"Wrong picture for the pillow I got: I ordered this pillow for my sons room and I got a TOTALLY different pillow. One would assume that the pictured pillow was what I would be getting. Instead I got a pillow with a ""shadow"" of Anakin and Obie Wan duelling. It's an okay pillow but a HUGE dissapointment since my son was expecting the pictured one. I would be careful from purchasing from Target on ecom."
__label__2,"CAVU- Clear and Visibility Unlimited: Not being much of a tennis player, but being an avid golfer, the parallels of how to approach your opponent by being either the executioner or the ultimate warrior made a lot of sense. I particularly digested the statement of ""I don't ask for the tools to win, only the tools to fight, and I can handle the rest"". This has motivated me to call upon my skills at hand as my desire to succeed gains momentum throughout the match. This a great read."
__label__2,"Incredibly Beautiful Content: ""Inspirational Wisdom For Love, Beauty, And Richness""is a book of incredible beautiful content. If this typeof wisdom were practiced by more and more people, thiscould change the world in a very positive way. Enjoyedthe book very much. Read it all in one night."
__label__2,"My children love it, but complain it is not up to date.: This junior dictionary is ideal for 8 to 12 years old kids, ithas everything they need at that age. The dictionary is built in sucha colorfull way that is easy for them to find the words and their different meanings with examples, homographs, homophones, idioms and inflected forms. Pronunciation keys are presented at the botton of every right hand page. A new edition is required to update the new countries and world map. The price is a real bargain."
__label__2,"Excellent Energy: I am a relatively new fan of techno and I must say that I find BT to be consistent and energetic. The thing that attracted me to techno to begin with is the complexity of rythym bound together in one presentation. BT does this beautifully, and the first time I listened to ""Godspeed"" I had goosebumps. BT drew me into this world, as he was the first artist I was introduced to. I have just purchased two of his other works, R&R and ESCM and will review those later. For anyone who is looking to get into techno, I recommend BT. Warning: Do not listen to over and over again, like the NC gent mentioned. It is true. It's like a great movie, you wish you hadn't seen it already so you can enjoy it for the first time all over again."
__label__2,"Leamer is the best non-fiction writer in America: I read this book several years ago in hardback, which I loaned to someone who never returned it. When I saw it in a bookstore in paperback, I just had to buy and read it again. Ascent is better than Into Thin Air. It's a fabulous story--not only an adventure classic but a philosophical manifesto, dealing with the whole idea of placing one's life at risk while striving to reach a particular goal. This is one you have to read!"
__label__1,"This Movie is Typical Garbage: i just watched this movie tonight, how the hell does this movie have a 4 star average?? must be a lot of 10 year olds giving reviews for this movie. has anyone else been feeling that entertainment for many years now (movies & music) has been seriously lacking? just about everything is the same ol' standard, reproduced, cookie cutter garbage. this is what we have here with national treasure.some might say who cares if it isn't a great movie its just silly fun. the problem with that is the silliness doesn't work for this movie because it tries to take its plotline seriously and believable. everything about this movie was so standard it could make you puke. average acting performances, typically cheesy action movie dialogue, geeky comic relief sidekick who isn't funny, token romance on the side, predictable plot turns...someone give me the barf bag. i can only recommend this movie to those who enjoy ""fun"" action movies while being in a state of comatose...or ten year olds."

__label__1,not what I hoped: I purchased this for my mother who has macular degeneration and has difficulty seeing. This was nothing more than a piece of plastic that somewhat magnified but it was very unclear and not helpful at all for her.
__label__2,"Excellent Movie, and A Sountrack To Supplement: If you liked the Movie, you'll enjoy the pictures and memories of the movie this CD brings back. It is a SOUNDTRACK, so don't expect much more than the Backround music you saw in the movie, but if your looking for that, it's here and GOOD too. The last Four Songs are good as well, one of the main reasons I bought it, plus I enjoy the main Theme Music of the movie. A good buy if you want backround music and some new sounds in music."
__label__2,"An entertaining, rare historical addition to the series: Gareth Roberts provides us with another good story, his penultimate Missing Adventure, and a historical at that! This rare gem will entertain fans of the Doctor and students of the 17th century alike, but will be most reminiscent to serious appreciators of the Doctor of Donald Cotton's riotous retellings of history in the old Hartnell stories ""The Romans"" and ""The Myth Makers"". Just who is the Spaniard, and why does he want to bring down the throne of England"
__label__2,"This CD is a must have!!!: I am a LONG time Patti LaBelle fan. When I purchased the CD, I wasn't too blown away by her choices for songs to remake. But that soon changed after listening to it. Patti makes each of these songs her own. This has to be Patti's best CD ever. The songs are so soulful and that voice...what more can I say about that voice? Patti does not skip a beat. It's been a long time since I've bought a CD and LOVED each and every song. I smell some Grammys for Miss Patti."
__label__1,"not bad: I've had this product for over a year. The lights worked great for occasional use, but are VERY HOT, producing a lot of heat, but also a lot of light. Sadly, they both stopped working at the same time. Replacing bulbs didn't solve the problem. Obviously, poor quality/wiring. Useless now..."
__label__2,Nice belt for the price.: A few too many pockets but a nice pouch for the price. Great belt. Needs bigger nail pouch however.
__label__1,"Not what I was looking for.: For $20, I was not going to get a great binocs. This one came even below that expectation. It is very difficult to focus on any object with this."
__label__2,Great Item: The Toro Blower/Vac is great. The power is just right for either blowing leaves and grass or vacuuming. A high quality product.
__label__2,"A true gem that stands the test of time...: A couple of years after hearing this record for the first time I still find it fresh, innovative and simply enjoyable. Although not free of imperfections, Furtado's first album is a bold statement by a mainstreem artist who is not afraid to go in her own direction. I instantly got hooked on songs like ""On the radio"", ""Legend"", ""Party"" and the beautiful ""Scared of you"". And ""Turn off the light"" is the best song I've ever heard on a pop record - you just can't get enough of it!"
__label__2,"WOW of a novel! Hot and poetic and very Latin!: Novas' poetic writing is amazing. The characters are each gems, even the sinister ones. Santeria, Judaism, Cuban_American mishegas: This story has it all. The sensitive way the author dealt with the transexual character is unique and inspiring. In fact, the whole novel is an inspiration, written by one of America's truly masterful writers."
__label__2,"Additional Info: The book is a wonderful replication of the original from 1905 that I, too, have. I am glad it has been reproduced. It is the story of ""Silverlocks"" and the 3 Bears. When did she become ""Goldilocks? Did it happen when ""Goldenbooks"" began to print the story? Does anyone know?"
__label__1,"It's a video lecture: For a budding herbalist, this is a good video for initial information and current medicinal opinions in the natural healing community. The author is interviewed and gives his opinions and ideas, but there is no instruction or guides for making your own healing herbal concoctions. If you are just starting out, it is worth seeing but becomes tedious after a while and the video is rather primative in production. Still, good information on the holistic point of view, but nothing else."
__label__1,"I get indigestion... thinking about Joy Electic... too much.: I am just curious as to why this band is depicted as Christian? What is this about ""being my munchkin in Joy Electric"" land? Is Joy Electric supposed to symbolize the synthesis of artificial emotions characterizing contemporary worship? These lyrics are beyond reproach. I'm not sure who the composer was, but they definately deserve to be caned publicly for such a heinous rendering of potentially inspirational music. That's just my two cents, and my two stars. Thanks for a good laugh!!!"
__label__1,"Beginning of the end for Adult Swim?: Absolutely horrible. If this and the Loiter Squad are the type of shows the network think are worth showing, they're in serious trouble..."
__label__2,works very well: I've been running this pump for 2 months now in a 15 gallon tank pushing a 12 inch air stone and a 3 inch air disc and it's always worked adequately. It pushes more bubbles than I really need so I actually use in-line air valves to slow the bubbles down. I actually bought a second one for my two small tanks.
__label__1,"Do not buy!!!: The main 52 card deck back was GREEN. The 10 ""extra"" cards, packed separately, were BLUE! The normally red hearts and diamonds were green in the 52 card deck. Who would play with these unless you are color blind? Now, to try getting my money back."
__label__1,"Overrated and Understated: I was expected a heck of a lot more interesting, unique and contemporary ideas. But all I got was the same stuff that is in all the other wedding books I've seen."
__label__1,"Need a reality check: I work in the field of abused children. I felt this book did not hold the women accountable for their actions. The author's basically gave them a ""free pass"" in life by making excuses. It does not matter if you are rich, poor, abused....you took a life ( a very innocent life that could not protect him or herself ).In addition, they did not go into enough detail with the stories they presented. Basically, they gave a few lines regarding a case, and that was it. I think it would have been better to have spent more time on a few cases including all of the history."
__label__2,"Another Ozark Classic: With Don't Look Down The Ozarks released another classic album in 1977. This is once again country/pop rock at it's very best.Any album with a song like ""Giving it all to the wind"" on it is a classic. Everytime friends of mine who don't know The Ozarks hear this beautiful Larry Lee song they are completely blown away by it. The rest of the songs are far above standard country rock quality. Why these guys weren't as popular like The Eagles is still one of the great mysteries of the 70's !! There are 3 bonus tracks on this cd version: ""Sweetwood"" is one of them and is one of the best ballads ever to have been released by The Ozarks. Talking about quality control.......this track was never released until now !!So once again.........go out and buy this album !!!PS; Some more good news; The CBS album from 1980 will als be released by the good people of New Era in november 2005 !Greetings to all Ozark fans,Martin from Holland"
__label__2,"Absolutely fantastic movie!!!!!: Loved the movie, wished that I went to see it in theaters would have been worth every dollar. I wish everyone could see this movie, so they could understand what the people in the military sacrifice every day for our protection."
__label__1,"Falls off a cliff...: The part on Front Screen Projection to fake the moon landing was plausible, but everything else is completely false when it comes to ""The Shining"" the maker of this film should of done some research, because at the very end of the film they show the final shot of ""The Shining"" and the narrator says ""you want to know what that secret paper in jacks hand says, you just did"" The photo wasn't created for the movie, it was a stock photo that they put Jack Nicholson's head onto, thus killing the little credibility the filmmaker had."
__label__2,Reasonably Priced Replacement: This is the exact same battery that Palm installs in the Treo when you purchase it. The cost is significantly less than purchasing from Palm. I have not had any problems with the battery since I installed it.
__label__2,"Breathtakingly beautiful music definitely from Eden!!: I enjoy Celtic music a lot, so I was very pleased to hear this release from Eden's Bridge. The style is distinctively their own, with flavors of jazz, folk, and light rock, but still VERY Celtic to the core. Sarah Lacy's haunting vocal stylings seem a mix of Enya, Sheila Walsh, and even Madonna. This is a fantastic CD to listen to when stressed out or just needing a break, though it's got enough punch on some tracks to get one energized for the day. Any fan of Celtic music will enjoy this album thoroughly!!!"
__label__1,"Poor Crafmanship: I collect chess sets and thought this one looked unique. The set arrived promptly and was well-packaged. However, after unwrapping a few pieces, I saw that they were very sloppily made and the painting looked like that of a small child. The quality was unbelieveably poor. The set was returned for credit, minus my shipping costs."

__label__2,Sidekicks Movie: Do not consider Sidekicks a poor mans Karate Kid. It is a unique movie that is great for the whole family. A few mild vulgarities/ nothing worse than what your first grader would hear on the bus on his/her way to school. Chuck Norris plays a compelling role here and the kid is pretty good too. Don't look for this title on DVD by the way- was only released on VHS.
__label__2,What a perfect Stocking Stuffer!: This book made me laugh. In fact I am going to buy it foreveryone I know.
__label__2,"Bringing Holistic Awareness to the community: I thought that the documentary had a very urban approach.Using a practicing holistic wellness consultant that alsois an MC gives the documentary a sincer feel. Super NovaSpeaks from the heart, which is hard to find in this error of hip-hop.Everyone that was interviewed had something profound tosay about holistic wellness and how it can affect the community.Overall I think that this film will be scrutinized because of theSubject mater and because it is the first of its kind...It's a great learning tool and my children love to watch it."
__label__2,"Farouk hair dryer: I love how quiet it is, and the ceramic makes it seem cooler. It does seem to take a little longer to dry my hair than it did with my previous dryer."
__label__2,"Great Product, shipping was slower than expected.: This products fits my Treo 700wx very nicely and offers great protection. I was concerned when I first opened the package, as the packaging advertised that the item was for the Treo 650. I believe this was a mistake, as it fits nicely. I actually had to take it on and off a couple of times and it still seems to fit nicely, despite some other comments about the item stretching out as a result of puttin on/taking off. Product was delivered a couple days after the date promised."
__label__2,The High Road Of Faith A Personal Journey By Carol J. Denego: Review The High Road Of Faith A Personal Journey By Carol J. DenegoCarol J. Denego's book in the style of Alexandra David-Neel takes the reader with her on a tour around the world. She reminds us of the role synchronicity and angels play however unseen in our most perhaps precious moments. This small volume carries a vision of encouragement that I will return to again and again at moments of personal or spiritual inquiry and challenge.
__label__1,"Not what I expected: I love to read and eagerly anticipated this book. However, I was very disappointed and only read about 1/5 of the book. I could have kept going despite its dry tone and uninteresting characters, but the frequent sexual innuendos ruined the book. The sexual references were frequent, and they were crass and unpleasant. I would not recommend this book despite its broadway fame."
__label__1,"A Dangerous/Stupid Concept: Going across America without money,as a spiritual experience is both stupid anddangerous.In this day and age,anything could happen.This book did not uplift my spirit.SORRY!,"
__label__2,"A model biography: Deborah Sampson was not the only female who passed as a male and served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionay War, but her ruse was the most successful, and she bacame the most celebrated female soldier of the era. In this book, Young masterfully presents Sampson's story, peeling away the layers of mythology (many constructed by Sampson hersef) to reveal the truly remarkable life beneath. Young's engagement with the sources and deep knowledge of the historical and social context of Sampson's masquerade(s) make this a model of the historian's craft. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the craft of history, or in Revolutionary America generally."
__label__1,"Sent me the wrong size!: I ordered Men's Wrangler Relaxed Fit Jean size 40x34. When we received the package the shipping receipt AND the label attached to the outside of the pants said the pants were size 40x34. However, when he tried the jeans on the jeans did not fit right. We then checked the inside tag and found that they were really 36x32. We will be returning the jeans. I am usually pleased with ecom.com however this particular item was a birthday present (he received the jeans one day before his birthday so there is no way to get a replacement pair here by tomorrow, his birthday).Hopefully the return process will be smooth and they will send us the right size."
__label__1,"Way to big for an adventureing knife.: I bought this knife mainly for its sturdieness and versatility. When i got it, i opened up the package and found that the sheith is so incredibly bulky and not monuverable i am returning it. Also the handle is of the most not ergonomic designs i have ever seen. This knife would not be good for anything but playing rambo and killing people"
__label__2,Great..: I haven't tried the product yet as my baby isn't born. But it seems to be a good product with good quality. There were many parts to put it together but not too tricky.Shipping was fast too.
__label__1,"kept waiting for it to get better: The story had some good elements and the acting, mostly, was OK. However, I found the show rather dull to watch. I think I would say the directing lacked any ability to engage the audience or to excite the actors. Some later episodes had rather painful dialogue as well, with just bad directing. The CGI was fairly good, though, and the cinematography had some good moments.I guess I got my $15 worth in 6 hours of mildly amusing entertainment. I would only recommend to direhard SF fans, though. I'll likely not watch again as I usually do with SF shows, at least for many years."
__label__2,"Considering the price, they're OK: They're cheap tweezers, but they work OK for me. I can pluck a hair with them, and that's what I want."
__label__2,"Fast way to roll coins: Fast way to roll coins that seem to collect in our house. With Coinstar machines in stores taking nearly 30%, this product makes a fast and family-friendly way to roll. Buying it on ecom.com saved me more than $10 off local big box office store."
__label__2,Great: I got this really for the coffee mug - it works great and makes an excellent cup of coffee! kudos
__label__2,Helpful book: This book has be invaluable in helping my 5 year old overcome her separation anxiety. I was at a lost in how to help her and to prepare her for Kindergarten with the help of this book we are on our way.
__label__2,"Great Recording, Great Band.: ""Reckoning"" is a great album, like most other R.E.M. works. This is from their early years, so it's of the same kind of sound as ""Murmur"" and ""Chronic Town,"" and a little clearer than ""Fables of the Reconstruction"" that followed it.The songs are a nice mix--there's classics like ""So.Central Rain"" and ""(Don't go Back to) Rockville"", plus some lesser-known songs (at least in this day and age) like ""Time after Time (annelise)"" and ""Little America"", two of my favorites. If possible, get the I.R.S. Vintage Years 1984 version, recently released, with five extra tracks--""Windout (with friends)"", ""Pretty Persuasion (live in studio)"", ""White Tornado"", ""Tighten Up"", and a nice cover of ""Moon River.""A good album that every R.E.M. should have."
__label__1,"Cranky Egotistical Exercise in Nothing: I had high hopes when I picked up the book. There's a great story here -- how people are foolish in their behaviors and expectations with respect to events that transpire around them. However, the book reads more like an exposition of how wonderful the author is in recognizing this effect, and how ridiculous everyone else is for not recognizing this themselves. I'll agree with him that there's huge randomness in who is ""lucky enough"" to be in the right place, at the right time, practicing the right strategy for that time, in order to get rich. However, there's nothing rigorous in here that tells me that the author's strategy is better -- how do I know he's also not employing a strategy that ultimately is not worth more than anyone else's strategy? He's definitely smarter than the average guy, but lots of smart people have employed poor strategic choices. I'm on the lookout for a better description of this arena."
__label__2,Perfect Cable at a great price: Go to any store and pay $20-40 for a 6 foot cable. A 25 foot cable working through a splitter and Directv picture is consistent with both TV's for $6.25.Definitely recommend
__label__1,"Yawn: This Cd put me right to sleep. The pianst plays this weird rythym where he speeds up in some places and slows down in others irratically. The pianst for this album must have had trouble reading the music, because there aren't supposed to be any rests in random places. This is a fast dancing piece, hence the title: Danzas Argentinas! If you want a vison for this album, imagine a sprinter running the 400 meter dash. Suddenly the sprinter stops and walks a few paces. And then he speeds back up again, only to stop to tie his shoe. And so on. I would highly recommend another CD. Dude, Martha Argerich has an interpertation that will knock your socks off. Wahhhh!"
__label__2,"practical guide and tips for relaxation: This is a great book for someone who is looking for straight forward practical tips on how to relax. I am not in the medical field, a psychotherapist, etc; just a plain old person looking to educate myself on how to better manage the stress in my life. This guide has been exactly what I've been looking for and all in one place. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to empower themselves to be more relaxed and live a stress-free life."

__label__2,"The Best Lullaby CD you can buy!: I agree with everyone else that this CD will have a special place in your baby's heart for years to come. I received it as a gift when my daughter was born. She's now 7. Both she and my 4 year old son STILL listen to it every night. We've fallen in love with a bunch of other lullaby cd's, but this one is still our favorite."
__label__1,"Perfect Time? No Time!: Makes good coffee quickly, but forget the atomic clock unless you live on a mountain top with Colorado in Clear view (where the signal originates). There is no way to manually set it either--as confirmed by their customer service rep. And, if the clock doesn't set, there is no way to use the automatic timers for brew start, etc."
__label__2,"works pretty well: Works pretty well for the money invested in it. I wouldn't really call it a deep cleaner. It probably cleans at a level between deep and superficial. Sucks up water pretty well. I only use it for spot cleaning (pet accidents :( ) but I imagine cleaning a room efficiently may take a decent amount of time. I found that it was difficult to remove the odor from older urine stains even with pre-soaking and the bissel 2X pet odor solution. I have speckled berber carpet so I just poured some diluted bleach on the stain, let it soak for 2 minutes, then sucked it up with the vacuum cleaner. Removed all the smell. Probably wouldn't recommend bleach for solid colored or nice carpet..."
__label__2,Only one I use...: First found this at Home Depot... but they don't carry them anymore... I sure am glad that I found one thru ecom. They are the best for either watering plants or washing the car... and you can turn them off in either direction... that's really a big help because it allows the user to avoid cranking down thu all the stream levels... and that makes whatever job you're doing get done much faster.
__label__1,"Don't see if you haven't read the book: The graphics are wonderful but the screen writer should be drawn and quartered. If you haven't read the book, or even read it recently there is no way to follow the story. I'm extremely disappointed in the movie but it did make me go back and read the book again after quite a few years. Again, the graphics are amazing and that is why I will watch it once more but from there it may go on the shelf to gather ""DUST""."
__label__1,Chirping problem like most others: I also have the very annoying chirping sound in the audio on most channels. Unacceptable. I'll be returning this TV today.
__label__1,"average music and juvenile lyrics: To me,music is a two part enigma;the music itself and then the lyrics. If the music is awesome it can overtake bad lyrics. However,in the case of Jet,the average music of this band cannot make me overlook the childish,lame,unimaginative lyrics to all of their songs. I know grade school kids that can write better words.Example:""4,5,6,come on and get your kicks"". Seriously? Go to any lyrics based web site and look at their lyrics. Truly pathetic. This band is in serious need of a lyricist. They would be better off in a singer who screams loud so you couldn't understand what he's saying but he sings loud and clear and the words are so bad I'm embarrassed to sing them out loud. So-so music and lame-ass lyrics give this band a one star rating. Hey Jet, here's some lyrics you could use:""4,5,6 your band has awful lyrics"" Or,'Not a 5 but a 1 star 'cause your lyrics are below sub-par"""
__label__2,"Unbleached Coffee Filters are a plus!: We are totally happy with the Melitta brand coffee filters and to be completely truthful we haven't really see the #1 cone filter manufactured or distributed by any one else in our area. We use them in our one cup coffee pot which has a built in filter, however sometime finely ground coffee can still make it into your cup causing sediment in the bottom of your cup of joe and we've have found that these filters help keep the coffee grounds where they belong..., in the filter brew basket! We believe we got a swell price on ecom for 12 boxes and we are now set for practically the whole year. Hope this helped you decide if there right for you as well."
__label__2,"awesome classic: package arrived quick! bought it used but no one could ever tell...there wasn't a scratch, fingerprint, smudge or anything on the disk...it was brand new perfect...i love and appreciate the classics and this was an awesome classic! great customer satisfaction..would definitely buy from this seller again...told all my friends about them!!"
__label__1,"Had to sell it: Even if it is a great idea, it is really hard to use it and to keep it balanced in the air.Too complicated"
__label__1,"Started out fine, then kaput!: This item worked almost perfectly, but then after about a month of use it just completley stopped working. I was extremly dissapointed because it made foods so tender in such a short amount of time. This item is too expense to be so shoddy. Apparently many others have had this issue based on what I see here, and on other sites. Make sure you do your warranty follow up if you decide to purchase it, there is a decent chance that it will malfunction."
__label__1,"It's hard to believe this is a Patterson: Not what I have grown to expect by Patterson. Not a bad nights read but certainly out of character. When you wait and wait for a Patterson and get this I can't help but feel let down. But I give him credit for treading new ground, just do it under a surname."
__label__2,"Wow!: ""Wow"" is all I can say about this book. We read this book as a family activity and our three boys, (11, 9, 4), absolutely loved it. It makes you feel like a kid again. The pop up art is amazing and lovely."
__label__1,"Ehh: I understand the importance of this book, but seriously, we have the internet now. There is nothing in the Chicago Manual of Style that I can't find out on the internet. Mainly people use it for sourcing things that are different from a book or article etc. All of this information can be found elsewhere, namely a book that is smaller than this hunker! Good luck carrying this bad boy around. Good for lifting weights I suppose, will probably save you money on a 10 lb dumbell."
__label__1,"Does not Support Headsets: Contrary to the manufacturer's assertion above, this device does NOT support a wireless headset. I bought it for that specific purpose. When you install, it simply tells you this function is not supported.I am sure there are all sort of good technological reasons why this is the case, but a bit of explicitness on the part of the manufacturer would have been helpful, not to mention honest."
__label__1,"Rip Off--vhs4less.: Rip Off--vhs4less. Obviously a copy--blurry, bad sound, glitches on tape. Sold as ""nearly new"". Yep. It was nearly new and nearly an original, but not an original. Very disappointed and irritated. Won't ever buy from these folks again."
__label__2,Inexpensive and lightweight lens.: This is a good all purpose lens for general use. I'd recommend for someone who just need a basic lens and doesn't have much money to spend.
__label__1,"Second rate home movie: Charlie Sheen produced this home movie starring his father (Martin Sheen), his uncle (Joe Estevez) and himself. This is a B-minus film about dirty cops involved in a drug deal. Almost everything about this film is second rate. The story is predictable and unoriginal. The dialogue is mindless and insipid. The photography is dull and the music is awful. The only redeeming elements are the stunts and pyrotechnics, which are reasonably well done.The acting is mediocre at best. Charlie Sheen is often embarrassingly bad, leaving his dad to carry the film. Uncle Joe is just a throw in to keep the family employed and adds nothing to the film. The three drug goons are wretched.Charlie Sheen's once bright career continues to grind gears with this clunker. I rated it a 4/10. Action lovers might enjoy it, but others will want to pass."
__label__1,"Publishing error is distracting and ruins quality of set: I recently ordered this set off of ecom and each book had a publishing error that reprinted one extra, erroneous word at the end of almost every page. Very irritating. This item was purchased as a gift for a friend's vacation retreat library. The flaw made it tacky and diminished the quality significantly. I had to return it. It was just lazy and cheap of University Press to sell this printing. ecom sent a replacement set and it had the same flaw, even though they assured us that it wouldn't. So, I am going with another publisher altogether, and from another book vendor. Don't waste your money on this more expensive collection. It can't even get the basics right."
__label__1,Absolute CRAP!: This product is junk! They replaced the nice heavy duty cast iron grates that this grill used to come with with this cheap tin crap that warped the 3rd time we used it. Don't buy it!
__label__2,"Judith McNaught wins again!: I've read ""Whitney, My Love"" and ""Until You"" and I fell in love with Clayton and Stephen. When I found out that there was a book about the first Duke of Claymore, I knew that I needed to find it. I did, and I read it. I LOVED IT! McNaught told the story beautifully. I think that I'll go read it again."
__label__2,very good deal: This was the greatest deal I found around! My husband and I watched all of them in a weekend! We loved the extras!
__label__2,"Excellent Choice: We recently purchased this cookware and have been using it for about a month. The cookware is great. It is heavy-weight, but not so heavy that you can't handle it easily. I highly recommend it and would definitely buy it again."
__label__2,"Appearences aren't Everything....: Aside from the fact that Manson is visually repulsive, and his messages are taken to heart by millions of angst ridden adolescents the album is great. I have always been a fan of heavy music, and heavy this is. For those of you that scoff at Manson, this ablum stands up on it's own. I am sure that much of the credit is due Reznor, but nonetheless it's a great listen."
__label__2,"Saves time: If your work computer is set to disconnect when not in use and you can't change it, this is a good solution. If I worked in some classied job then I might understand IT being so paranoid, but I don't and the constant logging off is just annoying."
__label__2,Brass SUN TALISMAN Amulet Divine Light Pendant Charm: Brass SUN TALISMAN Amulet Divine Light Pendant CharmGood product and is as described - could be improved by making it a little larger and heavier.
__label__1,"Skip this author!: I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author."
__label__1,ridiculous price: One star for price as $33.20 is 50%-60% higher than the average price for this product. Really outrageous gouging here please take the time to shop a little.
__label__1,"maybe the next c d: when I first read about the reunion of the Elektric band, i was so excited about it. Order the cd immediately when it was made available. This cd is unlike the excitment i read in the report, the compositions are amazing still but lack the fire of the earlier recordings. Nevertheless, it's still a collectable cd. I too hope for a reunion of rtf, or at least some of the songs re-arrange in the Elektric band style. The next one would be better."
__label__2,"Every feature you could ask for!: This receiver has every modern decoding ability available on physical media. For the price I think it a fantastic bargain. I replaced my Denon AVR 5700 with this unit in order to gain the new HD DD and DTS as well as more capable video switching ----- and to my ears - cannot tell a difference in sound quality. The only qualm I have about this unit is it does run hot. The Denon rarely got warm, but this receiver gets hot, even out in open air. I would strongly recommend against putting this receiver in a closed off AV cabinet. For the money - fantastic bargain."
__label__2,"I wish the Bermuda Triangle books were done like this one.: I read this book a number of times a long time back. My attention returned when I realized that the author's theory of sudden methane releases causing ""bermuda-triangle"" type events is supported by later gas-hydrate buildup discoveries in cold water. This review is from memory -- I just placed an ecom out-of-print order."
__label__1,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OR VERSION 5: A terrible waste of time and money. In fact, embarrassing to the computer profession, and to the psychological profession too. You can do better with 30 minutes of training in Word from a friend."
__label__2,"""The Best of the Best - 'FALL TO GRACE' should be a movie!: I am a woman, and can't imagine what it would be like to be in the Vietnam War. Karlson puts you there, right in the heart of the heart of it all! Dark and Light, Beauty and Truth, Tears and Fears. It is All here. You will be touched by the courage it took Karlson to act from what is right and the influence that those actions had. This book will touch you deeply to the Light of your Being. I promise!"
__label__1,"Didn't Work Well: Worked o.k. for about 5 minutes, then hose clogged up. Apparently it's the humidity. But I live in Florida so humidity is a fact of life here. Guess I'll have to spring for a big rental blaster to get my job done."
__label__1,"Worst Item I ever ordered from ecom: It seems that I can't review this as a no stars item, but that is my real number. It was shipped on time, but the product looks like something I would walk by in a Dollar Store. The sweater is not. It's a very thin material that you couldn't even use as a rag. The mask looks more like a hobo than Freddie Kruger. The mask will fall apart in a short time because it's made out of som sort of compressed paper scrap. I could have left off the s in scrap. Don't buy this for your kid, he is better than that."
__label__1,"Cheese Cake during World War II: Elmer Simms Campbell was one of the few African American cartoonists to break the color line. He drew cartoons for Esquire from 1933-1953. Few people knew that Campbell was a black man. His cartoons were primarily of scantily clad white women or pin up girls. This book is a collection of his cartoons, but there isn't even a bio on the artist. There is no commentary on Campbell or his work.For more information on Campbell you can google him and find some information on Wikipedia. Or better still go to Tim Jackson's site: ""Pioneering Cartoonists of Color.""Historically, Campbell is often credited with being the first African American cartoonist, but George Herriman, a creole who passed for white, was really the first. He was the creator of Krazy Kat. Ollie Harrington and Jackie Ormes were two other pioneering black cartoonists."
__label__1,"Died after 2 years: I read those positive reviews here and bought this item 2 years ago. It worked pretty well at the beginning. Starting from about a year ago, it couldn't keep the rice moistured for long. Now, it is no better than a 20 bucks rice cooker and I have to replace it."
__label__2,"bialetta review: Great product, well designed. And it makes an excellent cup of coffee. My only complaint, which I should have realized beforehand, is that the physical size is small for American stoves: it uses only about a quarter of the heating element. My partial solution is to preheat the water in a kettle to boiling beforehand, fill the base, assemble the parts quickly, and move the bialetti back to the hot element."
__label__1,"Zero-star review: Beautiful unit, looks great on my black Corian counter top.Too bad the delicious coffee this thing produces is luke warm.The hot pad does manage to keep the pot of coffee tepid.If you are looking for a unit that makes coffee you can CHUG down, this is it. So try to contact Braun to report a problem... ha. They obviously don't care about feedback. I sure hope ecom is more responsive and takes this thing back rather than referring me to an authorized repair center. Mr. Coffee, sorry I cheated on you... will you take me back? I swear, if this hadn't been a gift, I never would have strayed. Again, luke warm when it comes out of the little hole, hot plate doesn't get it any hotter. Total bummer."
__label__1,"""American"" Lawn Mover made in CHINA!: I really give it zero starts. This does not fit the mower it is advertised with, nor the sizes it states it accomodates. Another crappy Chinese product."
__label__1,unrealistic view of the malagasy people and their island: madagascar is a beautiful island and the people are the friendliest i have ever encountered. after spending 4 months living and working among them i found that their devotion to God is second to none and their ability to find joy despite what the world would describe as humble circumstances is unparalleled. this disappointing book doesn't accurately portray madagascar nor the people who live there. personally it offends me and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
__label__1,"UGGH!!!: There are no words to describe this god-awful Christmas CD put out by a good singer who could have done way better!! Most of the tunes are no different than her pop material (which she needs to give up) with the exception of ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"" which is outstanding. For that one, I'll give this CD One star! But that's being generous!!!"
__label__2,The music here is sweet!: 98 Degrees and Stevie Wonder show their abilities here. So does Donny O. But I think the ochestra steals the show on this CD.
__label__2,"Times and Seasons: This series was wonderful. I read all three books within 4 days. I felt like I was part of that community. Like they were my neighbors. In the second book, Cathy's boyfiends daughter changed to Amanda then in the third book changed back to Tracy."
__label__1,Outdated but a good history of the sport: Seriously needs an update. Talks about wooden decoys as the state-of-the-art and fails to note a number of advances we enjoy in the 1998. Would be a good resource for the beginner to get a few of the basics down like do not move in the blind and camoflauge is necessary.
__label__2,I would recommend: The shipping container left a lot to be desired and the shipping company didn't take very good care. The product itself is very easy to use and maintain. It seems to be built well enough to pass down a generation or two. I'm having fun with it.
__label__1,"movie fails miserably where stage play soars!: This movie was the biggest dissappointment of the early 90's! In an attempt to make it relevant to western viewers, the film makers completely changed the story, the music, and the over-all tone of this important piece of theater. Whoopi, of all people!? Give me a break! She was horrible. And why would you change the most beautiful and powerful South African Township music to sound like African American gospel music? It just didn't work for me at all. If you've only seen the movie version and never had the opportunity to experience Sarafina on stage, you probably won't be able to understand where I'm coming from. Having been blessed with seeing it twice as it toured the country, I can say with out a doubt that the movie version failed miserably where the stage play soared to the highest heights!"
__label__1,"Made me feel physically ill for days afterward: Though it kept me turning the pages, it was not an enjoyable book for me. By the time I was done, I felt like I had the stomach flu--nauseous and exhausted.The true horror of his story is not only the situations the characters find themselves in but the overwhelming feeling of hopelessness that pervades throughout the book. I couldn't help but think that the title of the book is aptly named. Even though there are no actual archeological ruins in the book, I felt like the actual ""ruins"" are the characters themselves.WARNING -- SPOILER FOLLOWS --They each die in a state of ruin--physically (from a variety of excruciating injuries), emotionally (from a breakdown of their own humanity), and spiritually (no sense of God or any kind of hope).If nihilism could be considered horror, then I guess this qualifies. Otherwise, 20% creepy, 80% stomach-turning and depressing."
__label__1,"Trees died for this book ?: Dylan's prose in this book is full of ""hip cat"" babble and no substance. I actually began to laugh everytime he launched into his hip cat speak - which should qualify his memoir as a comedy work. A pitiful piece of work from someone trying to remain relevant.I mean man this read is like a razor blade cuttin' lunch meat at the deli counter of hard life - walkin' down a road with no end or begining and heavy traffic all goin' the same direction. Sleepin' on a couch that is too hard and too short and was made that way just for you. Through my eyes it attacked my soul like fire burning hungry dogs that are tryin' to steal your refrigerator.The book will appeal to Dylan sycophants, but everyone else can save their money."
__label__1,Save some $$$$$: Threelac is very expensive for the amount that you get and is not a strong probiotic blend.Best bet is to go to your health food store/or online and look for a good probiotic blend that is not only less expensive but stronger than Threelac
__label__2,"Best Tank simulator ever made!Hands down: My brother bought this game first and after playing it for five minutes i had to have it.How underpowered was the US Sherman tank?Play the true story of Barkmans corner where a single German panther took on a whole division of shermans.Almost all of the battles are true stories along with each individual characteristics of armor,fire power,speed,etc..No other tank/combat game comes close.Once you learn the controls you will play for hours!"
__label__1,"Not so waterproof: I chose this thermometer because I thought it would be simple to sanitize it for homebrewing, since it claims to be waterproof. The first time I submerged it in water, the display area filled halfway with water. It annoyed me, but was still usable. I dried it and put it in a drawer. When I fished it out a week later, the numbers on the display had faded to the point where it was unusable.I'll be exchanging it for another of the same type, but from now on I'll be keeping the plastic area completely away from water!"
__label__2,Never fails to lift your spirit!: Casting Crowns has again recorded a fantastic CD. Each trak has a unique message that appeals to everyone and touches even the hardest of hearts.
__label__2,very very effective: I purchased this in 2008 from ecom and have to say that if you want to shake some fat off your body this will deftnitely do it. I used this today again and its funny that I actually feel lighter after getting back to Turbo Jam after Xmas. It really does the trick and I do recommend it because it goes by so fast and I like the music even though her other workouts have better songs. Anymore I find ordinary aerobics very boring and they just dont have the fun factor that turbo jam has and that is needed to get through a grueling workout. buy this because it works and is fun with never a dull moment. I am in my forties with fibromyalgia and if I can do it so can you by taking it slowly and building up to the full program. This is what I had to do so you do it to. Okay?
__label__1,"french press: Wasn't too excited when I received this. It seemed to be in other than new condition! When I contaacted the seller, I felt the response was not too professional and more rude than anything. I kept the mug just because I did not want to deal with packaging and sending it back. Can't win them all!"

__label__1,"Not worth the money: ecom ran a special on this today. 99 cents for streaming of the movie. Not worth the dollar. Bad plot, bad acting and an implausible script. Movie was 1 hour and 49 minutes. I could not wait for it to be over. In fact I turned if off with 10 minutes to go. That is 1 hour and 49 minutes of my life I will never get back."
__label__2,"New Favorite Toy: I purchased this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. He has so much fun watching the car race around the house! I was worried about the car being small, but it is a pretty large car great side for a toddler. Great fun for my little Cars fan!"
__label__2,"Great reciever for price: I bought this a couple months ago to round out Home theater, and for the price, I am very impressed.As many said though, the manual is rediculous, it took many tries to get things working right, especially seeing I used the surround rear remapped to bi wire my fronts. Once it was set though, amazing results. Just stick with it, and read/understand the whole manual before tweaking anything, reading as you go will doom you to confusion of a whole new level, because they do this thing where certain parts of the setup are not grouped together, and are explained more 10 pages in, maybe mentioning the final info you need 20 pages in. And thats just for speaker setup!!"
__label__2,"Pretty much sums it up: Doesn't look like we'll be seeing another record from Eldritch and company anytime soon, so the likelihood of a second volume gets considerably less likely with each passing year. This compilation does nicely. SOM, like a lot of goth of this era was mostly about image. What set these guys apart now and then was sarcasm and the ability to write hooks. Eldritch wasn't above letting you in on their big rock joke, which probably blew it for a lot of people. Taken apart from the image, together, one realizes how much the songs sound alike. Nevertheless, I still get the urge to break out the smoke machine, stand against a wall in a dark bar, and feel modishly alienated when I hear it."
__label__1,"Mala experiencia: Cuando compré el producto lo hice porque especificaba que eran dos discos de pelicula uno DVD y un Blueray que venian en idiomas para escuchar español, ingles y francés. Al recibir los discos, el DVD de la película solo se oye en ingles y francés, ya he remitido varias quejas inclusive al suplidor y nadie me ha dado respuesta de esta situación, si se está ofertando una misma película en dos formatos debe de haber los mismo en ambos discos, esto es inaceptable, en tal caso de ben hacerlo constar en las sugerencias/"
__label__2,"Changed my view of things.: I stumbled across this book in the midst of moving to my new home. To be honest I didn't know I owned this book. As soon as I began to read it, I couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've read in years. Kay Redfield Jamison puts words together so perfectly and examines her life with Manic Depressive Illness beautifully. Suggested to everyone."
__label__1,"Baby Enthusiast: I wish Avent would give me back all the money I spent on these bottles. The leaking is ridiculous, 5 a.m. is no time to be changing baby p.j's drenched in formula! Save yourself the misery and buy any other bottle but these."
__label__2,"Great book: This book was purchased as a gift, and I couldn't be more pleased. It is so fun to find a present you know is unique and entertaining, not to mention intellectual stimulation. The recipient loved it. I bought one more just keep in the living room when guests want something besides TV to entertain them."
__label__1,"Jane's Train Recognition Guide: This book was too much overview and too little detail. Distinguishing features were not addressed, i.e. how do you tell the difference between a GP38 and a GP40?It was like a bird recognition guide that showed a nice full-color picture of every finch in the world but showed no ditinguishing marks like beaks and wing shapes.Very disappointing."
__label__2,"The originals: I love this double set of Robert Johnson's complete recorded output because it highlights the legacy we have experienced through subsequent artists. You must have ever heard 'Sweet Home Chicago', 'Walking Blues', 'Cross Road Blues' 'Rambling on my mind', 'Come on in my kitchen' 'Traveling riverside blues' 'From four until late' etc in some form of other. We owe this man so much! In addition, these tracks still stand up after some many years."
__label__1,"Wish My Alarm Clock Could Talk, Too!: You know from the moment the talking alarm clock appears, and you have to stop your car so washing machines can cross the street, you're in for a very different read. But, ho hum, what a tremendously boring book! It's ""film noir"" atmosphere is lame and convoluted; the premise, while interesting, is about as original as Spam; and the characters merely cardboard and as interesting as ""The Blair Witch Project."" I hate this book, because it insults us with so many bizarre images, and expects us to find it amusing. The inclusion of God as a focal character is just too much poetic license. A real drag; don't waste your time."
__label__2,"Perfect for your fein and not super expensive.: They are made to fit your fein and they're not too expensive. I haven't filled my first bag, but I only use it for powered hand tools, in my hobby use. They do work well for keeping the filter clean and the suction high (keeps the dust from clogging the filter). Buy it if you don't have a high use and don't want to fuss with adapting another bag, otherwise you can get a shop vac brand to work on them (as well as the shop vac HEPA filter)."
__label__2,"A moving and detailed account of the Raj and Partition: I am not an expert on the subcontinent, and I found this book to be well written and gripping. It ties together events occurring at nearly the same time, so the reader gets a feeling for the huge tragedy that overtook India. I had read Paul Scott's The Raj Quartet and Staying On, which are fictional accounts of the Partition. This book filled in many of the historical details that serve as backdrop for the Scott novels. I like that this book does not glamourize the English Raj, many of whom were clerks elevated to masters in the British India. It does seem more negative toward Jinnah and the Muslims than the Hindus, but I do not yet know whether this is a fair depiction. The Sikhs come off very badly. It succeeds in inspiring the reader to seek out more facts about India and Pakistan."
__label__1,"Worthless!: This thing is unusable because it is too fat to fit 99% of my USB ports. It won't fit the recessed ports in the front of my desktop, it won't fit the ports in my laptop if the network cable is also installed, and it won't fit the rear USB ports of my desktop if the monitor also happens to be plugged in! Unbelievably stupid design. Look for one that is more narrow!"
__label__1,"never made it out of the box: I was going to be one of those folks who just ordered a new set rather than pay the ridiculous price of replacing the batteries. But the set I ordered, which clearly shows the item with the large sized batteries, came with the much smaller batteries that are about 1/2 as tall. So back it went without ever taking it out of the box. They apparently get away with that enough to keep doing it, even though in my case it was a double shipping cost to them with no revenue.I'll also mention that around the same time I found out through a local mechanic who stocks Interstate batteries that you can send in these tool batteries and Interstate will rebuild them--not just Dewalt, any such battery that's not in a sealed case. Here they cost me $45 each plus sales tax. Not cheap but better than most anything else I've found. And if I do it through my mechanic who gets regular visits from the Interstate truck, there's no shipping"
__label__1,"Quality inconsistent: My last purchase of 4 cases of this food had a sour off- smell. Called natural balance customer service, they said they hadn't received complaints about that batch, they'd pass info along to tech dept, they'd send me a coupon for 1 case.... But, it's a natural product, and variation ""was to be expected"". They suggested I return it to the retailer. Paying for shipping 3 times (receiving, sending back, receiving again) for a heavy product like this makes it very expensive.I've fed this variety to my 3 cats for a year (alternate with Natural Balance Ultra), and they have always loved it. They will only eat this batch if they are very very hungry. I can barely stand to open the cans. All other batches had a clean fresh smell.I'm disapointed with the customer service response to a quality issue from a heavy user of their premium priced product. (I have 3 cats). I won't buy from Natural Balance again. I'll use the coupon locally, and make sure I'm mixing production runs."
__label__1,"Worst Music I've EVER heard: If you are an american, you will not like this music.Do not listen to anybody who says this music is good.Rice can't sing. A previous poster said that his 'human imperfections' unwravel Rice's soul and add character to his words. Don't believe it. Rice can't sing, and it's not cute or admirable that he tries to sing and wears his soul on his sleeve even though he can't sing.Damien Rice can't hold a candle to Dave Matthews, or to Leanard Cohen. 'Suzanne' is a classic, and ""A blower's Daughter"" is a cacauphanous, jumbled, out-of-tune, unmelodic, vomit of a song.I wasted my money on this CD, don't you do the same."
__label__2,"Perfect Match: I was dubious about ordering an after market replacement battery for my Porter Cable cordless drill. Upon receipt of the topcell replacement I found that it fit my charger just as the original battery did and when charged, fit the drill perfectly."
__label__2,"Even better than her first one!: Lots of great breads in this book--Banana Nut Swirl Bread, Moravian Love Buns, and whole-grain recipes. There are quite a few breads using the dough only cycle, including a selection of holiday breads from around the world. One thing that makes these books unique is their full size and lush color photos. [Use a cookbook protector as you'll be sorry to get them floured. ;^)]If you've grown tired of throwing a mix in the machine and ending up with ""box"" bread, then this is the book for you."

__label__2,"Fun for my kids: My 21 month old daughter and 3 year old son both enjoy this toy. They both pretend to take pictures with the camera and we have even pretended to use the compass and map together to find treasures in the backyard. Plus, if something is missing I will likely find it in the backback as that's where they stick all of their random ""stuff""."
__label__2,Excellent Ergonomic Grip on Radius tools: The curved ergonomic grip allows excellent leverage when digging & cultivating. I could apply much stronger force without stressing out my wrists and forearm as in traditional straight grips.
__label__1,"Not worth the money: I bought this book because I am studying Stoicism and wanted to read some modern works. Unfortunately, all I learned from it was the author's philosophical views. It was apparent from the beginning that his understanding of Stoicism is superficial at best. If you really want to learn the Stoic art of living read something written by a Stoic, either ancient or modern."
__label__1,"Is it over yet?: I like many speakers that break old paradigms, but Eckhart Tolle is definitely not one of them. Highly overrated and boring as hell. My spouse and I tried to watch this video in where he is in Findhorn, Scotland (thinking there might actually be stuff about the place) and there was NOTHING about Findhorn, Scotland. He just happened to be there when it was filmed at some hall. This video was many hours of him sitting completely still (he sat like a stiff puppet the whole time) with some flowers just plopped on the floor in front of him and no matter how many times we fast-forwarded to get to something ""good"", it never happened. From what I could see, even the audience was inanimate. I hope they didn't pay too much for the multi-hour torture session.Michael Beckwith, Gregg Braden, Louise Hay, and many others are far better than Tolle."
__label__2,"must read: I love this series! It's funny, inspirational, and adventerous! We started this series in a small church group and all of us are loving it!"
__label__2,"Fantastic teaching tool for fans, too: This is a great instructional DVD, not only for wrestlers but for fans. I learned a lot from listening to Dan Gable's explanations and watching the demonstrations by the Zadick brothers. What I learned from the DVD has made watching wrestling matches even more enjoyable."
__label__1,"Too much like a textbook: I was really excited to get this book and very disappointed with it when it arrived. It is very dry, and presented like a textbook. For such a subject, the author takes things way too seriously, and could of had a lot more fun with this, as opposed to just presenting a dry textbook style report. Good pictures though"
__label__1,"a difficult and obtuse read, for the scholar only.: Although this book has plenty of information, the vast majority of it is presented in such a lenghty and wordy manner that it is very difficult to follow, much less to understand. Any reader will be sure to find something useful and interesting in the various topics covered, but be prepared to be completely lost on a regular basis."
__label__2,"Nice poster, marginally practical as a map.: The size of the map is about 36X48. The political boundaries are modern, however, the look of the map is antique by design. It makes a nice poster. For classroom use it is better than nothing, but it is difficult to see from the back of the room. Overall color of the map is tan, like parchment. Only the borders have color."
__label__2,"GREAT ALBUM: I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS ALBUM, BUT I'LL START BY SAYING WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, IT STAYED IN MY CD PLAYER FOR OVER A YEAR, LITERALLY. I COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT AND I LISTENED TO EVERY SINGLE SONG, THERE ARE NO JUNK SONGS ON IT LIKE THERE ARE ON MOST CDS. TO THIS DAY, A DECADE AFTER ITS INITIAL RELEASE I STILL PLAY IT TO DEATH, IT'S JUST THAT GOOD A RECORD. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU GET IT. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE HYPE AND YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU FINALLY HEARD IT."
__label__2,"What a knife!!!: Now I know why people rave about this knife. WOW! Makes my other knife look like a rolling pin. It chops with the least amount of effort applied, handle feels like it was made just for my hand, balance is excellent, & food doesn't stick to it at all. In order for me to try it, I had to wait for my sister to leave the room because she won't let anyone touch it. She loves this knife that much. Another well made German product. Can't wait for mine to arrive so I could enjoy using it too."
__label__1,"Lots to say, nothing new.: Mark Dery's writing style makes my mind wander and fails to pull me in. He mentions something about everything, from Ace Ventura's anal speech to the burning of Waco. ""The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink"" gives short insight into life's odd episodes, freak shows, and moments of insanity but misses out on making a statement worthy of reaction. As I read, I kept thinking, ""yes, I know, so what?"" Give me something, anything. I guess was expecting more."
__label__2,"Almost a home run: I'm a huge fan of the American Idol competition. This Season 5highlights CD was generally well done and a greatrepresentative sampling, but it was spoiled for meby the choice of Elliott's song ""Moody's Mood for Love"" whichis a minefield of potential pitch and phrasing problems.Very few singers can navigate this minefield successfullyand even Elliott was no exception. What's worse isthere should have been several more sets of trained earsto catch this early on during production and a different songselected for Elliott. As it was, this piece sticks out as apainful reminder of what could have been, had more care beentaken and more ears deployed in service of a good cause.Otherwise the CD is enjoyable listening and a fine showcaseof the Top 12 for Season 5."
__label__2,"Slow build up with a Great finish: I found this book to have a bit of a slow buildup, which was probably necessary in order to provide us the necessary background on the two main characters, Mundy and Sasha. Once the main storyline kicked into gear, the results were outstanding. I wouldn't call this book Anti-American. In fact, you could argue that this book is pro-American, in that it reflects the great American ideals of rebellion and challenging tyranny.This book does oppose the opinions of the current presidential administration. It speaks to the neo-McCarthyism that existed at the start of the Iraqi War. I have to think though that today, in 2007, the vast majority of Americans realize what a bill of goods they were sold.It was a very interesting read that also makes you think."
__label__2,"Covers More than Homework: This book was extremely helpful in working with my 9-year-old. Rather than just tips and tricks for homework hassles with your kid, this book teaches PARENTS how to better guide their children so - methodically in turn - children magically start accepting their responsibilities, which in the end prepares them for responsible adulthood. The more you hound, the more you ""hover,"" the more you check on them, the more you worry for them, the less they do themselves, which progressively makes them more dependent on you and less on themselves. This theory took me by surprise, as I wanted to be extremely involved with my child's work in school. But I had no idea I was actually hindering her growth and understanding of responsibility and accountability. The book also offers help for parents and children with consistent homework problems, attitudes and resistance. Excellent and easy-to-read."
__label__1,"Boring: This movie was not for me. I felt it lacked plot, depth, and any sort of ability to entertain or capture an audience. There is symbolism through out the movie, but you have to be looking for it and know what it is when you see. At best this is a rental, but only if you really, really want to see it. Otherwise, I say pass."
__label__1,Not the Same: I was hoping this fragrance was the same as the one from the 90's. Unfortunately it isn't and the scent is not too flattering. I ended up giving the product away.
__label__1,"Not like it used to be: Boy, Nestle chocolate is not at all as it used to be. I used to love it. You can't find it in a store and now I know why, it's awful! I hadn't seen it for so long then saw it on-line. I ate a few, the last one I couldn't even finish it was so awful to me. I gave my friend the box, told her maybe you will like it."
__label__2,Great product!: I've used turbo tax for the last two years to prepare my taxes and find it to be very user friendly. The software walks you through step by step and provides prompts to enter information when needed. I plan to use Turbo Tax to prepare my 2000 taxes.
__label__1,Plastic tadpoles would be better!: My daughter was REALLY excited about this gift. Tadpoles took 5 weeks to get. 5 weeks later the first one died and she was devistated. Neither tadpole made any changes and the second tadpole has now died. ...
__label__1,Performers better than the material.: Gwen Verdon and Richard Kiley give fine performances here but the material is decidedly second-rate.Though the show won the 1959 Tony award it has never been revived and will probably NEVER see a full-scale revival.The disc is for musical theatre completists only.
__label__2,Elvis review: If you bought this you proably already like Elvis music. This cd is worth the money. Many of my favorite Elvis songs were in his movies and never released as singles or for that matter hits. This is a great way for me to hear them again.
__label__1,"Not much in-depth information, bit superficial.: I expected much more information on how Winona Ryder really is, her hobbies, likes and dislikes etc. If I am correct, the author of this book didn't even have contact with ms. Ryder herself. Still, it gives a summary of her movies, which is nice."
__label__1,"Caution - won't work long: I got this for my youngest daughter as she absolutely loves music. The company is out of business which is why this item is drastically reduced. Within 2 days, it quit working. Seems as though there is a short under one of the blocks. Tried to have my husband fix it. It worked for about 1/2 an hour afterwards. At this point it's useless as a music toy. My daughter does enjoy the colorful blocks. Great idea, poor product quality control. Buyer beware. Hope yours doesn't break like mine. There's no recourse."
__label__1,"disappointed in this one: Didn't like this book as well as the Little Soul and the Sun. As we had a home birth and this book is all about a baby born into the hospital. Also the book ends abruptly, kind of odd.....like there should be another chapter atleast."
__label__1,"Cute but Sheds: The look of this stuffed sloth is very cute and realistic but the toy sheds like none other. Just brushing your hand over its ""fur"" will cause many many fibers to come off. May be good for putting on display on a shelf, but definitely not good for a child's toy."
__label__1,not good: this is a horrible book. it jumps around and you never know who is talking. i wish i had seen the movie before i read the book. i think i would have liked the book if i had of. it was just too jumbled.
__label__1,"thanks for nothing.: For a start the title is misleading as there are no Hollywood, no sex and no wars. Most chicks plainly plain with acting abilities well below zero. What this flick reflect perfectly is general confusion about life in US--nobody work but has money, how everybody pays bills is mystery, prostitution is illegal and has negative image so chicks are trying to do their best to look...ehehe hard to say from the movie. What everybody does is drugs, drinking and havinng good time and in addition chicks trying to extort money from guys. Family values left in 19th century etc. You get the idea. Yes, couple times we see tits. Should I continue?"
__label__1,stay away from this Z-grade torture-porn rubbish: Do not get fooled by the cover. The sets look cheap. The actors do not even have any acting talents except when they are dead. Throw away the logical aspect of life and you get this movie!!! Avoid at any costs!

__label__1,"a cute idea, but don't bother: When I started using Lexar Jumpdrives, I picked this up, thinking it would be neat to be able to use as an MP3 player. It does have a decent display, which made it nicer than what I had before, and of course you get limitless storage space - just buy more Lexar Jumpdrives (which I think are great).However, there are some problems. First, despite following the directions, I have never been able to get this to work properly when I write music files from my Mac. Also, in the intervening two years, cheaper and better MP3 players have made this pointless. The new iPod shuffle (admittedly, no screen) is smaller, lighter, runs much longer, has a built in rechargeable battery, and is about the same price (assuming you buy this accessory and a 1GB Lexar jumpdrive)."
__label__2,"Good flow, but a little repetitive: The first song (which is the same as the second) reminds me of the song they play in the movie Broken Flowers with Bill Murray. Anyways this cd does consist of some good afro-funk, but does not venture too much musically (Best aspect = the guitar, holding it down with the wah). I think I expected a little more even though I know it's supposed to be simple. Also the give it up turn it loose cover isn't as good as i'd hoped. If you're into Fela Kuti, and other afro funk or funk in general then this would be a good pick up."
__label__2,"Star Wars love: Great price for a great set. The quality on the blu rays left much to be desired. The picture isn't as crisp as I would have liked, but the sound is always top notch. If you like Star Wars and you can't stand DVD quality anymore, get this. Don't ask questions, just get it if you love Star Wars"
__label__1,"Incompatible with Samsung Home Theater HT-Z410: It's incompatible with the Samsung HT-Z410, and it was the only reason I ordered it. Returning it. Otherwise, it was in great condition for a refurbished unit. No insult to the sender."
__label__2,"The Master of Pop: They don't make pop like this anymore. Now it's all hip/hop beats and rappers barging in the middle of records to keep it real. But back in the day, Michael Cruz was the master of Pop.He could lay down a groove, or come up with a hook with the best of them. He had plenty of r n'b running through his Cuban soul and love of the Top 40 hit,but he had the talent and emotion tomake it ring true. I especially like the amazing melody of ""This Time"" that keeps building like a lover's plea and ""Never Again""which I dare you to not keep singing long after the song is over.But the best, is the classic song ""The Heart Never Forgets""-- Michael's vocal is heartfelt and the string coda at the end ismagical. Unfortunately, Michael left us much too soon- but finally, we have this!"
__label__1,"Pointless Potty Tray: I would not recommend this product! You can just place the potty pad on the floor and get the same results! My dog actually likes to tug the potty pad out of the tray, but, when I place the potty pad on the floor, he does not mess with it!"
__label__2,"all right by me !!!: This ""Sedona"" style salad plate by Pfaltzgraff is indeed dishwasher and microwave safe. The manufacturer claims that it is also oven and freezer safe; but I can't comment on that because I haven't used it in the oven and freezer.Although this is made to be a salad plate; this can also be used for deserts and meals with smaller portions. Great!The design of the plate is very smart. The dark shade of blue in the center is nicely complemented by the warm, earthy tones with abstract shapes all around the circumference of this nine inch wide plate. The overall effect certainly does give it that vibrant southwest feel; the design can also go with many contemporary and even modern dining room sets.This salad plate is hand painted; that impresses me. There is a five year warranty but with the great design of these plates I doubt you'll ever need it! When I handle the plate it feels very sturdy and solid.Get a set of these plates today--and enjoy!"
__label__2,Wonderful CD: I got this cd about 3 years ago for my birthday and from the moment I put it in the cd player I loved it. This is probably one of my favorite celine dion cds and I own them all. I love the song Calling You and I also really love the song Elle. This is a beautiful cd and well worth the money. This cd is worth the money alone just for the song Calling You. This is a beautiful cd and a must buy for any celine dion fan or someone who just wants to listen to a great cd.
__label__2,"The Proper Care of Dr. Laura: I think Doc Laura has written some fabulous books. And this is just one of many. The beauty is, each book it a tiny bit different so you really get a good morsal of truth in each one if you read it really really carefully. In this book, I've learned how to not have my husband leave me, and really, isn't that a pretty important thing? Especially when you have children!!!! You have a responsibility towards your children and the thing is, I'm my kid's mom so I especially have a responsibility. It doesn't really matter who the real baby daddy is it's just important who's watching them now. And you don't want to lose that man. So read this book."
__label__2,"Good Postwar Footage.: You know, the 1950s must have been a really weird time to grow up in. I've ordered a bunch of these government training films (mostly for the camp value, some are hilarious) and can't believe how steadfast the government was that kids were about to become a huge problem that could be solved by showing them terrifying films.This one takes a similar, if slightly different tact. As far as I can tell the governement must have been worried that with teh war over kids would get out of high school and just sit at home and mooch of their parents. So, they figured they needed to scare them into the idea that if they didn't get a job they would be scum.The result is the expected silliness and overblown moral messages that are always good for a laugh."
__label__2,"Only 1 Review?: Theres only 1 review for this version - and i must say - this is the best version. Playstations version didnt hold up to this one - nor the Windows 95 version (yea...old game)anyway, this game got me hooked on the series - until i was sickened by the newer ones (they suck horribly) the graphics were awesome in this game (now, with todays technology - they're laughable) but this game is the original relase, and the best of the series. give this version a try - its a blast."
__label__2,"Swell!: Well, this is certainly a refreshing book. The tone is conversational, but the content is technical. However, the book is easy to use as a way to learn ASP. One thing that is a bit of a bother is the reliance on the .DLLs that ship with the book. I didn't have the time to fool around with installing examples and stuff that I can't see myself using or needing. But, you can just skip over these without losing understanding, if you want."

If you want historical INACCURACY this is a movie for you and if you just want plain incompetent movie making, then you'll have the twice the fun.Farrell is too clean cut to be considered seriously at an outlaw and this movie won't help his career any. The only saving grace is Timothy Dalton and a cameo of Kathy Bates. Oh and I guess I didn't really have to pay for this stinker. Thank goodness."
__label__1,"Left hangng: Troll Quest is a well written book until you get to the last chapter where the author appears to have just gotten tired of writing. The book builds slowly, a well written storyline headed for a climactic finale and then the reader is left hanging with no conculsions and no sequel. Very frustrating and disappointing."
__label__2,"Sometimes Less is More: Unless you're a major Hollies fan, this CD version of the LP will have everything you want, compared with the longer 1-CD ""All TIme Greatest Hits"", but won't tie up your CD player for 50% longer. Both CDs are terrific; this one is more to the point."

__label__2,"Bureau 13 combines outrageous Sci-Fi with nonstop humor: I have read and re-read this book so many times that it is literally in tatters. I need a new copy, that's how good this book is! Truly an unsung classic, which leaves you salivating for more...Nick Pollotta does indeed give us more, with the books ""Full Moonster"", and ""Alien Academy"", both fantastic and worthy sequels, which follow storylines brilliantly! I had the DISTINCT PLEASURE of corresponding with the author himself, and I learned that Tri-Tac Books will be re-releasing the trilogy in March of 2000 if all goes well, but until then, I will continue my hunt for an original print copy! DON'T MISS THIS BOOK! ! !"

__label__2,"Super nice knives made in USA!: First off I'll admit that I haven't owned any expensive knives. When my husband told me it was time for some new ones, I did some research. We try our very best to only buy made in USA if it is available, and the reviews on these knives were good. When they first arrived, I loved the look of them, but the handles felt ""weird"" to touch. Since I had only been using plastic or wooden handles, I decided I might get used to that. I have now had them for almost a month, and I absolutely love them!! The weight feels good, and they are so sharp and fit my hand nicely. The feel of the handles no longer bothers me, but instead, I enjoy cooking even more because I do have a decent set of knives. I didn't realize what I was missing! Great price, great knives, extremely satisfied!!"

__label__1,THE SWG DEV TEAM SHOULD BE FIRED: People DO NOT purchase this game or any other SOE releases. The SWG dev team must be held accountable for theyre sole ruination of the SWG game. All attempts by customers to seek support with SOE customer service has been negated. THIS IS AN AWFUL product and I suggest highly that anyone interested in playing a online game do not purchase A SOE release. Try playing WOW or Matrix Online instead.one of thousands disgruntled andangerd customersthat have left theSWG game. SOE is terrible.
__label__2,"Rare classic.. never get's old: This cd is great. I picked it up at a used store years ago after hearing the track ""The Rope"" on the radio. You can definetly hear the Beatles influences with some Black Crowes funk. Great vocals and guitars. Very catchy...Stand out tracks: The Rope, Modern Pie, Lie To Me"
__label__1,"Bionaire BAP3175 Total Dud!!: Do not buy this product! We purchased this same item and it worked for about a month. There is no support from the company and I have found multiple accounts online of similiar performance. Actually the accounts of working for about a month are across the Bionaire product line, so they obviously have systemic quality problems...Don't waste your money or your time on this product line."
__label__1,"I really wanted to like this CD.: I had such high hopes, but the main word that came to mind while listening to this CD is ""shrill,"" with the word ""grating"" not far behind. Judging from the applause, the audience had a great time in 1992 when this was performed, but maybe the sound technicians were too into the music and not checking their levels enough. High notes are piercing, the mixes seem uneven, some of performances sound like they're taking place in an empty warehouse. But worse are that many of the songs just aren't pleasing to the ear--shrill horns, singers that are either too operatic or sound like they're struggling to hit the notes. Oy. The songs that I mostly enjoyed were ""Softly Falls the Gentle Night"" with Gail Wynters (and it's really an R&B song) and ""We Three Kings,"" though both were still plagued with mixing issues. I recommend you take a listen to an NPR Piano Jazz Christmas with Marian McPartland (and others) instead of this album. (P.S. Shouldn't that be ""Toward the Light""?)"
__label__1,"Overpriced for the knock-off quality, but better than nothing: This item says it is made in Germany, but the metal finish is horrible and uneven, and the plastic pieces are not cut flush. The engineering and manufacturing is horrible, and it is not as sturdy as any of the older Staedtler compasses I used in the past. I don't know what kind of compasses other reviewers have been using (I'm not being flippant) but if this is the quality you get from a German compass sold for 24 dollars, then maybe it's time to just switch to Chinese product :("
__label__1,"No, no, no, NO!: In the early 1970s, my school system adopted Roberts English as its grammar curriculum. My 2nd grade class was the first class to use it. The school system abandoned it when I was in 8th grade. It was the most confusing, confounding, ridiculous way to teach grammar. My 9th grade English teacher was horrified when we (the first group of students ""brought up"" on Roberts English) appeared in his class and didn't know the first thing about grammar. He had to start all over, subject-verb-predicate. I still don't know the parts of speech. Whatever you do, DO NOT teach Roberts English!"
__label__1,"What's with all the good reviews?: This is where the band as well as most 80's bands began to commercialize their sound. This is rock music.. plain and simple and this has nothing to make this considered metal. Sorry, but I don't see what the fuss is about...this CD sucked. Anthrax with Joey Belladonna is where the band really shined and was real metal. Yeah, I admit the whole rap thing sucked horribly but still for the most part Anthrax was truly heavy band with Joey but with John...they really slowed down."
__label__2,"Haunting and Beautiful: Even if it didn't have so many extra layers of resonance, given the post-Sept. 11 setting in New York, this would still be one of the most gorgeous and haunting releases in recent memory. The old and new material blend perfectly and gain extra immediacy and depth from their arrangement for this excellent four-person band. Buy it, turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and enter a unique musical (and lyrical) world."
__label__2,"Totally fun read - mad cap characters and hot loving: This is a totally unique novel where the characters are one of a kind and unlike any character I have seen in print or on TV.Laugh out loud humor throughout. The loving is totally hot and tremendously well written.At over 500 pages the author was able to fully explore the personalities and quirks of the main characters and satisfy every reader's needs.At the end of the story you wish both characters well and do hope that they live, as the saying, 'Happily Ever After'."
__label__2,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?: I love this camera! Bought it to replace my DSLR-like Panasonic DMC-FZ10. The pictures it takes BLOWS away my old Panny and not because of 10 megapixel vs 4, but because of the USABLE ISO settings! I took indoor shots at Christmas this year using no flash what-so-ever and using ISO 1600. With my old camera, the images would've been so dark and grainy that they wouldn't have been usable. With this camera, the pictures are great, crisp and have just a little motion blur in them, not to mention a GREAT DOF! The kit lens isn't the greatest (I'm saving up to buy a lens with a similar focal length but with built-in image stabilization), but it's a good start. Get this camera, use the kit lens for a while until you can afford to buy some really nice glass and you will have one AWESOME setup! :D"
__label__2,"The best suspense thriller: I read or listen to 75-100 books per year. I originally read this book in hardcover when it was first published and thought it was the best of its genre that I had ever read. I just re-read the book. I enjoyed it even more the second time. I have read all of Hunter's books that feature the hero of this book, Bob Lee Swagger, and those that feature his father Earl. All of them are entertaining. This one is the best. It has great characters and clever plot twists. If you like thrillers, read this one. You will be hard pressed to find a better read."

Unfortunately, like most modern vacuums, it is made entirely of plastic. I repaired it under the warranty three times. The fourth time that it broke I tossed it. It was no longer worth my trip to the repair shop every 4-6 months to get it fixed."

__label__1,"Not for string playing...: As recently reviewed for 'Fingerboard Tape: Yellow' don't buy this to use on a stringed instrument. It doesn't stick for long and when it does, it takes the varnish off of the neck of the violin when you remove it. No good for anyone who rents an instrument at least... I don't think it is a product specifically designed for string playing... perhaps for a painter or artists."

__label__2,"Great, easy, versatile.: I've used dozens of ball heads. I needed a quick, cheap replacement for my tripod head that just broke. This one came well rated, but I was willing to take the chance. Glad I did. I works well - should get 4 stars, but my only complaints are that the 1/4"" mount on the bottom is really a 3/8"" mount with a little converter - If I lose that little bit, I have a useless head AND the grip doesn't grip so well once you have a heavier camera (imagine a mid-range zoom, flash or pocket wiz, batteries, cable, etc.), but it remains mostly sturdy. I find I'm able to sight in my shot with the hand-trigger held, then I slowly release to lock it in - no problems there. The screw mount on the tripod needs to be occasionally re-tightened which is annoying while you're working, but alleviated by adding some cheap foam to give the head something to stick to."
__label__2,"Splendid Book: What a great story! I expected a regular biography/history of Adoniram Judson, but found myself caught up in an adventure like no other. Author Rosalie Hunt did herself proud in this gripping account of America's first missionary and his three wives, all of whom were perfectly suited for Judson as well as the tasks ahead. Bless God and Take Courage is one of the best books I have ever read and I am looking forward to Hunt's next book."
__label__2,"Great Book, Soon to Be - Great Movie: Michael Shaara may not be as good a writer as father, but he surely comes close to it in his prequel to his father's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Killer Angels. In Gods and Generals, Michael Shaara explores the lives of Generals Lee, Hancock, Jackson and Chamberlain. It delves into their thoughts, actions, remembrances leading up to the battle at Gettysburg. He shows them as people not as unknown figures talked about in boring history classes. People who had feelings, yearnings, and fear.One does not need to be a Civil War buff to thoroughly enjoy this book. It could have been longer because so many battles are included, but then this may have made the book tedious to read.The movie comes out in 2003. If it is as good as the book, it will be a winner."

__label__2,"Great read: To Lois Lane, et. all:How would you have written this biography, sans the quotes from the people who knew him best? The form inherently lends itself to this technique, as any journalist will assure you.The comparison between Evanier and McCullough is irrelevant. They are two completely different animals.Glad I didn't take your misguided attempt at egalitarianism for gospel. I would've missed a great book, one I highly recommend to other Darin fans."

__label__1,"BIG disappointment: I was very excited to buy my kindle and even purchased three books to be on it when it arrived. The unit came on just fine but I could not see any of the content I purchased, even though I had paid for it. I called the help number and spoke to a very nice man who tried for over an hour but did not know how to fix it. He said he would have some ""development people look into it"" but I have not heard anything. While I was waiting for the man to help me, I was reading the book that I had already started. It made me wonder why I was bothering. In any case, it was disappointing because I fell for the advertisement about it being simple and easy but it was nothing of the sort. They need to make help more available and they need to respond much more quickly to people who have problems or they will lose a lot of business."

I have never left a review before in my life, but I would hate for my worst enemy to buy this machine. I am going to carry it out and put it by the curb right now."
__label__2,"Difficult but indispensable: This book treads roughly the same ground as Mark S. Smith's The Early History of God and The Origins of Biblical Monotheism. It is a tour de force of historical reconstruction from biblical sources. It deals with many of the thorny problems of the disparate historical books of the Bible (Chronicles and Joshua-2Kings). It includes the crucial paper on the dual redaction of the Deuteronomic History (Deuteronomy and Joshua-2 Kings). That paper alone is worth the purchase of the book, because it has been so influential over the years. Furthermore, he shreds the fashionable Jebusite hypothesis regarding the origins of Zadok, David's high priest, although his own theory has holes as well.In order to fully appreciate this book you will need a solid grounding in Biblical Hebrew grammar, ancient Near Eastern history and mythology, and Biblical literature. Some of his discussions get extremely technical regarding paleography, epigraphy, and West Semitic grammar."
__label__2,Good book: I liked this book because I love the series it just keeps twisting and turning with surprises everywhere it's a great book
__label__2,"My favorite move of all time: I love John Hughes and I love the brat pack, and I have to say this movie is WAY better than all of the others. And it's not just those who graduated in the 80s who haven't seen this movie who're locked in a cave, but ANYONE who has not seen Club is culturally deprived and should seek help imediately."

__label__2,"CREEPY!!!!! Stephens King's Best!: Now I'm only 13 but i'm a very quick reader and got through this book in 4 days. Mostly cuz it's so good it just draws you in. I've never read any book like like it. It's just- WOW! (He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees the ghost.)It is an epic of how love and friendship will triumph. But one of the bests parts are the villians to be more specific Henry Bowers and the all famous Pennywise the Clown. Henry was great becuase it shows true evil in not a monster but a human. He was perfectly sane just evil. Then comes It itself. Most horror novels have traditional villians (monsters, vampires, demons, etc.) but It is of something else it is the personification of your worst fears it can be anything you picture it as. That what makes it scary if you aren't afraid of vampires 'Salem's Lot would be no breeze but if you have a fear that is what It will become. Truly disturbing."

__label__2,"Great applied book, helping maneuvering ethical issues for managers!: I read the book and, then, decided to use it as complementary reading in my teaching of a governance and ethics. The reading would help managers ""connect the dots"" between their actions and the ethical implications of how they navigate ethical dilemmas. It does not offer a foundational understanding of ethics, and one would need to have that before reading the book. However, that is not the intention of the book; rather, it develops as a conversation with the reader about everyday decisions of managers and their implications to those surrounding managerial decisions. Excellent book."

__label__2,"The Most Original Band of the New Millennium: The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are a superb mix of The Gang of Four, The Velvet Underground, Mazzy Star and The Pretenders, with their own original twist to make the mix new and fresh. Karen O's vocals are compelling, and perfectly matched by the spare back up of the guitarist and drummer. The EP is brilliant, and superbly recorded; all the cuts are excellent, but my favorites are probably BANG and OUR TIME. Why on earth can't these folks get a major label deal? Why aren't they ruling the charts? Without a doubt, the most original pop band to come along since the early Ramones and Stooges, and a band that should be experienced live if at all possible. Without a doubt, this is one of the most influential and important groups in recent memory; an essential purchase."
__label__1,"All My Life: I apologize for this review in advance because I really like Maysa, but I was disappointed with this album. I searched the other reviews to see if anyone felt the same way that I did, but up to this point, I guess I'm the only one.I usually try to listen to tracks before I purchase a cd, but I loved her 1st album and the work she does with Incognito, so I rushed out and purchased it after hearing one of the songs on the radio. That ended up being the ONLY song that I liked. I was SO surprised at this cd.This is more of an r&b type of cd. But she has such a great vocal style when she's varying her range in jazz compositions, that the r&b compositions seemed to suppress her true talent.I'm still a fan of Maysa, but I'm not a fan of this album."

__label__1,"Terrible: To put it in short, this movie is just terrible. I saw some of Clint Eastwood's other films, which I thought was of high standard. There was no character development in this movie, no depth and it follows a typical recipe, which so many other war movies followed in the past. It leaves no excitement and doesn't stay in one's thoughts afterwards."

__label__2,"The best Lost World easily.: Out of the three versions of Conan Doyle's masterpiece this is still the best and though the dinosaurs look out-dated now they are far better and more realistic than in the 1960 and 1992 versions.A team of explorers led by the excellently-portrayed Professor Challenger set off to find a plateau in South America where dinosaurs, in isolation from the outside world, have escaped extinction and still live on. They finish up bringing one of the creatures back to London where it escapes and causes havoc. (Both these plots were new ideas back then, and have been ripped off countless times since).Not only a visual treat, this is a piece of cinematic history and is certainly far more watchable than that special-effects-laden bore of the same name. Get hold of a copy of this 1925 classic now!"

In the end the only thing intriquing was (re)Greit's laundry list. The detail of it read like a Melville Novel. For an interesting heroine and wonderful word tapestries read Ahab's wife: The Star Gazer. As for the pearl earring save the jacket."

__label__1,"Lovely to look at; horrible to follow...: I've been exercising and dancing religiously for years and years, and am familiar with most dance moves. However, this workout requires you to be able to incorporate multiple, relatively complex combinations in a very short time. People who buy a workout tape are using it to get exercise, not learn how to dazzle their friends, so it shouldn't be so hard, you can't do it. I've tried this at least 4 times with the same response; after the first 10 minutes, I get frustrated and switch it with another one.

Why skip over some of the buried gems from ""Self-Portrait"" or ""Saved,"" stuff that really needs to see the light of the public day? The first disc is entirely '60's material, leaving the 70's, 80's and 90's to be crammed onto the second disc. It's nice to have singles like ""Positively 4th St."" and ""Things Have Changed"" in one package, but where's ""Slow Train Coming?"" Where's ""Shooting Star?"" Where's ""Dignity"" even? Try ""Biograph"" or all of the greatest hits if you need an anthology. Bob is a prophet and his music timeless, but as far as 'essentials' go, this really doesn't do it."

That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD."

__label__2,Halloween sing a long: This is such a cute children's DVD. My kids watch it over and over again every Halloween and love to sing along. It's a little annoying for the adults but it keeps our kids happy and gets them in the Halloween Spirit!!!
__label__2,Nice: Now I have a few different size metal stays. I am more conscious to remove them. No more digging around to find proper-sized plastic stays that haven't been mutilated.
__label__2,"Nice Spray Pattern: The unit has a nice spray pattern, however, it is almost impossible to the insert the ""round"" handheld head into the fixed ""horseshoe"" head without causing the fixed head to move. It would be better if the opening in the fixed head was a little wider. Also, I had to wrap the threads of the connections between both heads and the diverter with teflon tape to stop them from leaking."
__label__2,Fun and informative: Great learning device for those interested in reading about every aspect of wine. Well-written and highly recommended.
__label__2,Good Blu Ray: This movie has made a good transfer to Blu Ray had very good quality picture for an older movie and great sound.Worth buying on blu ray over dvd.And also a very clever movie with plot twists which keep you guessing and are just slightly unbelievable but generally quite entertaining.A few topless scenes in this movie including a very quick flash of male nudity too.
__label__2,"Enthralling: Anyone who doesn't like this book, just can't handle it! You'll find yourself confused at the beginning- that's good, but by the end you're living the characters, and taking part in the novel. This is the kind of book that grips you, and doesn't let you stop thinking about it.Cyber stuff is good... Punk is good... Hmm cyberpunk... Why didn't I think of that?"
__label__1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK: This book is based completly on an on-line quiz. My wife bought this book for me used and they will not let me take the quiz. I talked with customer support and they told me to buy a new book making my current book useless.
__label__1,"Best Keep As A Secret: This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast), close to nonexistence suspense, and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog (English accents and all that). Gielgud's performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional (when you can understand his delivery); as the heroine, Carroll's ""acting"" ranges from chatty to zombie; and Lorrie's delivery is over-the-top ham (and, quite frankly, an embarrassment) as he portrays the ""good-guy"" killer. All this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer, Robert Young. Young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film. He makes the film his own!There are some gee-wiz (for the time, 1936) special in-camera/editing effects which were then fast becoming (and would continue to be) a Hitchcock trademark.Not one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but not one of his disasters either.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D"
__label__2,"Great book About Edisto Island!: My family visits Edisto Island every spring, and on one of our trips, I found this wonderful book! I loved learning about the Island's history and the stories were very well written. I stayed up late every night because I always wanted to read more! This book will really hit home if you have ever been to Edisto."
__label__1,"Not That Great: I was not even sweating at the end of this workout - I found the moves to be out of synch - they did not flow easily from one to another - I was a dancer and fitness instructor for years and I found these moves very uncoordinated. The weights were picked up and put down too many times during the workout also, detracting from any consistent and steady fat-burning cardio session. Try Denise Austin's cardio-kickboxing workout - you can use light weights with this too for an even better workout."
__label__1,"I've seen 6 year olds make high quality videos: Let's ignore the fact that for some reason there is no Blu-ray available. The video and audio quality on this DVD rivals a VHS tape from 1980 that's been watched about 500 times. If these are the actual network broadcasts, then they must have been recorded with someone's cell phone while standing in front of the TV. I can't believe this is official NFL merchandise. Save yourself some money and go watch video highlights of these games for free on Youtube. You'll be much more impressed at the production value."
__label__2,"Worthwhile purchase: With the birth of our third baby, we decided to upgrade our monitor to this, the Sumer Day & Night handheld monitor. With our previous two children we used the Summer Day & Night (non-handheld) monitor. The picture on the handheld version seems to be a lot clearer and the convenience of being able to carry around the monitor is worth every penny. The sound quality is unbeatable - we can even hear our baby breathing through our monitor. The only negatives we can say about this product is that the other (non-handheld) monitor is not compatible with the new camera. Also, the size of the monitor (1.8) could stand to be a bit bigger, but the next size up (the 2.5 screen size) is a ridiculous jump in price. That being said, I would highly recommend this monitor."
__label__2,"My copy is orange with highlighted phrases.: Forever, I've had the habit of highlighting poignant phrases in whatever I read. Now, after reading Feather in the Wind, my copy is practically orange with highlights. This book is chock full of interesting and profound, unusual and touching literary jewels. For instance, on page 139, ""He screamed. It was a cry more wild, more mournful and lonesome than that of any wolf, and it pierced the night air and roamed the dark countryside in unrequited pursuit of an answering call."" Doesn't that grab you?Author J.D.H. Duncan definitely has a way with words and expressions that sets him apart. This romance novel provokes both tears and laughter as it takes you through the incredible trials and tribulations of an ordinary man living an extraordinary life of pain and love all mixed up with humor and hope and lessons in life. Just read the book, and don't forget your highlighter pencil!"
__label__1,"N'Sync Tried too Hard: I really thought this was going to be a good c.d., but it really wasn't good at all. They tried to come out with a harder edge, but all that came out was a bunch of white boys trying to rap. I'm sorry, but it sounds like techno-pop and is not good at all. Songs like ""Space Cowboy"" are stupid. I have not met one person who likes ""Space Cowboy"" (even the diehard *NSYNC fans hate it.) If I could return this c.d., I would."
__label__2,Potter Fan: J.K Rowling is an excellent story teller. This is my second time reading this book and it was just as enjoyable as the first time.
__label__2,"Good DVD: It's a good DVD, however the sound quality as some people have suggested, is not the greatest. I have heard better quality sound on Peter Gabriel Concert DVD which was recorded way back in 1994. They should have done a better sound recording on this concert.. and I would love to hear it in DTS."
__label__2,"enlightening and entertaining: I have enjoyed reading Walking the Bible and Abraham by Bruce Feiler as well as some of his earlier books. So naturallyI did not want to miss reading Where God Was Born. Once again I was not disappointed. What a wonderful way to ""travel"" and Bruce makes a wonderful tour guide. He has great insight and knowledge of the areas he visits as well as the ability to make it a terrific read. This is another ""don't miss"" book by a wonderful author."

__label__2,White Christmas DVD: My mom and I would watch this movie every year when I was growing up. It just did not seem like Christmas until we watched White Christmas.
__label__2,"Unnplugged and the spine...: The Album represents the instrument of composition in the DMB. The guitar, especially the acoustic guitar. It's bare bones and all you need to hear the brilliant talent within. Plain and simple."
__label__1,"Not worth the money: This movie is just not up to par with other antimated movies out there. Even with Depp's voice, if he would have stared in a real movie like this it would have been his bigest flop."
__label__2,"pretty good: This blood pressure monitor works well as described. Appears to be reliable values. Only problem I had was the arm cuff, when slide on, made a very long scratch mark that created a nice scar ..."
__label__1,Milking It...: Seems to me the authors of the Left Behind series are milking it for everything it's worth. I've been a loyal fan of the series but The Remnant was very disappointing. It left me wondering how I'd get through another year (and two more books) of the Tribulation.

__label__2,"Definately worth the money!: Definately lives up to the NEED FOR SPEED name! While it might not offer the mind blowing graphics the PS3 is capable of, watching your customized lambo fly through the air at 100mph in slow motion is pretty nice on any decent TV. If you love racing games, or even running from 90 cop cars in Z06 vettes with spike strips and ramming suv's ahead of you, then your gonna love this. Plus once you finish your career mode there are still more cars to unlock by playing online and completing challenge races. Check it out for yourself!"
__label__2,"Pleased: I love Lilac Vegetal. My father used it. My barber used it (when I had more for a barber to work with). I grew to love it. It has a light, subtle, elegant and sophisticated nose. I find it very masculine. It is not for everyone but there is no fragrance that is. The comments associating LV with urine are ridiculous. It would not be around nearly two hundred years later if it did. It is always well-received by others.I had been nursing along a bottle that I've had for several years thinking it was extinct so I was very pleased to find that this product is still available online because it is impossible to find in stores."
__label__2,"Loads of fun: I love the Stephanie Plum books they are fun with just enough suspene to maket them a true delight. Janet Evanovich is an excellent writer, I would recommend her books to anyone. I love ecom and ease of buying and receiving a Kindle book."
__label__2,Glad I bought it: I like it --- it's sort of campy but very entertaining! Call it a guilty pleasure --- haven't been through all of the shows yet but like what I have viewed.
__label__1,"You're kidding.... RIGHT?: This thing is very comfortable, for the week or so that it works! Like some of the other reviewers, and other people I know that own these, the Z button is a BIG problem. After the week or so that I said it will work, the Z button caves in, and there is no real way to get it out. I tried taking it apart. and it didn't really help. The rest of the controller, however, was better than the original. But many games can't be played (at least to their fullest) without the Z button! It might be more comfortable and accessible, but it's still a horrible product! What a joke. InterAct should be ashamed. FOR GOD SAKES, BUY THE REAL CONTROLLER!!!"
__label__1,"Actually 0 stars: Don't waste your money. This book was useless. I just returned from my trip on Route 66 and never once found this book useful. I suggest Route 66 Adventure Handbook, by Knowles and highly recommend Traveling Route 66, by Freeth. The last a great traveling companion helps figure out mileage and what to see."
__label__2,"A MUST-BUY!!!: Great movie. Being an amature poker player, I had no IDEA I'd be so riveted to what was a really fascinating social commentary on life, drive, ambition, family & the American dream. It's a compelling story as much as a fun ride! And I learned a whole lot more about poker."

__label__1,"terrible: Well let me start off by saying, I am a pretty small person with pretty small features. I always have an issue with things like, say, hats... normal sizes are generally a bit too big and children's sizes are way too small. I tried these headphones on and they were WAY TOO BIG. Too wide. They don't hug my head or my ears at all. They just kind of sit there. And if I moved at all they would just flop off of my head. This makes the noise cancelling feature pointless because the ear parts weren't on my ears correctly. I read a review about children wearing them... well, they must not be picky children. I know how a good pair of headphones is supposed to feel, and this certainly is not it."
__label__2,"Absolutely, wonderful costume for the money...: Costume is very well made and will last through many days of playing ""Scooby Dooby Doo"". Size is close to childrens clothing, might want to go one size up if child fits into clothing perfectly. Would definately purchase other costumes from this maker/seller again."
__label__1,"Didn't work for me: I've suffered with terrible acne since I was about 11 years old. I've tried just about everything under the sun to help clear up my skin with minimal success. This product didn't seem to do anything for me in terms of clearing up my skin. I'm giving it two stars because although it didn't clear my skin up, it also didn't make it worse or cause any other odd side effects. I guess this product could be worth a try if you're also suffering from acne, it just wasn't for me."
__label__2,"Hypnotic: A quiet, surreal, psychological horror story. There is much to contemplate in this tale of an entomologist, the woman with whom he is imprisoned, and the savage villagers who derive both their livelihood and a twisted sense of pleasure from the couple's predicament. It says much about the ambivalence that many Japanese feel toward society: on one hand, they feel a sense of obligation to sublimate their own needs to those of the group; on the other, there is a deep sense of resentment and a feeling that they are not properly appreciated for their sacrifices. The only flaw with this film is that it sometimes belabors the point."
__label__1,"door too small: Very easy to put together and it looks really nice...BUT...the doorway is 5"" from the bottom and most litter boxes are taller than that so there is not enough room for my cat to get through the door."
__label__1,"C'mon people....use common sense! There is no ""cure""!: This guy is making ridiculous claims that are completely false in order to sell books to people desperate to lose weight. We ALL wish there was some magic cure, but there is not. Period. The sooner people accept this, and start eating less and exercing more, the sooner crooks like this guy will go out of business."
__label__2,"Cheap and does the job but one catch: It's a great cheap memory card if you don't need speed. It's not going to be as fast as say a SanDisk UltraII or something. I give it 4 stars because the way the card came formatted from the factory, it wasn't recognized in a few of my devices. They should have stated this in the documentation. I ended up formatting it in my PC and it was just fine."
__label__1,"VGN-140P is very easy to break comparing to others: I broguth VGN-140P from ecom last March, but it alreay have broken twice already. The first time, 3 months after I brought it, when I was on a trip to asia, the LCD broke without warning (cracked), since I was outside of the US, I had to pay for the repair on my own for over $600 to replace the LCD. Now it broke again. This time, the computer will be freezen whenever I move the computer. I reformat the disk and install the system several time, no help. I had a Vaio SK notebook for over 4 years, it is still worked very well, heavily used, not easy to break at all. But this VGN-140P is so easy to break, I like the size, but I don't like the quality and the reliability. I have 3 notebooks all of them are sony, but not anymore, I am going to get a new one, not SONY for sure. Maybe Panasonic Roughbook should be better than Vaio."

__label__1,"Mild Miles: 2 1/2Entrenched Eighties production would be forgivable if there was more substance to the songwriting but this sadly remains a mainly tired affair, offering acceptable trumpet lines over casio-toned production, though not without a share of noteworthy moments amidst the onslaught of fusion caricature."
__label__2,"So far, so good: I am very satisfied with this product so far. I'm expecting a baby, and I purchased this for extra storage room for his clothes. It was very easy to put together; I did it myself at 8.5 months pregnant! It was very light weight, no tools are required for assembly and it is easy to maneuver. There is also plenty of room in the bottom of the unit for extra storage bins, a shoe rack, etc. The only thing I wish it had was 2 hanger bars instead of 1. Overall I definitely think I got a good product for the purchase price."
__label__1,"Danger - Warning - Does Not Work When You Need It: Do not rely on Norton Ghost 9.0 if you ever need to recover a primary disk drive. It does not work to recover a Windows XP Primary Drive (the one you boot from) to a replacement drive in most situations. If you have read the Help that comes with the software you know more than their technical support folks that are located in India (the one I spoke with was very difficult to understand). Symantec's knowledge base is very limited and of little help, mostly just repeating information in the product Help. Recommend you find a different solution that works."
__label__2,"It really did help.: The REA book helped a lot with preparing for the CLEP exam. The actual CLEP exam was much different from the practice exams in REA's book. It would help the study process if REA updated the three practice exams in the book, and included all three of those exams on the accompanying CD, instead of only the first two exams. An earlier reviewer pointed out that there were some errors in the REA book. I noted the same errors and found that there were several additional errors throughout the book. The CLEP book would benefit a lot from being proofread and from having the errors corrected. Overall, it is my opinion that the REA book is very helpful with passing the CLEP exam, and I highly recommend purchasing the book."
__label__1,"Worst movie I've seen in years: I couldn't wait to see this movie - now I'm very sorry I did. It was nothing but filthy language, bad situations and obnoxious people. As far as I could tell there was nothing redeeming about it at all."
__label__2,Absolutely the most fun educational toy I have ever seen!: Every child who comes to our house & plays this game is hooked and asks to play next time. I am a teacher by profession and this is a very unintimidating logic & reasoning game (for all ages)- I would highly recommend! I have just ordered 5 more to give as x-mas gifts this year.
__label__2,"For people who love Novas, they will love this book!: I own a 1973 Nova SS, and this book told me the history on my baby, along with how the Nova became famous. This book will give a beginner all the info they need to know and let the enthusiests in on a couple of secrets. I definately enjoyed this book! For any person who loves Novas will love this book!"
__label__1,"You can skip this one.: Great for the beginner I am sure. If you have been around, played, or talked about the game...or have a general idea of the game...you can skip this one. There is much better material out there to be obtained and absorbed. After reading this...you can sit at a small stakes game and not lose quickly...but you will not win...and if you do...it won't be very much. Concepts are simple and basically will make a ""weak"" player out of you. Nothing more, nothing less. Of all the poker books I have obtained, this by far is the only real disappointment."
__label__1,"Do Not Buy If You Intend To Resell...: Once again despite purchasing this item from ecom, the listing is blocked so you cannot resell items. I used to purchase many movies that looked interesting with the assurance that any I didn't really care for could be resold, even if at a slight loss.These new ecom restrictions will change my purchasing habits for sure."
__label__1,Wrong product: I thought I was ordering White Linen. When it arrived it was White Linen Breeze. I had to return it.
__label__1,"Hoping for better: Why can't John Grisham return to his original form of The Firm? Obviously The Summons was written as a character study and not a thriller. Usually I like that kind of novel, but this was extremely slow as we learned about the lives of The Judge, Ray Atlee, Forrest Atlee and several others who interacted with them. The plot is woven together with a thin thread - a father's death, the finding of questionable money and subsequent erratic guarding of it, worry about Forrest and his pitiful lifestyle, and Ray Atlee's irrational antics comprise the plot. It doesn't take much to figure out the ending which is dismal and predictable, but of course open for a sequel. This ends my buying a Grisham novel again unless it is in paperback. Maybe a library loan would be better!"
__label__2,"Ladybug Land is Great: We loved this gift. Our four-year-old twin girl received it as a gift. We filled out the egg order form in her own name, so she was super excited when the package arrived in the mail with her own name on it. She would call me at work to tell me what the ladybugs larvae were doing, and was ecstatic the day we released the mature ladybugs into our backyard garden."
__label__1,Slow service: I would tell you how I liked this product if I had actually received it.I just hope I receive it before my son graduates (3 weeks) so that I can give it to him as a graduation present. I took a chance with an outside vendor and paid the extra shipping only to be dissappointed by toooo slow of service.
__label__2,"Funny.........: I thought this book was funny! They have escaped Huitzilopoctl, met Merlin fought with Vikings in this book. Christopher adds humor and sarcasm to almost anything. This book in the series is one of my favorites!"
__label__1,Disappointing sound and broke after 6 months.: I don't get all the great reviews. When I first got these I intended to return them but never got around to it. They just broke after 6 months and I only used them in the gym 4 days a week for an hour or so. They aren't terrible but sound tinny. I only paid $10 for them so I didn't expect greatness but I can't say that these sound better than the stock ipod buds.
__label__1,"Weak Sauce.: Honestly, I feel that this was written for the spiritually immature. This book has no real insight and does nothing to inspire anything more than the most superficial exploration of faith and love."
__label__2,"Excellent Waffle Maker: I read many reviews about waffle makers before choosing the Krupps. I am not disappointed. The waffles come out light, fluffy and do not stick at all. Clean up is a snap as the parts can be placed in the dishwasher. You may pay more for this waffle maker but you get what you pay for. We have been using this waffle maker for approximately one month. However, the waffle maker seems sturdy and appears it will hold up to years of use. I recommend the Krups FD912 Expert Waffle Maker with Rotary System to anyone who loves waffles!"

These reality horror fans alienate gore films, but did you know, that gore is a real thing! I don't belong to any genre of horror, but to be honest, this [is bad]. It is a waste of time. It's boring! There is nothing scary about this reality genre. It's an excuse used by the directors, because in reality they couldn't deliver any shocks, or scares. That is the reality of reality horror films. They [are bad], and that's all there is to it. Don't buy it. Thank you for saving yourself from a mindless boring movie like this one. ..."
__label__2,"Great solution for the pantry!: Coming back to buy a second rack for the pantry we liked the first so much. Very nice construction and holds a good amount of cans. Love that its adjustable so I can customize the cans I want to put on each level. A few tips if you're thinking of buying one: 1) if you have wire shelving, prepare to put something underneath it to make it more stable (we have a heavy piece of cardboard under ours), 2) Make sure your shelf has the proper support, this thing gets heavy when fully loaded! Overall, very happy with this purchase! I know a lot of people were concerned about size: Our wire pantry shelving is 18"" deep and there is 16"" between our shelves and this rack fit perfectly. Fits more cans than I expected!"
__label__1,"Total Disappointment: This ""talking head"" video covers all the topics of boating, but provides little or no useful information you can take with you on the water. It is well produced but void of real content. I was very disappointed in it and would not recommend its purchase to anyone.The format throughout is a woman lecturing. She does a fine job of reading the scripts, but I expected much more from a DVD. Topics like trailering, docking, knots, navigation, and more would have been excellent if actual video of boats had been used to demonstrate. Instead, its just 3 hours of a nice lady lecturing, and a few marginally useful graphics. This DVD is little more than a book read onto a DVD and much less useful than a book.I'm still looking for a good DVD or video that demonstrates boating tips, as such a video would be very useful to beginners or others."
__label__2,Still one of the best: What a great deck. Add a good cart. and it would be hard to find anything in the market that even approches the value of this deck for audiophile use.

I`ve always listened to prog rock and prog metal and i kind of looked down at Goth (what a fool I`ve been )This band deliver great melodic music and have the best female vocals that i have heard (sorry The Gathering)To top it of Cristina Scabbia is also very beautiful.But there is just one thing Andrea Ferro ,his voice is Gruffand in a couple of songs he sounds out of place, but other times he works well , I think all vocals should be up to Cristina to decide since her performance gets a gold star.Get this CD ,buy it second hand if you must, but get it!"
__label__1,"HEY!! WHERE'S THE WORKBOOK??: Just purchased this video, began to watch it, and realized that it requires the ""Learn Math Quickly"" workbook. This workbook is not offered by (this site). Without the workbook, the video is useless as the video's instructor asks the viewer repeatedly to refer to it and perform tasks in it. Could be worth more than one star, but I guess I'll never know!!"
__label__1,"I am bored......: ILL beats. DECENT rhymes. DMX doesn't really have much to say. how many times can a person say where my dogs at?IN all this album is ILL if you like partying, but it showed not a bit of insight.For those of you who like to listen to versitile rap, DMX is NOT your man. ON this album he talks about the same thing every other rapper does, weed, sex, killing(of course he has a couple of tracks where he tries to come off like a decent man).BEWARE! When you first hear the album you will be enticed by the ILL beats-this is what happened to me. I copped the album from a friend, took it home, played it and then realized that the brother had no REAL lyrical skills-it was strickly beats. I give DMX props in that area because without the beats, he's pretty much outdone by REAL rhymers such as CANIBUS, RAKIM, NAS, etc.peacemic-12"
__label__2,"Beyond Amazing!!!: The spontaneous raw intensity of this album gives it an almost live feel (but without the fumbles and poor sound quality of most bootlegs). It's dark, soulful, bluesy, and atmospheric, and contains some of Van's best vocal work--each word conveys soooo much emotion. I listened to nothing else for almost a week after buying this album. This album is what music should be; a definate must-have for any Van fan."
__label__1,"DO WE REALLY NEED THIS BOOK: The first 50 or so pages made me think that this had all be said before. Countless books have been written about Adams, now this one adds nothing new to the collection. Truman was a great book by McCullough with lots of new and interesting info, but this one is a dud, not worth the money and a absolute bore. Best used as a paperweight."
__label__1,"Blechhhh......: Basically a 2 week recount of a drunken binge in the French Quarter after Katrina. Women probably want to avoid this as the author is clearly an egotistical mysogynist.The author at one point participates in looting then later on has the decency to assist the police when others are looting. Whatta guy.Many others lost their lives, families and homes during Katrina. Mr. Smallwood lost his ability to party in the French Quarter and was kind of enough to share his pain with the rest of the world through this sorry excuse for a book. Boo-hoo.Oh yeah...note to Mr. Smallwood. Christian Science is not the same thing as Scientology. Jeez, check your facts."

__label__2,"Great Movie. some things were historically off: I really enjoyed this movie. I am really big on the ancient Picts. and I do like the way they were portrayed in this movie. The only thing I found was wrong was that Agrolica was not around during the time of Hadrian. He was around during the time of Dominantion and had died in 96AD. this story took place during 117AD. I liked the fight scenes and the mind set of how the Picts thought. I know the Romans are supposed to be the good guys, but I understand why the Picts were the way they were. They didn't want to be told how to live their lifes and the Romans couldn't see that."
__label__2,Good buy for the price: Worked pretty well as I was looking for something to handle our 22 lb turkey. Product said up to 18lbs but thought I would give it a try. Made for most of the cooking until finally tipping over. Received product within 2 days of ordering as I waited until the last minute. Was very appreciative of that.

__label__2,"Excellent Interpretaions of Two Shostakovich symphonies: If you like the Russian composers as I do, you will definitely like these two recordings of Shostakovich's 5th and 6th symphonies.Prior to ordering this CD, I spent an inordinate amount of time reading reviews here on ecom.com and elsewhere, trying to determine which recordings in particular would give me the enjoyment I was looking for. Some people recommended recordings by friends of the composer; others had their favorite orchestras. I kind of split the difference between favorites and old, choosing this recording done by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic as I wanted a distinctly Russian interpretation of a Russian composer. I was not disappointed.Highly recommend!"
__label__2,"Another winner: The Zoboomafoo video series are a big hit in our house - the opening music is enough to get both kids leaping like lemurs! Zoboo himself is like a furry 5 year old - curious and silly, with flashes of brilliant insight. The videos are well done, and are entertaining to adults as well as to kids, even on the ""umpteenth"" viewing. The information contained in the videos is accurate without being pedantic, and the enviro-friendly messages are not overbearing. Any/all of the videos should be a part of a kids collection."
__label__2,"Talking all night long: I sat up all night. I talk to this beautiful lady I met all night long while this, and a few other few slow jams played.. I can tell you if you are in the mood to sip wine, talk about life, and get closer to someone toss this cd on the spinner, and open your mind. If you want to hear something that is close, goto mp3, look up ""d.a. young"" and listen to ""father's father's house."" You will not be sorry. =)"
__label__1,"Half-broken.: When I received it, it was half broken, and I managed to glue it back together, this was probably due to bad packaging combined with improper care by postal workers. It took a few months but eventually it stopped working, (After a few more repairs along the way.) I would recommend just buying one from a local store to prevent damage."
__label__2,"loving insight: Such a good read...Tracy Stewart really provides the readers with an interesting yet loving insight into who the man Payne Stewart really was...not only the golfer, but the loving, God fearing family man the public didn't know! What a tragedy for his family to have lost such a wonderfully loving husband, father, son & brother. And what a great loss to the world of golf...Payne Stewart was just coming into his own...a life cut too short."
__label__2,"If You Like Hot Tuna, You Will Like This Album: Why is it some people can't accept that artists move on? Thank God.Who wants to hear the same formula over and over. This album is not a radical departure from 70's era Hot Tuna. I like it also!"
__label__1,"Secrets of the Morning: My ""nearly new"" book was yellow and had water stains. This is the first poor quality book I have ever gotten from ecom. I was very disappointed in the misrepresentation of the book's appearance."
__label__2,"Birds of a Feather: I enjoy anything by this author, Jacqueline Winspear, this book was no different in my enjoyment. Winspear does research and tells the reader about England at the close of WWI, something citizens of other countries probably wouldn't know. It brought into sharp focus for me the injuries to fighters in any war and the responsibility of each country to take care of the veterans who live with the results of their injuries for the rest of their lives. I especially admire how she used the feather significance in the plot in her title. I look forward to reading her next story."

I wanted something he can grow with and what more could you ask for than a sports theme? I couldn't be happier with the way his room turned out once we got everything put together. I find myself just sitting in his room admiring how cute it all is. We can't wait until he is born (December) and are able to see him grow with this adorable, yet boyish bedroom!!!"
__label__1,dated and basic: This is not what I expected. More about running meetings than anything else.The section on how to use overhead projectors should have been a clue to the lack of updates.There are a few good random speaking tips from experts at the end.

__label__1,"Grizzly could NOT possibly have made this hood.: Compared to other Grizzly designed products, this hood falls well short of the mark in terms of finish, but especially FIT. When the hood arrived, it appeared as a piece of thin grade metal, shaped into a tube and painted with black enamel. Instructions were a Zeroxed line drawing. And when I actually attached the hood to the planer, I felt like I had just got taken for one more add on purchase.I'll be designing my own.And I'll paint it Grizzly green."
__label__2,"Great resource!: This book has been well-used during my time in Germany (stationed here with a military husband).

The maps and suggested tours are wonderful!--Vicki Landes, author of ""Europe for the Senses - A Photographic Journal"""
__label__2,"I'm a bit confused by those who find it ""embarrassing"": I can't think of anything more embarassing than dealing with a giant tantrum in public. Go with what works -- and this does!"
__label__2,"Underrated: This album comes in for so much stick, yet when you take it out of the context of Cohen's catalogue, you can see that it is a great album in it's own right. Each song is lush sounding, as though Spector is parodying himself at times with echoing drums wind sections, but the songs are suited to this. I hear after the collaborator's fall out, they were left with only guide vocals, but they more than do their job. Cohen sounds seedy, at times, a little too seedy (I Left A Woman Waiting) but you can't help but admit that this is a great collection of songs and Cohen sounds like he's having fun. Great comedy moments too here, like Bob Dylan's backing vocals on '... Hard On' and the whole everything in one pan aspect gives you the same pleasure as listening to The Clash's London Calling. Something which will appeal to even non-fans"
__label__1,"Worst movie to date!!!!: I just love a good interracial movie. This movie played the race card, which any good IR movie will do... but the also played the Teens-gotta-have-sex-all-of-the-time card. It also played the Gotta-get-high-&-drunk and outcasts-are-the-coolest-people card. I would rather get one pap smear per hour for the rest of my life than watch this movie one more time!!! The only thing the main character did was act like a freaking baby and the male lead, to say he was so smart, was so stupid. He felt he had to clean up all of her messes and in effect almost screwed up his own future. Her father repeatedly tells him that she will (but he won't listen). I waited throughout this entire movie for it to get good..... and it did... in the last 10 seconds. Don't waste your time or money on this one, unless you just loved the movie When a Man loves a Woman (which I also hate)!"
__label__2,"Peter Gabriel Rocks: This is a great compilation of Gabriel's music history. While favoring the recently produced works, there are still the old gems you love form him, like Solisbury Hill. This is a double CD, so there is a lot of music for you to enjoy."
__label__2,"Impress your friends whilst intoxicating them: This is my first cocktail shaker, and I bought it only after reading the other reviews on this website. I am not at all disappointed. The shaker is spacious, which is key when you're making martinis for four people at once. The striking design is certainly a conversation piece, and I don't know which my friends enjoy more: the drinks themselves or watching me make them. The only drawback I can see is that sometimes the strainer piece will become lodged in the ""bullet tip"" cap. . . cold ice not only shrinks the container, but lowers the pressure between capped strainer and bullet tip, creating troublesome suction. For practicality, the bullet tip should be left off when shaking, but it's not that hard to remedy even if it does happen.Five stars!"
__label__2,"Great, but be aware...: I've been using the Chillow for over 5 years. It's not perfect but I've found a way to make it work. First of all, I put it directly on top of my pillow and sleep with my head directly on it. It does not stay cool for the entire night but if you wake up and it's not cool enough, you can rotate it 180 degrees and it will be fine for another few hours.Eventually, small tears appear around the edge of the Chillow. Eventually, they will start leaking. If you examine it every week or so, you can see the tears and put a drop of super glue on them. This will prevent them from leaking. I get about 6 or 8 months out of each one before I reorder. To me the benefits of the chillow far outweigh the downside.I honestly can't imagine sleeping without my Chillow."

'not cheap, by any stretch. but, we decided to stick with it for another bottle's worth just to see.as for the seller, they couldn't have been faster in their delivery. so, we're very pleased with them."
__label__2,"Must Read!: I read the book in one day and was amazed at how much information was in there. The author does not mandate strict ways to become financially independent, rather he offers up some basic financial knowledge, gives you a road map and then lets you decide. An extensive recommended reading list provides a springboard to move forward. If this were required reading for high-school seniors, we would have a lot more wealthy people, regardless of what their income is."
__label__1,"I can take it or leave it...: I saw the musical Wicked in Chicago and absolutely loved it. I immediately went out and bought the book, hoping to see the characters in the musical fleshed out a bit.Instead, I started reading it and was shocked at the explicit scenes. I found myself losing interest. It is not an easy book to read; Maguire uses large words and rambles on instead of explaining.The characters in the book are hard to relate to and sometimes boring. The storyline grew tedious. The only part in this book I truly enjoyed was when Elphaba and her friends were at school. After they left, the book went downhill for me.So many things in this book were left unexplained. I am considering reading the sequel, just to find out what happens, but if I do read it, it will definitely come from the library. I wouldn't buy a book from this author again and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a heavy read and not looking for something even remotely close to the musical."
__label__2,"A performance of a lifetime: To my opinion, Les Miserables is truly one of the greatest musical theater productions i have ever seen and heard.

I love this play and recomend anyone to buy it and own it personally."
__label__2,Judy Moody Predicts the Future: When I read this story I enjoyed it.At first Judy Moody was jealous of Jessica because she got better grades than Judy Moody.Then Judy Moody got a mood ring and predicted the future.She also predicted the future with something that looked like a boling ball.
__label__1,"Not happy: I wish the product description was more upfront. My daughter has been trying to get to the next unit but I'm now afraid you have to pay for the membership. I am not willing to do so when there are plenty of free educational games on the internet. The educational value was too easy for my five year old and there were too many ""fluff"" activities."
__label__2,"A great sequel: The sequel to the first, Hungry Eyes, is almost as good as the first. It's addictive, thrilling, and well written. The characters are strong and easily latched on to (except Shara gets on my nerves a little at times.) A lot happens, and the ending was an incredible finish. An excellent sequel to Hungry Eyes, if you were left wanting more -- this is a great runner up. Even as a stand alone book, Eyes of Prey is a great read with a multitude of social commentaries."
__label__2,"Sick: While this may not be the best funk album out there (there seems to be some disagreement in the reviews below), I think it's a must-own for anyone that's looking for some funk they haven't heard before. The songs are a little lo-fi, and their structures tend to be slightly looser and jazzier than the prototype set forth by James Brown, without ever losing vitality or becoming needlessly long or repetitive like the Meters and Maceo Parker sometimes do.Make no mistake, this is rump-shakin' stuff that will have people at your next party asking you what's playing. Also, the liner notes, which detail the process of uncovering these lost classics, are priceless. The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is that many of the songs lack strong hooks. They more than make up for it with deep grooves, but those who like sing-alongs (like ""I Feel Good"") might feel a little short-changed."
__label__1,"Disappointing to say the least..............: This Lorrie Morgan fan was truly disappointed with the material on ""My Heart"". To be honest, I purchased it the very day it came out and haven't listened to it since (normally a new Lorrie cd does not leave my player). ""Maybe Not Tonight"" IS the best track on the album (and even that is not as good as it should have been) - the rest seem to be missing that emotional connection. Perhaps this album was rushed; or the songs were decided on too quickly. I am still enjoying ""Shakin Things Up"" and it looks like I will continue to listen to that one until Lorrie takes another stab at a quality album of material from start to finish."
__label__2,"meat puppets best ever: simply put, live montana is the best meat puppets album ever. supposedly it is compiled from two of their best live shows, which i have heard could be pretty bad at times, but based on this recording i would love to hear more of their live stuff. the best part of the album is when they segue from track to track not unlike the grateful dead. and to this fan, this stuff is as marvelous as dead segues must be to deadheads. it's just a really goddamn good piece of plastic (or whatever cds are made of). if you've never heard the puppets or are a big fan, but it next chance you get"
__label__2,"Decent case especially for the price.: When I purchased this case for my Makita 9565CV 5"" angle grinder, the description said that it accomodated ALL 4"" to 5"" grinders. When I tried my grinder in the case, it did not fit. I called Makita and was told that this case was for the 4 1/2"" grinder ONLY.I used a heat gun to heat up the plastic and then put the grinder in the case and now it fits like a glove! This can probably be done with other 5"" Makita grinders, but I believe the case would fit the 4"" and 4 1/2"" grinders as described.The case itself is a little different than most Makita cases. It has a place to store the spanner wrench as well as the handle and also a place for grinder discs. It is a good case for the money."
__label__1,"Waste of time: I watched this on pitchfork.tv expecting something truly awesome. There's no Daft Punk music. Throughout most of the movie, there's this awful ticking noise. Yes, I get it. Robots want to be human.I want my 74 minutes back."

__label__1,"Not what I expected: I felt a bit misled with this book. The back cover and inside blurb focused on a lockdown situation, which sounded like a great suspense situation and I was looking forward to reading the book. Then, absolutely nothing happens for the first 300 pages! Basically nothing much at all, just lots of short chapters, and tons of characters, none of which we really get to know well enough to enjoy their company or care about. Then it's in the last 50 pages of the book that we finally get to the lockdown situation, and it's just a letdown, no big drama whatsoever, and the story just fizzled out.I read another book over the weekend, Temporary Sanity by Rose Connors, that honestly blew this one out of the water. She is like a female John Grisham, and you really get to know and care about the people in her book, which is what was missing with this one."
__label__2,A Lifetime Favorite: My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now.
__label__1,"Viewsonic VSATV26324-1W $600+ dollars: This TV/flat panel monitor died right after the warranty ended. The only thing worse was calling the Viewsonic tech support. They were totally useless. Didn't even try to help with any trouble shooting. Would not point me to a schematic, or suggest known parts that fail all the time. They just kept saying look for a repairman in the yellow pages. You might want to consider a company with a good track record for tech support before purchasing your next flat panel."
__label__1,"""No Strings"" won't make it far in this""Millenniuem""...: I bought this CD in hopes that ""No Strings Attached"" would live up to all the hype that's surrounding Nsync right now... man, what a disappointment it turned out to be ! This CD is nothing but a jumbled mess of wanna-be club songs and your occasional boring, over-done love song ! The entire CD sounds like it was intended to be played a middle school dance, so the 6th thru 8th grade crowd will really get a kick out of it ! Nice try, Nsync, but NO thanks ! I'll stick to listening to the Backstreet Boys !"
__label__1,Mediocre: There are about 8-10 good/great songs total on this but the rest is TERRIBLE. Lots of unlistenable over-produced 70s garbage. I bought it for Ton of Dynamite alone as I had the other good songs already. I'd listen to it before you buy it.
__label__2,"A Beautiful, if Brief, Collection: Short stories are hard, for me at least. There has got to be something about a collection that keeps me reading on after finishing one story. Natasha is one of those collections that has several ""things"" that keep me reading. First, the writing is excellent. Bezmozgis has one description right in the first story of spring ariving. The description is brief but at the same time incredibly evocative. With that, he had me hooked. The stories are interesting, particularly in light of the fact that they concern one family and have the same narrator--a young boy who emigrated with his family from Latvia to Canada in the late 70s. Their early struggles and later successes are captured quite beautifully in these stories. Natasha is not a imposing collection; it is a brief, enjoyable read--about 145 pages of well-written, compelling stories."
__label__2,"replete with nuggests of spiritual wisdom: This book is made up of a number of very short chapters covering the foundational issues we all encounter in the spiritual life. Of this series of books, this would not however be my favourite - that goes to ""The wound of love""."

The newer edition is in color and it has become slightly larger, making it easier on the eyes.

I hope the publishers will reconsider bringing this back, while still keeping the bigger sizes for those who would rather have them."

__label__1,"War of the Gay - closet sci-fi at its cheapest!: This film is camper than a Freddie Mercury video! Even the leading man goes for a retro Victorian clone look, and it's pretty obvious that his wife is just a beard to hide his love that dare not speak its name. This film may still be in the closet, but the only thing the main character in this film seems to be fighting is his own sexuality - this film is just reeking with gay subtext. Anthony Piana never misses an opportunity to take off his shirt and grab hold of any good looking guy that comes along, and as another reviewer said, it's almost like they cut the gay sex scenes out at the last minute to try to peddle this to the unsuspecting family audience!!!! It's stomach turningly bad as a movie, but it might just go down with the Rocky Horror/Showgirls crowd. Don't forget to bring the orrnges and the fake biker moustache!"

Thank you Mr. Rubino. I could not be happier that I took your timely advice!"

I heard a rumor that Jodi Foster refused to do the movie despite a record-breaking sum of money because her character was so pathetic. I don't know if it's true, but I don't blame her for a second if it is."

__label__1,"LOW KICKBACK SAFETY CHAIN!: This is a safety chain!!!!Not a standard chain! It is a special low-kickback chain, the kind with the hooked depth guides (the ones that can't be ground down after multiple sharping iterations.)This should absolutely be in the product description, this was a waste of my time.It should be noted that this is the same stock chain that comes with the Husky Rancher 455 and some others. If you are looking for that exact chain (and most people are not) than this is it. Most people have little use for these. ""Rancher"" or ""Farm"" entry type saws typically only have enough power to make kick-back a moderate concern. This same information can be read in your owners manual.

__label__1,"I'm not buying it...: As others have said, this book is awful: there's nothing new here, no real insight into the characters of anyone involved, and the writing is wretched. You won't learn anything new if you read this book.One thing I can add is a little info on the publishing business. A lot of people have scolded Amber Frey for putting Laci on the cover of this book. In all probability, Amber Frey had no say whatsoever in the book's cover design. That is entirely up to the publishing house, and only the most powerful authors get any say in jacket design. So everyone who is upset about the cover should write to the publisher, Regan Books, and express their dissatisfaction.If you must read this book, check it out of the library, go to a bookstore, pick out one of those big comfy chairs they have and read it, or wait a few months and pluck it out of a remainder bin.But truthfully, there are much better ways to spend your free time."

__label__1,"Hollywood FORMULA getting worn down: The SCRIPT Is Not Enough! Every Bond movie must have a casino -- so right in the middle of the plot (bing!) it cuts right to James Bond being in a casino for no reason at all. It adds nothing to the movie, but he has to make an appearance there. And a hot new car, outfitted with all the gadgets (we're supposed to say ooooh, aaaaaah, niiiice car!) and they destroy it within five minutes of him driving it, before you get a chance to see what it can really do. Nothing new or exciting, just the same old formula randomly patched together. Come off it, let's get something new into the formula, instead of desperately rehashing the best two-minute snippets of every Bond movie that's come before, and hoping it all adds up to a watchable movie! It left me feeling like a cow pushed through the Hollywood stockades. This is the end of this review, so now is the time you are supposed to laugh and smile, and go away feeling good.

__label__1,"HUGE price, NEGATIVE results: I have tried several probiotics available on the market and was having good results with Renew Life's Ultimate Flora, but someone suggested to me that this Healthy Trinity was the absolute best, so I forked over $100+ for the 90 caps and I'm very sorry I did. Just one dose gave me gas and sickening stomach pains and discomfort for 2 days straight. I did not take it for a couple days after that, then tried it once again and had the same negative results. Now, I just know someone is going to leave a comment attempting to explain to me that this is a ""detox"" effect and I will tell you this: that is absolute bull! A probiotic either helps your overall digestion or it does not, period. And this one, for me at least, absolutely does NOT. So, if you are looking for an alternative to this, I can only suggest Ultimate Flora...it's the best I've tried and it actually works. I'm glad I kept my receipt because this overpriced garbage is getting itself returned asap."

__label__1,"Much Too Slow!!: I completely agree w/ the other one-star reviews. The book started out much too slowly -- who cares about Lena's clothes, memories, and so on? Let's get to the story.

Finished the thing in about 2 hours that way.Won't read the rest of her stuff."
__label__1,"Past its Prime...: At the time Bill Mathis was writing his ""handbooks"", the internet wasn't immediately available to everyone, nor were forums really existing.. so information exchange like this is quite a goldmine.. anyhow, the suspension to be built from this book is easily attainable already prefabbed by MANY companies nowadays And isn't really necessary to fabricate anymore.. He recommends using a lot of factory parts as well that are no longer necessary to use due to other innovations via the aftermarket. As far as the theory and engineering behind the parts built and learning from that, Bill himself has came onto widely used mustang forums and made remarks that the publishers, more concerned with shelf appearance .. highly edited the handbooks and therefore significant information is INFACT MISSING.. In the end, if the book were still 12-15.00 I think it'd be worth having for flipping through.. other than that, you should be doing some serious research here online.."

__label__2,"Tasty Organics!: It's very good. The noodles alone put all other soup noodles to shame. They're fresh, firm, and just the right size. The broth is darker and richer than other canned chicken noodle soups I've tried. It's also seasoned well with lots of chicken and veggies. Nice to have organic products that taste good!"
__label__1,"Not so good. Just a sad attempt at a thriller.: I was let down. The characters were not that hot, and the story was cleche. Sorry, just my opinion."
__label__2,May never see the reader again.: I bought this for my 15 year old son. He spends loads of time reading and using the information. He says it is a very useful book.
__label__2,"I'll never feel the same about the Jersey Shore!: Brrr! Of the many, many fascinating things I learned from this marvelous book, the one that will stick with me as I stick my toes into the Atlantic this summer is the part about helicopter pilots regularly spotting sharks ... BETWEEN the shore and the bathers! Wonderfully written and researched, with great attention paid to the characters, even the shark! I can't say enough good things about this book."
__label__2,"One of my favorite books: The first thing you are likely to wonder is why used copies of this book often go for [fifty dollars] or more in online auctions. Here's why. Once having read it, you'd really truly miss the ability to share it with disbelieving friends. I admit, I am biased, since I happen to have the same type of vehicle/kitchen used in the writing and testing of these recipes. If you own a different type of vehicle, your mileage may vary. Sorry, couldn't resist. It's hilarious reading even if you don't have the guts to try it yourself. The somewhat prosiac nature of the recipes, as derided by one reviewer, actually serves to heighten the surrealism. If you're attracted to the title, the book won't disappoint."
__label__2,"Magnificent!: I loved this book! Ever since I was two, I've loved unicorns and this is my favorite unicorn book. I can't believe these beautiful pictures. On the very last page of the book, there are even tips on finding a unicorn. (what not to bring, what to bring, what the unicorn might do if you actually see one, ect.)"
__label__2,"A WINNER: WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IN THE 60'S I WAS 11 YEARS OL AND I THOUGHT IT EWAS GREAT THEN A ND STILL FEEL THE SAME WAY NOW. ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN. THE SONGS ARE CATCHY, WITTY AND FINELY EXECUTED. LOVED IT THEN AND LOVE IT NOW."
__label__2,"This album is SO GOOD!: I keep listening to this album over and over. I'm a true country music fan, and I'm impressed with Nesmith's commitment to a traditional sound. I'm also impressed with his songwriting and singing abilities. If you thought Michael Nesmith was just the goofy-hat-wearing guy from the Monkees, think again: this is a really talented guy! I would highly recommend this album."
__label__1,"fluffy: This is kind of okay, but a little fluffy for my tastes. It's sort of a Martha Stewart meets Charmed. If you are looking for a ""how-to"", this one is kind of like an appetizer before your steak and potato."
__label__2,New Game Old Movie: From Russia with love has good graphics and has an alright camra. The reason why I gave it a 4 out of 5 is becuase kids arent going to like the gagedts in the game are hte cars. Speak of which driving the cars were pretty bad no matter how hard you push the button down the other cars all was cacth up to you pluse the car drives realy slow. So if you like old James Bond Movies then play this game but if not then play 007 Everthing or Nothing.
__label__2,"Informative and Realistic !: This is not a book that was written for those expecting spooky pulp horror stories. This is not a book about Voodoo. This intelligently written non-fiction describes a fascinating religion and the people that practice it. The insight into the daily life of an initiate is impressive. The descriptions of the Gods and Goddess, Their offerings and worship is clearly and beautifully written. The book is very informative and I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in Santeria."
__label__2,"Enbiggen your brane!: I got this toy for Christmas, and after making fun of it ""oh, it looks simple enough, should we even play with it"", the fun began. As the other reviews have mentioned, it is difficult to turn the pieces, only if you don't have them lined up exactly, which is mildly annoying the first couple times. After that, it's cake. What isn't cake is solving the puzzle! It's been 6 months, and passed from everyone from Grandparents to nieces, and still no completion. As far as durability, this thing has been thrown in frustration several times by myself and I'm sure more by others, and is still in perfect condition... it actually is easier to move the pieces now, go figure.All in all I would say this is the best toy in the world. But oh, so maddening."

__label__1,"Expected Better: I was so excited to purchase the video monitor! Although I was a little disappointed with the quality of the performance. There was an extremely large amount of intereance and my daughers room was only about 100 feet away. For $200 I had higher expectations. I just returned this item and have purchaed the Mobicam 2.4gh Handheld, which has more features, voice activated video (which I thought was a huge plus), longer range, you can add 3 additional cameras. I found it at Target for $159. Great Buy! Don't waste your time with this one learn from my mistake and by the Mobicam."
__label__2,"A quickie look at Brit Slang: This is more of a pamplet, so at the price, it is a little shy of fulfilling its aim. It gives you some of the more common slang. Good for writers looking to sprinkle in a few colourful touches or as it is says, for readers of Brit mysteries.However, it is thin so I would recommend a few others in the same price range that delivers more.Good, but not enough."
__label__1,"Does not grind espresso: Bought at a non-ecom store - to go with my espresso machine. At the finest setting the water flows through the portafilter with no backpressure. Will not grind espresso for your Gaggia machine. Also know that this will not make Turkish coffe, Brian Jones, etc.Does OK with french press grind. I'm sure it probably does adequate drip, too, although I do not make drip. I'd suggest, though, that the only improvement over a blade grinder is ease.I'll be donating this to Goodwill - at least someone will not have to pay $50 for it and I'll get my money's worth in tax deductions."
__label__1,"Indeed, too large for most applications: Just as the other reviewers have already noted, it's unfortunate that Lenmar thought it to be a good idea to make these adapters as large as they did. They may well be within spec, as another reviewer pointed out, but they are larger than a regular C-cell battery. I bought the set at a local store for a Mint beacon, and I have to push them in with some force, and can only remove the shell using a pair of pliers. Not clear why the engineers didn't make the shell just a little bit smaller ..."
__label__1,"Dissapointing: The book has a very clever idea, but that is the end of it's value to me. The characters are flat and boring and the text is lacking in subtlty. The author burdens us with self-rightous lectures making us feel like naughty eight year olds"
__label__2,"I can still quote this book years later: This is such a memorable book I can still quote it years after reading it. For example, a cop puts someone in a holding cell. He comes back later and can tell instantly if the person is guilty or not. How does he know? Read the book! Or how does a cop look at the home of an 80-year-old man and know he's a child molester? Then there's the story of the mobster who actually says, ""It's so hard to find good help."" One cop tells what child molesters say when they're captured, how they sickly view the relationship with the child. There's the capture of a child molester after a kid describes lots of yellow doors and seeing a plane through the ceiling -- this book just captures the attention with lots of quick, compelling stories. Very well done, worth reading!"
__label__2,"Interesting: The story starts off about the Indians, then goes into the part about the town, then goes on to the story. The lead up is good. Hard to believe this could happen to such wonderful men and women. sad story"
__label__2,"I love it cute and compact: I just got this camera today from walgreens, after changing the frequency to 60HZ instead of 50HZ all my photo's come in clear and unblurry. It comes aready at 50HZ so if your having problems with it beeping and flashing and the picture still not right that is it. It is slow to relize your pushing buttons but it does respond. In the container I got the cord(usb), bag, batteries, and carry string. I love it."

__label__1,"Could never get this to work: I couldn't get the camera to work on the first one, which I sent back for a replacement. The camera didn't work on the second one either. Save your time and money. I'm see looking for a wireless system that works."
__label__1,"Gets Increasingly Ridiculous: THE GREEN MILE (1999) * * 1/2 This movie has the best money can buy: great character actors in most roles, wonderful sets, excellent photography, and is never boring despite it's 3 hour length. That said, it's a shame that in its third hour the movie just keeps getting increasingly ridiculous to the point that I really can't recommend it. Oscar nomination for best picture was a joke, as was the one Michael Clark Duncan as the giant, childlike black death row inmate. Hisperformance consists of contorting his face into a grimace and letting his eyes well up with tears."
__label__1,"Dollar Store Stuff: Each and every track here has been release and re-released a hundred times. All of these songs are dated and up to 55 years old (J Cash-I Walk The Line-1956). The artwork is absolute minimal with zero artists, chart or song information.The sound is fine and the selections are indeed classic but this same selection with the same songs has been offered many, many times before.Save your money.."
__label__1,"End of a beautiful friendship: This book is similar to the first fifteen minutes of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" in which all of Indy's quirks are explained down to the scar on his chin. Only in this case, it's not funny, or even fun. Walsh gets the characters' flaws correct, but completely misses their strengths -- especially Renault and Victor Laszlo, who seem to be completely different people here. He also removes the nobility from both Rick and Ilsa, making their sacrifices vain in both senses of the word."
__label__2,"BEAUTIFUL: Excellent film!I really enjoyed the characterizations of the people and felt that she really caught the essense of Marilyn-the sadness, the sensuality and the innocence as well."
__label__1,"Do NOT WASTE your time: This has got to be Jack Nicholson's worst movie ever. The story is unbelievably boring, depressing and lifeless. Other than the movie ""She's So Lovely"" this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I only watched it through to the end because I kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't!The best scene in the movie involves Kathy Bates naked in a hot tub. That says it all.Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE!"
__label__2,"A film well done: Hats off to Hollywood for not only bringing Zorro back to the screen, but for doing so with quality actors, and great production. Anthony Hopkins, the best there is. Antonio Banderas, at last a latin leading man worth watching. Talented, charming, a do it all actor from comedy to serious drama, action adventure, you name it. 2 hrs 20 minutes, really? So enjoyable I never noticed. Time flies when you're having fun. Everyone needs to see this one."
__label__2,"Not bad, not great - Adequate: It works, that's the best part. But be careful when ordering - this unit does _not_ have a removable water tank. You need to use the valve at the rear. And don't tip it after it's been running or you might find water has leaked out. FYI, this model does _not_ heat. I don't know if the description has been changed, but that was not clear to me when I ordered. That's not a minus, just pointing it out. If you need heating, get the EH model.That aside, the unit cools well and it is what it is ( a big portable unit). The remote works well (although, hilariously, it opens the tray on our dvd player too) and it was packed well."
__label__1,"Out of place: Finch, Alkaline Trio, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Midtown, The Used. What are good punk bands like these doing with Blink and NFG? Well, I think blink was trying to put together real punk bands to make fans of punk become more turned on to radio-friendly pop packaged as punk thereby giving them a couple million bucks to go buy Hurleys clothing for their MCA loving poser selves. Besides, it's not one Alk3's shining stars on here, Midtown could do better, same for The Used. Finch is about the only band that shows what they've got on here. This album annoys me and so does Atticus trying to make people think that punk rock is a trendy style. Go take the 5 bucks you were going to spend on this and go get ""All Hallows Eve"" EP by AFI. I swear it's about 50 times better than this (stuff). In closing, I would recomend this album to a teeny-bopper rather than a fan of actual punk fan. later."
__label__2,A must have book on Freshwater Fish Keeping: This book is packed with hundreds of great tips for keeping your fresh water fish happy. It gets you started on the right foot. Getting your equipment and picking out the right fish for you is a snap. The book explains in detail which kind of aquarium to get... how much gravel and even which pump is better then those high priced ones. Great for the beginner like me. This book is my first pick for anyone needing to know alot about fish and caring for them
__label__1,"Children, can you spell boring? I knew you could.: Hmmm...Let's see. This book is called Building A Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair. Hmmm...Strange, then that the book should be 90% full of little tidbits, nuggets, and musings on Fitzgerald's life. Not only is there little new or real information about Sarah McLachlan, there's nearly nothing about Lilith Fair (only Fitzgerald's opinion about Lilith Fair).Not one word in the title is represented in the book. No one but Fitzgerald is building any mysteries (about an alleged stalker), and it's definitely not a story about Sarah McLachlan or Lilith Fair.Let's hope that someone else can come out with a book that has actual information in it, and a little less vain rambling."

My issues were chronically arriving late. One arrived nearly a month after the rest of California had that issue, and I was told over the phone that the newsstand issue ships faster and since I was a subscriber that it was normal for the issues to arrive so late! I realize the subscription is cheap, but they get your data and info and do sell it to others and I have gotten crap offers in the mail as a result of this magazine subscription, but they cannot and will not deliver the magazine in a timely manner! Whatever you do, do not subscribe! Your issues will never be on time, and the customer service reps do not care!"

__label__2,"Incredible Imagery and Characters: Stephen King has brought the past to life with a book that has both an interesting story line and wonderful characters. Having been born just a little too late to actually experience the sixties, I can now understand a little of what my older brother went through during the Vietnam Era. To say that King is masterful would be a grave understatement. His characters and imagination are second to none."
__label__1,"Doesn't work/not worth the money!: I purchased this as a gift and we were excited to start using it right away, however our potatos were a little old and starting to go soft, but we thought why not. Even with softer potatoes this was horrible to use. Took so much effort to push the potato through and the end was never completely cut.Not being ones to give up we cleaned it up (not easy to do by the way) and put it aside until we had new potatos to see if that made a difference. It did not.Trying to line everything up, pushing, etc was difficult. We then tried the smaller blade for smaller fries thinking perhaps it was the blades, but that was even worse.Just a horrible waste of money, ended up returning it.Would not recommend."
__label__2,"Great CD!: Very good CD, it makes me think about everything and its good when your working or when your sleeping. It have one or two ""bad"" songs but the rest are top quality. ""My Weekness"" always makes me think and put me in good mud. And if you enjoy the essays of Moby, then you'll love it! I advice you to buy it..."
__label__1,Don't waste your money!!!: Not worth the money!!!! Piece of junk! It is not kick activated as stated in the advertisements. I actually called the company and am receiving a credit because I had thrown out the packaging.
__label__2,Great A/C: This is a great little a/c unit. Cools down my 11x12 room quickly. Quiet unit. Convenient remote control is a bonus.
__label__2,"Dated but still relevant: Buzzwords like ""eProcess"" have long since gone away, but this book is still relevant if you can find it tucked away in a library. It contains material definitely worth considering in a Web 2.0 era, such as:- Why does Process matter?- How do you manage relationships in an electronic word?- How do you embed business rules in software?- How do you manage an eCommerce business?Drop the buzzwords and this is still important today."
__label__1,"you would have to be retarded to enjoy this movie: Even if you are one of the dorks who play this video game, surely you couldn't find this movie entertaining. It is a plot-less heap of wasted film. The violence wasn't even intertaining. Twenty-something brats on an island who magically and instinctively learn how to fire automatic weapons at zombies no less. I was hoping I would aspirate my drink so I wouldn't have to continue watching it. Luckily I was in my own home so the cursing at the screen didn't offend anyone, including my wife who was cursing at it with me. Simply pathetic."

__label__1,"Tastes fine but stay close to a bathroom: I've purchased and tried a lot of protein powders over the years. This past year, I've been trying to educate myself more on the ingredients and purchasing only those protein powders/shakes that are closer to being ""all-natural"". I thought the Jay Robb product was a winner. I purchased the vanilla whey protein, mixed it with skim milk and a scoop of peanut butter. It tasted fine but man it was death to my stomach. I thought perhaps it was something else that I ate and stuck with it for the next few days varying my diet but to no avail, the bathroom issues kept reoccurring. So I stopped the protein powdeer and went to the Jay Robb protein bars and same result. When I stopped eating all of Jay Robb's products, bathroom issues cleared up. Coincidence??? I was also a bit disappointed when I opened the container and only half of it was filled with powder. Not cool."
__label__1,Awful: There isn't much to like about these sheets. They wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired - hanging threads are all over the place. I would not recommend these sheets at all.
__label__2,"Can't beat it for the money: I've been drolling over a LeCrueset for ages, but never could rally the money for the expense. Too many priorities, but when Mario's Dutch oven came out I was drawn to the color. Now, the color isn't everything, and usely I don't like to purchase products put out by celeberity chefs, but I read a few reviews online and my fav. magazine did an article on it. The reviews were positve, but of course didn't compare to LeCrueset. I decided to buy it a few days later, and I haven't been sorry. For one, I finally have a Dutch Oven, and second it cooks perfectly. The only complaint I have is the lid isn't as snug as I would like, and I knew this might be a problem going into the purchase since the magazine article tagged it as its down fall. Cooked a brilliant Shepard's Pie."
__label__2,"Mega Album about Musical and Metal: If you like Heavy Metal and the Musicals of Webber or Steinman (or together) have to buy it. This is musican live of Meat Loaf on 2 CDs. The three new songs are fantastics. Andrew Lloyd Webber is the best composer of now. It is 5 stars CD, but I'm missing ""For Crying Out Loud"". I have got a message to Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman: you could make more songs together with symphonic orchestras and then you will be the best band of rock and opera.

__label__1,"Great TV, miserable DVD: This is great when used for TV, but the DVD player is pathetic. I constantly have to deal with image scrambling and voice/picture off-sync. I also have the problem of vibrating tray - which is enough to drive anyone nuts! DVD mode loses your place if you accidently switch to TV mode, which happens more than you might think . Having to open the remote to start a movie pretty lame, there should be a more accessible 'enter' button. Warrantee is lousy. Would love to return due to manuf. defects, but cannot! Very dissappointed."
__label__2,"Easy to assemble: The hammock seems to be durable and is very lightweight. It took me under a minute to assemble it. However, it only is guaranteed to hold up to 150 lbs. Also, the ropes that are included are relatively short, limiting the distance between which the hammock can be set up. However, it does pack up very well and seems to be great for camping."
__label__1,"ALL THIS AND WORLD WAR II: I'm gonna wash this film right out of my mind. It is long and it is dull. Deadly so. There is a scene in the beginning that introduces the character of Bloody Mary that defies all logic of reshooting. Mitzi Gaynor in the lead is a pixie in search of a Gidget movie although her sexy ""Wonderful Guy"" bit on the beach is one of the film's few redeeming moments. But it just never clicks, like a tired wave lapping against a shore, it goes on and on. When it ended, I felt like I passed an endurance test."

__label__2,"Authority: I believe that the author's purpose in the ""The Lord of the Flies"" was to show that without laws, there would be chaos in the world. To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority. The literary element that Golding handled the best was symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos. This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful. The only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand. If I had written the book. I wouldn't have used such large discriptive words But "" The Lord of the Flies"" was a good book and I would recommend it to my friends or anyone looking for a good book to read."

A key to the slant of this book is in the title itself, ""Spectral Evidence,"" which is suggestive of ""no evidence."" What, then, could account for the estrangement of Holly, her sister and mother, from Gary Ramona?"
__label__1,"Great movie on a horrible disc: If you're interested in this excellent movie, buy a different version...this one was so poorly done, so over-compressed, that characters' heads jumped around by several pixels while standing still, and faces were occasionally obscured by football-sized ""artifacts"" -- junk on the screen that should not have been there. Yuck! We'll be upgrading to one of the multi-disc versions and hoping that the compression was better done there."

__label__1,"worst toy over: what a waste of money and a monumental effort to ""make"" kisses. 8 minutes to heat up, 4 minutes to melt chocolate, squirt into the mold and then 15 minutes in the fridge to harden. All for the max the mold can hold at a time, FOUR kisses. Not too hard to set up but the cleaning is such a pain. Can't wait til my kid turns her back so I can trash it."

__label__1,"hate filled polemic: Pipes' utter and complete disprespect of the russian people in general and communists in particular oozes out of every paragraph of this book. According to him, nothing, absolutely nothing good ever came out of the soviet union. Every action taken by the communist party was a complete failure. Communism turned the entire russian people into alcoholic slackers incapable of accomplishing anything. I can see exactly where President Reagan got his russophobia from. Don't waste your time with this book. To quote the Sting song, ""...the russians love their children, too."" But you wouldn't know it from this book."
__label__2,"Finally some practical ideas: I'm so glad to have found this book! Most of the others I have read talk about ADD and how it affects your life in general, rather than giving very specific suggestions of how to cope with it. This book is full of things you can do in the real world to cope with ADD. I highly recommend it."
__label__1,"Did not enjoy Persuasion on first read but may re-read: I studied this book in a first year Romantic & Victorian course which I did not enjoy. I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it. I studied an 18th Century Fiction course and enjoyed Mansfield Park and other very interesting novels. I did enjoy this course.I'm returning to Austen because I recently purchased Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, and I feel it would be a crime not to read the original first.If I enjoy Pride and Prejudice I might just return to reading Persuasion again, just to see if I find it a much better read."

Then, I put the file on my handheld and I read it whenever and wherever I want.

__label__2,"Great Collection of Karen Kingsbury Stories: A Kingsbury Collection: Where Yesterday Lives, When Joy Came to Stay, and On Every Side by Karen Kingsbury is 3 Novels in one. I haven't read a lot by Karen Kingsbury but the books I have read do NOT disappoint. Her stories are beautifully written and truly honor God and His love for us. In each of these books show personal struggles of the characters and how God worked in their lives to help overcome these struggles. I found myself taken in from the start of each story and had a hard time putting them down. Each of these stories addresses problems that men and women face on a regular basis: struggles with their belief in God, struggles within marriage, depression, the feeling that life is falling apart. Each story touches on different aspects of life.I highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys Christian Fiction and enjoy Karen Kingsbury's books. You will not be disappointed. I look forward to reading more by Karen Kingsbury."

__label__2,"Revisiting a Dance Hit from the 1990s: Campy dance act Army of Lovers won't ring any bells to mainstream listeners, but they did have an infectious club single in 1992 called ""Crucified."" Silly if not borderline blasphemous, ""Crucified"" is a definite guilty pleasure of a song that was well embraced by clubheads back in the day. Imagine Andrew Lloyd Weber set to a drum machine, and you may get the general idea. On this single, we get a variety of mixes; the best of these is the DNA remix, which gives the original version a welcome disco thrust. Add Army of Lovers to Technotronic, Robin S and Right Said Fred to the list of guilty pleasure dance acts of the 1990s."
__label__2,"MOOing for Newbies: This is a great book for MOO newbies. It walks you through the basics of MOOing step by step. It teaches the reader how to interact and build in MOO across many MOO platforms (EnCore, LambdaCore, etc.) It is a great text for new MOO teachers and students alike."
__label__2,"New Found Glory = N.F.G. = Now Forever Great!!!: New Found Glory although still not quite widely known is still in my oipinion the greatest band ever. That may seem like I'm going too far, but that is my honest opinion. And much like every other album they released this one too is awesome! Just sample any one of their songs and chances are if you like that one then you'll like them all. NFG is the only band I've loved every song of because I am so particular and I hope that you'll love them too! Enjoy!"

__label__2,"an astounding vision: This is an incredibly conceived animation. I'm intirgued by how it has been dubbed into english, there are lots of blank spaces in the dialogue and stillness in the image that I'm guessing might come from a more involved Japanese original. The effect is that sometimes the pace looses dynamism, All in all though its an astounding vision and what really mkes it is the depth of the surround sound track, alongside some really great drawing of course."
__label__1,"because they wouldn't allow me to select zero stars: I just finished reading The Catcher In The Rye, and I'm very confused. Maybe I took this book too literally, maybe the entire book is symbolic of something other than a kid wondering the streets of NY for a few days. My wife kept asking me how the book was, and I kept telling her that it's boring but something exciting is bound to happen soon. I mean this book is supposed to be great right? Well, nothing ever really happened. This book is very short, but it seems to take forever to read. Perhaps, after years of reading Stephen King books, I've come to expect too much."

With everything in the toy room that needs batteries, it's nice to have a system specifically for the Leapster, as the battery life is drained quickly.

It's compact, hikes are easy to sort out by distance or time, directions and descriptions are perfect for first-timers. It's best to go easy when arriving at altitude or hiking with very young or older guests. This is a great resource to have on hand."
__label__2,"A great tool for learning: This book is great if you want to learn the words to some really beautiful songs or learn to play them on piano. I bought it to learn the words to the Italian and Spanish songs. It's very useful in that way. You can read along and listen and learn how to pronounce the words and after a few listens you'll be singing along with Josh. His self titled cd is a must have. His voice is heavenly and he is not an opera singer, he's a classically trained vocalist that could sing anything he wants."

This mix is great because it truly highlights all the different musical elements he's capable of. CD 2 is a sample of what you would hear from midnight to about 8am, and CD 1 is what you would hear from 8am-2pm; then he might even keep playing if club management gives the ""OK!"" :::thumbs up::: :)I still prefer his LONDON mix, but this one is a great taster and example of what you might hear at his shows.Mad love."
__label__2,"Good headphones but there are better options: I wanted an inexpensive pair of full sized headphones and ended up purchasing the Sony MDR-XD200 and the Koss UR-20. They are both nice and sound great but I do like the Koss headphones better. The Koss headphones come with a better warranty and seem to have a higher quality build (thicker, more rugged cable and generally feel more solid.) I also find the Koss headphones to be more comfortable. I wear glasses and have a pretty narrow head. The Koss headphones hold on much better and are softer, wider and more flexible over head. The Koss headphones are also a bit less expensive. I do like the Sony headphones but think that at this price point the Koss UR-20 is a better option. Hope that helps.Koss UR-20 Home HeadphonesSony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones"
__label__2,"An Amazing Literary Success: As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I am still amazed by the success of Richard Bach's JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL. In an era when books are growing increasingly complex and complicated, Bach's book continues to stand out because of its simplicity. Bach spins a tale about a ordinary seagull who finds himself on an extraordinary spiritual journey. This book is a fascinating read, and Russell Munson's photography provides the perfect illustrations for the story. JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL remains one of my all-time favorite books."
__label__1,"Good Idea, bad follow-through: K.W. Jeters did have a good idea when he thought of making a story in which Boba Fett was the main character. That being said, may I say that that was all that was good about it. First of all, it is inconsistant with the Star Wars Universe, most prominently Tales of the Bounty Hunters and Tales of Jabba's Palace. Zuckuss is not a sniveling wimp, but a cool and composed bounty hunter, and NOT a member of the guild. His partner, 4-LOM, is nowhere to be found either. Bossk, also is NOT a member of the guild, mush less the son of its leader. He is not a spoiled brat, but also a cool, composed bounty hunter with all the moves. IG-88 did not even exist during that period, so I won't go there. The Dengar plot had no point that I could determine, and was not a large part of the book. Lastly, this was a pointless book with a few badly-executed ideas."
__label__1,"Stay away from this workout: Got this from the library to decide if I wanted to buy it. I'm very glad I didn't buy it. Austin gives no instruction on how to do any of these moves. From the limited exposure I've had to both Pilates and yoga, how you do them is the most important part of the exercise. Her instruction alternates between ""Beautiful!"" and ""This is so good for you"".I'm not a fan of hers from the dumbed-down workout programs she has been doing for years. Since she oversimplifies a regular workout, I was hoping I could get great instruction in these 2 disciplines. Boy, was I wrong! It seems like she thought everyone else is doing a yoga/Pilates tape so she should, too. Kathy Smith New Yoga is much better."
__label__2,"The Tiny Snowflake: I like this doll because of the sparkle you see on the snow when sunlight or moonlight shines down on it. This one has that same likeness. The pearl-es-cent luster of the gown of jewels and sequins,the marabou feathers on the hat and sleeves all contribute to that moment. What seams to be represented as cold is warmed by that happy little Barbie face. That to little girls is it saying: ""Come , I have secrets of winter to show you"". Dana R."
__label__2,"Everyone Can Gain From This Book!: I bought this book after seeing a review. I thought it would have great humor in every page. I did find it entertaining; however, it was drier than I had anticipated it to be. Having taught in a writing lab, I realize the importance of grammar. For there are many people that do not understand the rules of grammar. Many are too embarrassed to seek help. Therefore, this book will serve as a tool for them to grow. For they can study it in the privacy of their own homes."

It was often difficult to calculate when my evening mealtime would be, so sometimes I took it with dinner, sometimes a half hour after dinner.I lost nothing on it. The label says green coffee extract only, and I didn't consider looking up the website when I got home with my purchase. I've not seen any other brand available in stores. Spent roughly $60 for nothing, at $20/bottle. I exercised, and even began monitoring my calories. Any weight lost, or inches lost, was minor enough to be attributed to the diet, not the pills."

The ""story"" is nonexistant, the acting - if you can call it that - (other than Diaz) is forced and plastic and the action scenes are so over-the-top that you look at them as think - 'Does gravity or the laws of nature exist in their world?' A great example is when one of the Angles jumps off a 3 story building and lands on her feet (high heels no less)- PLEASE...... This is worse than a bad MTV video and more like a kids cartoon (less any plot)."

Only con is when listening it seemed as if the volume was fluxuating from high & low. To be fair I was listening to the cd using a dvd player and it may need to be played in a real stereo system.
__label__1,"Don't believe the hype: I was prepared to love this cd, after reading the glowing reviews. But I don't. The songs just aren't there for me. Nothing here has a hook that grabs me, or an interesting vocal melody or lyric that sticks in my head. I have incredibly diverse taste in music, I can listen to literally almost anything, but this is just plain old over-hyped nonsense. If this is the future of Rock N Roll, God help us all."

The cotton is cheap and nasty feeling. Abrasive like paper towel or something, washing didn't make it any better. I will be tossing it aside for extra. I tried wearing it as an undershirt, by the time the day was over I was itching (literally) to get it off ASAP. For $8 per I feel it should have been a little better quality, I will keep shopping around."

__label__1,Ian Fleming Chick Lit: This may have been Fleming or his publisher's idea to sell more books to a female audience. If you are looking for the real Bond he is not here. This is the most sexually graphic of the Bond novels but from the female point of view. It is claimed that the first romance novel was written in 1972 but The Spy Who Loved Me preceeded it by 10 years. Instead of riding in on a white horse to save the damsel in distress he appears in a T Bird with a flat tire at a cheap motel in upstate NY. Did Fleming really write this?

Though the cost makes one pause before hitting the order button it simply blows you away once you start using it.Those who do ashtanga will enjoy the stability of the mat.It does not bunch up under you :)I have friends who have been using it for years now and swear by it! Yes, it does slip initially but a quick cleaning with mild soap and water took care of it before first using it. It gives you a sense of being firmly grounded, doesn't slip and best of all does not even leave indentations from your toes :))The length is comfortable for taller individuals.It comes with a lifetime warranty as well. I am definitely going to have many more hours of enjoyable practice on this mat.A note of caution, it's much heavier than the previous mats i've used so it would be a lot harder to carry it for several blocks to a class."
__label__2,"The last good movie musical?: Pete's Dragon is a surprise. It is more than just an animated movie about a dragon. It is a true musical in the likes of Mary Poppins and even My Fair Lady. The songs are very memorable and well written (with the exception of Brazzle Dazzle.) The acting is over the top, but it fits very nicely with the theme of the film. The standouts are Red Buttons and Shelly Winters. The DVD transfer is excellent, however the special effects, at times, do look dated. The DVD also has a nice amount of extras. With the exception of Grease, this may be one of the last of the best live action musicals made."
__label__1,"New Book, Old Stereotypes: ""Redneck Nation"" is an attempted satire comprised of over- generalizations and stereotyping. Although originally from the South, the author perpetuates stereotypes that are common among North-Easterners, and the film industry.

In fact, I don't see anything special about it. I love a variety of music, and Ashanti could at least try to come with something different to appeal to fans. I just wanna know for once if she could have an album or song that DOESN'T go: BABY, BABY, BABY, AWW BABY, AWW BABY, OHH BABY, OHH BABY. Ashanti will say baby 80 million times, and write a whole song and chorus about it. I mean really, that's all she says throughout this album, and the other one too. Those seem to be her favorite lyrics, and she's getting paid to sing that, and I could sing that just as good, or probably better. So, it is my opinion that this album really deserves no stars, and I would give it just that if it were possible."

__label__1,"Curriculum and Methodology VERY outdated: I was forced to teach high school Japanese using this textbook for seven years. Both I and my students were unimpressed with the heavy emphasis on its audiolingual methodology. I had to supplement with my own materials for culture and kana/kanji writing. The entire book centers around grammar, not useful Japanese. The current ACTFL proficiency guidelines and National Foreign Language standards now stress task-based curricula used with a more modern teaching methodology that incorporates real-life situations and materials. The book does contain some weird Japanese that is only there to fit the grammar point. The videos are old and the sound quality is bad. If you want good, current Japanese that also includes culture (NONE in the Jorden method!) notes, go with anything put out by the publishers of the Nihongo Journal (ALC Press). No textbook these days is entirely in roomaji either. I gave this book one star for its usefulness as a grammar guide."

__label__2,"Good Southern Fun: This is a good book by a great author. I won't rehash the book blub here but the story line if full of twists so if you are looking for a clean cut black and white romance this isn't it. There is a wide range of characters running through an equally broad spectrum of experiences and emotions. They are witty, they are complex, and they are real."
__label__2,"Laugh out loud funny: Russo departs from his usual style in book and succeeds in writing one of the best comic novels I have ever read. In this book, we are introduced to William Henry Devereaux, Jr., a lecturer at a third rate college in Pennsylvania. Russo manages to make Devereaux a very likable character. While the comic situations are too many to go into, let me say that Russo successfully manages to keep a comic atmosphere without descending into slapstick too often. The characters are all hilarious and that's what makes this book a success."
__label__1,"Average Features: I purchased it to record the old cassettes to CDs, but it did not work. And technical support was not very helpful. Ultimately I had to fall back on Windows Sound recorder, making me wonder why I purchased it.For ripping music from CDs to MP3s, it works just fine, though user interface is complicated unlike other software where you can just copy and paste the files.The retail version is costlier than the one available on MusicMatch site. I paid more for version 6, while version 7 was being sold on the site for less. Also there is no Software Update option available from the menu, though you can go to the site and down load and install new version.My suggestion is - try the free-download version and compare with trial version of other products, before purchasing it. Overall, I will rate it as average performing product with average price. Nothing to rave about!"
__label__2,"Better than expected: I thought this was way better than I expected, after reading some of the reviews.Lots of action and page turning. Tavi and then Isana, win hands down for the book.

""Payback"", ""The Patriot"" and ""The Passion of Christ""(which at least I found to be pretty funny though I don't think it was meant to be) all glorify violence.Catherine McCormack takes off her clothes in this film which is why I give it 1 star and not 0. Unfortunately Sophie Marceau doesn't take off her clothes and even more unfortunate is that Mel does. I found the mooning scene in this movie to be quite childishThis movie is intended for the less intelligent American market rather than for us Scots. All of Mel Gibsons recent films are marketed towards less intelligent people such as George W Bush or the Pope or Mel himself I suppose.Mel Gibson hasn't made a decent film since ""Mad Max 2"" yet he continues to make millions of dollars making these awful films.I guess...YOU CAN TAKE MY TALENT BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE MY MILLIONS!!!!"

__label__1,"Supposedly for computers, NOT: As has been said, this item is a complete piece of junk. The package and labeling advertise it as a plug for use with computers and computer accessories. Except all modern computers are three pronged (ie, they have a ground). This plug does not have a female three prong US. It is thus completely useless, and I am returning both of the ones I purchased."
__label__2,"Wonderfully Different and Imaginative!: ""Helm"" is one of the better stories I have read in a long time. It is well written, the story line is fresh, new and well thought out. The characters, other than the principal two or three are not so exhaustively deep as to boar or to slow down the work. The principals are well developed, certainly well enough for this story. This is a single self-contained story, no series, no trilogy, a great rarity these days and a welcome one I might add.It has everything, a little action, a little romance, a little intrigue. There are parts where martial arts practice are describe in some detail and that can drag just a little, but these parts are fairly short and presented well enough to be interesting to most.I liked this book. I liked it enough to make it part of my permanent collection and that doesn't happen every often anymore. I have found myself rereading it at least half a dozen times.Highly recommended."
__label__1,"Not a comedy, just strange: If you want to watch a depressing movie about a crazy family then this is the movie for you. Yes, anyone who can survive this is truly remarkable but was marketed wrong as a comedy. I found nothing funny about it. The acting was good, but not what I expected."
__label__1,"A movie featuring, but not necessarily about, The Clash.: This movie traces the steps of a ""roadie"", Ray Grange, as he catches on with the Clash during their rise through the English punk-rock ranks in 1977-78 London. The story is neither enlightening nor very entertaining, but for Clash purists, there are a few great moments, such as catching on film Joe Strummer in the sound studio laying down a vocal track, and Strummer sitting down at a piano back-stage before a show and lighting into song. Two stars simply for the 10-15 minutes of live Clash Music on film, which is so hard to find elsewhere. END"
__label__1,"Conservationist? Who? Timothy Treadwell?: I thought I was going to see some really outstanding grizzly filming. This movie should have been labeled ""One man's descent into insanity"". Timothy Treadwell was a self absorbed,selfish, egocentric man and this story is about him and not the bears. Due to his own behavior he became a dish for one of the bears. Too bad he took someone else along with him to his death. A couple of the bears he ""loved"" so much had to be murdered because of his behavior. I would not recommend this movie."

__label__1,"Good subject poorly written: The subject matter is one that should be written about. Gettysburg has a rich and horrible history. Women played a huge role in this battle. But they also did thru out the civil war. I found this story to be confusing. Ms Bell tried to cover to many womens topics for one small book. The book could have been great if she had simplified her story. Did we really have to have, Sybil who seems to switch from a southern Colonels wife to a money grubbing inn keeper while ignoring her wounded husband, who fought for the south but nobody tried to inprison him when the north won the war. There was no consistancy to this book it could have and should have been better."
__label__2,"Great show!!: I hadn't planned on watching this show when it first came on tv. I'd seen the previews for it, but thought, ""Naaah"". My husband had taken a day off and was flipping through channels when he ran up on a Leverage marathon. He watched one and was hooked. Of course, he made me watch one when I got home and I was hooked too!! It's terrific!! The characters are great and the actors are so well-matched and interact so well and their chemistry is great. We hadn't seen the show from the beginning which is why I had to buy the whole first season. This show is like a bag of chips -- you can't watch just one!!!"
__label__2,"Fun series to read: What a fun series! My only issue was that the editing wasn't very good. Words spelled incorrectly, or broken up with spaces, periods, or dashes. Other than that, I was pleased with the ending and how things wrapped up. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough!"

This shows the gritty side of war at the lower tactical level, bringing home timeless lessons on the battlefield. A great addition to any military professional's library!"

__label__1,"Who did the hairstyles for these bad actors?: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen? The actors mostly seem like extras that have had no previous acting experience. The script seems like it was written by a high schooler. The direction is awful too.And.. who is the hairstylist for these actors? Talk about bad hair. The lead character played by Chistopher Lambert looks like Dana Carvey straight out of Wayne's World. Every actor in this movie has a very, very distracting hairstyle. I didn't know they had hair mousse in Julius Caesar's time.It's hard to make it through this movie. It has a made for tv feel throughout and it just one poor attempt at movie making. Do NOT buy this movie before renting it first. You will most likely be very sorry for doing so."
__label__1,"really, really, really, really, really, really, really, BAD!: Sitting through this movie was like torture. I'm not sure what went wrong. They had a good budget, a good premise/idea and great comedic talent and still this movie was like watching grass grow, minus the time-lapse photography. Jokes that just aren't funny unless you're dead drunk and one dumb joke after another, with long pauses of nothing inbetween."

__label__1,"Don't bother unless you like eating pasta particles: I bought this thinking it would be a great alternative to straight corn pasta. As it was cooking I was stirring it and it just started falling apart. By the time I actually got done assembling the meal I was left with a pile of pasta particles. Unfortunately it was also more expensive as well. If you're looking for GF pasta I would recommend Millers Finest. Haven't had this same issue with that brand, it is less expensive and it tastes better."
__label__1,"Someone get Quentin a Dialogue Editor!!: ZZZZZZZZ... Part 1 was good, but someone needs to do an intervention with Quentin. Not every word that he produces on the page is gold. Some of it is out and out awful. Examples: Huge chunks of David Carradine's speeches at the end, and Darryl Hannah's snake/notebook crap. A good editor could have made this movie at least a half hour shorter. Even the most indulgent Italian westerns weren't paced as glacially as this mess.A few good action scenes, but little else to recommend for two and a half hours of your time."
__label__1,"broke easily: we bought this umbrella for my son along with the matching boots. the boots are great, but the umbrella must have been cheaply manufactured as the hinges to keep the umbrella broke very easily."
__label__2,Addicting!!: When I first played this game it was a bit confusing but after a while you start getting hooked onto it. It's pretty long which makes it better. The storyline is that you are partners with Megaman and you can hack into the net and into other kinds of electronics. The WWW is a bad group of people who want to take over the net. You can buy data chips and equip them to Megaman so you can fight those evil viruses on the net and (if you can) stop the WWW. This is a great game with cool graphics.
__label__1,"Ear-bleeding bliss...: Egomania strikes again as this once talented producer is now more like a chihuahua biting at one's ankles in desperate need of attention. Donald needs to hang it up, as he's a mere fraction of his former self, lost on a blind date with Tina that's obviously taken him down the wrong path of his once illustrious career. Every track on here is either his own latest cheese-ball ""house"" remix of various tired artists or they're his bastardized version of otherwise decent tunes (e.g. Dubtribe's ""Equitoreal"" at a speed only a k-hole victim would appreciate, and only a couple minutes of Kult of Krameria's ""Egocentrik"").Pity as I was really hoping this disc would reflect a true live at Twilo feel, or at the very least show some effort and better selection and overall programming on the part of Jr."
__label__1,"Looks nice, sounds terrible: I received this fountain as a gift. Visually, it's actually quite appealing. Unfortunatly, the sound of the pump is impossibly loud. I checked to be sure that the water was at the proper level and the pump itself correctly affixed to the bottom. Regardless, the pleasing trickle of water from the candle spouts was overwhelmed by the churning machine below. Can't recommend it."
__label__2,"The movie that launched a career: This is a 'Saturday Night Live' movie before it became a cliche. Steve Martin was 'born a poor black child', yet becomes a multi-millionaire with an invention that eventually makes people cross-eyed. Throughout the movie he is a bumbling fool and has unforgetable situations and lines. It's bad enough to live in a service station, but when you're excited about being listed (""The new phone books are here! The new phone books are here!), you just have to leave common sense at the door and hang on for a wild ride of silliness."
__label__1,"Boring, monotonous and rushed edition: Not at all impressive, I could not listen and enjoy this recording, as it was done hurriedly and unexpressively. Try Scourby or Waggoner for an interesting, enjoyable edition."

__label__1,1 Star for 1 good song: There was only one good song on this entire CD. I should have bought a single if there was one
__label__2,"Works well, however . . .: The lens hood works well at preventing flares and protecting the lens, but with no instructions, it was a bit tricky learning to mount it on the lens correctly. This is specially true when reversing it for shortage on the lens. While you can leave a UV or other filter in place when using the hood, it drastically reduces its effectiveness. Since the filter is at the end of the lens (not recessed like the front element of the lens) light can still reach it and cause flares. The lens cap can still be used with the hood in place, but it is tedious to remove and replace it unless you have very small fingers. Overall, I like the product; glad I got a geniune Canon lens hood and not a knock-off. The shortcomings are relatively minor and can be worked around."
__label__1,"Does not work for me: I don't know if I just got a lemon or what, but I bought this brand new and have had nothing but issues. If I try to put more than 160 songs on it, it will not turn on (it would just flash iAudio over and over). Since I bought this 2GB purposefully so I could have up to 500 songs, I promptly returned this piece of crap 3 days later. It also froze sometimes when I tried to unhook it from my computer, and I had to take the battery out to make it reboot. This could be an individual unit issue, but I'm not taking any more chances with this brand. Also, they say Mac compatible, but what they really mean is that it won't break if you plug it into your Mac. The software it comes with is definitely not compatible, but you can drag and drop from iTunes. Hope this helps!"

Iwas so upset when Thowra died at the end, I cried my eyes out!I still read it again and again though.It's so descriptive, like all Elyne Mitchell's books, you can see a picture of all the places in your head while you're reading.

__label__1,"Sony Handy-trainwreck: I had the camera for about 2 years before I got the dreaded 'C32 errors' Sometimes the cassette door won't open, sometimes it won't close. If I get it to close, I get the message ""reinsert tape"" message. Googling the error comes up with a couple of fixes 1) slam it down on the table a couple of times (this works for awhile) or 2) send it back to Sony where they will charge you the original purchase price - 9$ to fix it. or 3) There are Youtube videos showing you how to dis-assemble your camera completely to replace the 'mode gear', but thats too close to micro-surgery for me and if thats a Sony part, what's to keep that one from failing as quickly as the original. I have had 'bad luck' with Sony electronics recently; I think I will strike them off my list in the future when looking for electronic gear. Its too bad, because when the camera didn't suck it worked pretty good."

According to Panasonic, there are no parts available, even if I wanted to have it repaired. Sorry Panasonic, you just lost my business."
__label__1,"Disappointed after reading great reviews: This movie got great reviews so I looked forward to watching it. I'm an Aussie living overseas so like to watch as many Aussie movies as I can, and almost always enjoy them. This was the exception. There were just too many parts of the movie where the story line didn't make a lot of sense. Then there was all the 70's ""artsy"" stuff which was a turn off. I will keep it in my collection but probably won't watch it again."
__label__1,"One Star for the Title, Zero for the Movie: I have read the reviews that rave over the comic book or the director. However, if neither of those are household names to you, this is the worst thing you could spend your money on. Unfortunately I was familiar with both, and I make the same statement. A 2nd year film student at UCLA could whip out a better flick than this over a weekend. You might even understand it. Which you will not do with Immortal. The premise was unique, the story line fascinating, but that didn't matter, nothing can save this film, except taking the advice of those who say don't buy it. Don't Buy It."

Tap into your dark side and join the citizens of Rapture, the setting of the game, in an epic adventure that is sure to satisfy the beast in you.

By contrast the original book is readily available second-hand often for a lower price."

A sad and youthful death, yes (why do all the pretty ones have to go first?)----and grieving and loss. But there's little to create an emotional attachment to these characters......even prior to the death.This production is NOT a ""Steam: The Turkish Bath"" in that regard, or even an ""His Secret Life,"" both of which got us more ""involved."" To this viewer, the most interesting point was before film's end, in the denoument between widower, Davide, and a come-to-acceptance and grieving, deceased's father.At film's conclusion, there is a tying-up........a coming to terms.

__label__1,"This book has too many omissions.: A hastily-updated version of an older book originally published in Britain, it lacks guides for dozens of shows such as Beyond Reality, Tales from the Darkside, Goosebumps, Friday the 13th, Probe, Starman, Misfits of Science, etc. Even when shows are covered, they often consist only of a list of episode titles, e.g. Tekwar, Forever Knight, Captain Power, Wild Wild West, VR.5, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Hercules and Xena. Sometimes the listing is woefully incomplete: the book covers only 10 of the 65 episodes of Ray Bradbury Theater and only 13 of the 96 episodes of One Step Beyond. And you can forget it if you're looking for episode info on old shows such as Space Patrol, Rocky Jones Space Ranger, Flash Gordon, World of Giants, Commando Cody, or Way Out. Even some shows currently running on the Sci-Fi Channel, such as Boris Karloff's Thriller, are not covered.

So bad, I couldn't finish it, and I worshipped this guy a little after reading ""The Last Step"" by Ridgeway.

After my subscription has ended I decided not to renew (magazine contents has just really turned for the worse) but these people will keep sending invoices that makes it appear you are ""past due"" on paying the subscription and that you have to pay to be in ""good credit standing"". BEWARE! I have read too in the internet about people getting calls from credit collection agency due to these types of invoices; just google it for more info."
__label__2,"Good Product: Overall a good choice for a water bottle.No leaks. The spout cap (with tether) works pretty well although I question how long before the cap no longer fits tightly.The mfg. says it is dishwasher safe but I have not tried that as I am concerned about the plastic top melting. I hand wash it now.It was rather pricey but at the time our local stores didn't have many choices. Now that spring has arrived the stores have similar types but not brand, for less money."
__label__2,Short & to the point.: Just recieved this. I was able to read it in about an hour. It is a shorter version of other books that have been written about the zero fighter. It goes into the design development testing & combat of the zero. The is a very short list of zero aces short biographies like can be found in books by Hata & Sakaida. At the back is a nice little breakdown of the different versions & fighters developed to replace it. As well as a few army planes. If you have other books about the zero it may be best to save your money. A lot of whats in here is a repeat of those other books.
__label__1,"not a good book for beginner: If you are new to ASP.NET, this is not a good book for you. I don't understand why the author did not have the actual code in the download samples. If he don't want to share his code, why bother to write the book? We the beginners need to have the actual code to play with it, not just reading the examples!!!"
__label__2,It's Worth it: This card is much better than those other bigger less expensive cards. It costs more for a reson. Its higher quility and wont act up in any way. Plus there is no need to install anything just plug it in and poof there you go. You've got everything right there. Also since I'm on the subject go buy Grand Theft Auto III (GTA III) Its the funnest game.
__label__1,"Legend???: This album starts off slow and it's all down hill from there. If you put Peter Green on stage with Kim Simmons (Savoy Brown) or David Gogo, you'd see just what a hack Green really is. Wouldn't waste my time on this disk!"
__label__1,"Got pink handles!: I didn't even open the package. I was so angry to see pink handles for my son. In the product description, pink isn't even mentioned as a possible color you could get. I know that ""colors may vary"", but this was completely inaccurate!"
__label__2,"Outstanding Stuffed Animal: This penguin was given to me by someone and I became somewhat attached to it. My primary/original TY Waddles is a 2006 model with the embroidered eyes (though I also own 3 that are plastic - these are the newer ones). His name is ""Penguinoh"" and he has an active twitter account (@penguinoh), website, facebook account with many photos, and a travel photo blog (with pictures in 25 cities around the world). Yes, I am pretty serious about this thing.These penguins are exceedingly durable; after much wear mine still looks fairly new. They can be washed but I would recommend doing so carefully by hand and not using a washing machine. I can highly recommend this to anyone; it's an absolute steal for price offered on ecom. Note that these are hand made and do differ slightly in appearance from penguin to penguin, which gives each a unique character.NOTE: I am an adult!"
__label__2,Worth the wait: I thought the book was very good. It does get a little boring to me because of so much explicit detail written in on everything. The book is around 750 pages but well worth the read. Can't wait for the final book.
__label__2,"Greatest!: This book is one of the most touching books I ever read. It almost is exactly like my own life! And all the explanation about the life of a girl, puberty and maturity, helps a lot in the modern girl's everyday life. Like all girls, Margaret haves trouble discovering about herself and her body and for support, pray to God to help her. A book wonderfully rich in understanding and the insecurity of puberty and the starting of adulthood,"
__label__2,Quite a good CD: This CD is good but not that great.4 stars is the right rating.I agree with the other reviewers about the lyrics being shadowed by the loud music.They should have made the lyrics a little bit louder.
__label__1,Another music complaint.: I've heard about the music replacement and managed to cancel my preorder before it was shipped.This is absolutely unacceptable.Why do they even bother releasing the set if they mess it up like this?I was so happy when they started releasing the show to DVD - what a shame.
__label__1,"Felt GRIEF after reading this book: I bought this book based on the feedback of others on ecom. I was rather excited to read it once I received the book. Although, this book is written extremely well, I found this book rather uninteresting, slow, and anticlimactic. The author incorporates the letters of Mary Todd Lincoln into the story, which is interesting. To be honest the most interesting character in this book is the dog. This book has a lot of potential. There was just no story-line, no plot. If you want to truly experience a sense of grief, read this book. But I am human and maybe I missed something that others did not."
__label__2,Bridge tablecloth: A group of us is learning how to play bridge and this is a really vaaluable tool - I would recommend it for anyone learning to play.
__label__1,"What a moron!!: Sean Hannity is a delusional, psychopathic right-wing nutjob of the highest proportion. That this man has been given a podium for his sophomoric and anti-intellectual drivel is an insult to the publishing industry. If this is what passes for serious political analysis and discourse in America today we are all in a heap of trouble.Only people with very limited intelligence or a desire to be brainwashed may want to read this book. Others please stay far away!!!"
__label__1,"Cheap camera, cheap pics...: If you're looking for a camera that does the basics and bare minimal - THIS IS IT! It is a 3 in 1 camera that can record video w/o sound, work as webcam, and a digital camera. The pic quality is really poor and often blurry unless taken up close. Indoor pics come out dark, a lot of bright light is needed because the camera has no flash. It has an auto-off feature which helps to preserve battery life. I bought the camera to sell items on ebay and send email pics. That's all that it is great for. If you're looking for a camera for the kids - THIS IS IT. It's compact, lightweight, and sturdy. Just point and click!"
__label__2,"cats meow!!!!!: bought this article last year. Let just say,I pull field arrows out of full size deer target(260 feet per second) with one hand and some good effort. Before I'd sometimes have to pull up deer target and set it on it's side and pull two-handed to get arrows out.This puller will elimanate all(ImeanALL) these promblems.Just be sure to put puller on in a tight fashion(use your head it's easy).I reccomend YOU buy two or more for your hunt buddies,they will surely appreciate it!!!!P.S.don't reccomend useing broad-heads in this type of target,da."
__label__1,Bad product: This product does not work at all. I will never buy it again. I purchased this product because Dr Oz said it would work but I guess he can be wrong to.
__label__2,Excellent read for anyone in law enforcement!: Great book on interviewing. I'll be referring to it for a long time in my line of work!
__label__2,Best Hose Nozzle: This is the best hose nozzle ever -- I bought one then 4 for for other family members. Easy to operate and close to perfect.
__label__2,"A thrilling journey into the heart of fear itself....: This book fully exploits Shirley Jackson's knack for terror. At first I expected to hear about the creepy happenings of an old house, but instead found myself on a roller-coaster ride through madness. A must read for anyone who has any intrest in the occult. This book will destroy all you thought you knew about haunted houses."
__label__2,"The toy looks better than the movie character.: In The Phantom Menace, GraGra was a rubber mask in a sea of CGI. Enshrined in plastic, we see how good the character was supposed to look. Still, it's a figure for the completists or the diorama builders. I doubt there would be any casual shoppers whow see this peg warmer and think to themselves, ""Oh my God! It's GRAGRA!"" It's a sturdy figure with decent accessories. That's about all you can ask from a figure."
__label__1,How dare they: mostly silly shows and plots. time to kill this series. how dare they make a joke out of a very strong Stephen King character. This series drifts so far away from the Johnny Smith depicted by Christopher Walken in the movie.
__label__1,Not the original version of songs!: Be forewarned -- only 3 of the 36 songs in this set are the original versions of the songs.
__label__2,"Impeccable book and service.: This has got to be one of the most pristine copies of a used book I've ever bought on ecom, and the service was quick, courteous, and essentially perfect. What a great vendor!"
__label__1,"Price point way off!: I love the idea. However I think ecom has really missed the price point on this thing. For $400 I would rather buy a iPhone that does way more than a Kindle.The pictures are also ugly, other reviewers have said that it is better in person, but its not like I can go check it out at the store. To me aesthically its UGLY.I am very sad that it is so expensive. I buy ebooks regularly to read on my computer and would love to have a hand held device like this, but it needs alot more features if I am going to pay $400 for it."
__label__2,"Very informative and illustrated well.: A lot of detailed information, including actual photos of surgery techniques. Personal statements from FTM's were very helpful and good reading + information."
__label__1,"Like the Music, Can't Play the CD: Unfortunately, this is not the format in which to buy this great CD. I can't play it in my computer's CD player, because it isn't a DVD player, and I can't use iTunes to copy it into my iPod. Get the regular CD!"
__label__2,"WHY HAVEN""T YOU BOUGHT THIS CD YET???: Hey Aimee Mann's music inspired the story for the movie that was written around a lyric she wrote. Deep music. Didn't win the Oscar it was nominated for but should have. SO WHY HAVEN""T YOU BOUGHT THIS CD YET???"
__label__2,"amazing: this was such a shock... i completely expected a ""one hit wonder"" to come of this with ""last night"", but lo and behold, i LOVE the whole album. can't get enough of it, and can't wait for the next installment!"
__label__2,"Excellent for long term storage: This binder is one of those binder you want to get to store papers for a long time (i.e., tax receipts, bank papers). While I have not had it very long, I can tell it is one that would hold up well to repeated usuage. I used mine to hold bank statements from three separate acccounts (I had to supplu my own dividers) and was able to store two years worth of all three with ample room for growth. The pockets in the front and back are also handy. I use mine to store this month's statements before I reconcile my accounts. I would buy more of these binders."
__label__2,Good product with thin handles: The product is what is says and I have no complaints. The one observation is that with the thin handles it takes a little more effort to maneuver the spoon around the grapefruit wedge.
__label__2,"Indepth review of empathy for all characters: I have been thinking about the characters in this book even days after finishing it.Each major character has a flaw, but the way that Andre Dubus writes about them and the situation of the house, makes you FEEL for every character, regardless of their moral behavior.I was impressed that I could feel for even Kathy Nicolo! I UNDERSTOOD her behavior even though I didn't AGREE with it. The same holds true for Lester and the Colonel. Because the characters were described so fluently, I could be any one of them and feel their rationale for their behavior.Great book! I was sorry for the ending, but again, I could understand each character's behavior, because of Dubus's indepth profile. He pulls you into each character with amazing brilliance!"
__label__2,Gift: Gave this book to my son also - I don't think I read the description well - didn't realize it was poetry but think he will like it anyway
__label__2,"A new favorite book: The first and second books in this series combined are my new favorite novel of all time. This one is different. At first it was a little frustrating that it is so different with its focus on different characters. But this is the one I will re-read over and over. A powerful story, beautifully written."
__label__2,"Best Drama series ever!!!: What more can I say that hasn't already been said? I love to watch this series over and over again, especially with people who have never seen it before! I love watching the expression on their faces as they see this series for the first time!! It is truly a wonderfully entertaining drama series! Being an Italian-American I can relate to most of the family drama and it is very realistic! It is refreshing to see a series portray the Italian-Americans as family oriented people that regard the family as being priority. The writing is beyond genius and the actors bring reality to the characters they portray. If you were to ask me my favorite character, I wouldn't know what to say. I love them all! Especially Tony's dear departed mother, Livia Soprano. I can't wait until season 2 is available on DVD. The magic of DVD makes all the difference!! You are going to looove this series!!! Rush to buy it now!"
__label__1,Soap opera: This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up. I just could not maintain any interest in the continueing lives of Florentyna and Richard.I'm sure they went on to even greater fame and fortune...I just don't care.
__label__2,"Amazing: I recieved this as a christmas gift and instantly fell in love. The turban is weightless, cute, and drys hair fast. The button closure at the back is the best, because now I don't have to worry about having it fall off of my head! Truly brilliant product (no wonder it's always back ordered!)."
__label__2,"Eclectic, tuneful, haunting, evocative, soothing....: I saw Laurie Lewis and Tom Rozum for the first time a few weeks ago -- how have I missed hearing about them all these years? This CD has not left my stereo since I got it...I love the emphasis on nature, solstice, hope, and yes, grace. Thank you, Laurie and Tom, for choosing such an eclectic selection of tunes and delivering them with such heart! My favorite is the haunting, evocative Wintergrace, written by Jean Ritchie. This CD is not a play-it-twice-and-forget-it disc -- it will help you make it through the coldest and darkest of winters. Highly recommended for anyone who loves beautiful harmonies and evocative songs that keep reverberating in your ears, mind, and heart."
__label__1,HALO SUCKS: THE HALO SERIES IS THE MOST OVERRATED GAME FRANCHISE EVER!!!! I HAVE NEVER PLAYED A MORE FRUSTRATING GAME! (EXEPT HALF-LIFE 2) HALO SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1,"xcuse ,e, YIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!: What an incredibly hargy-bargy [...] monstrosity of good taste is this worthless pile of excrement.avoided at all time.people who says it is good are premedicated!"
__label__1,Junk: I needed a numbering machine with the option of zeros appearing or disappearing at will. This machine has the option of depressing the zeros. But once you depress the zeros there's no way to turn them back on. They remain depressed for good. There's also no blank. So I contacted Sparco. My call has not been retuned since three days ago. I suppose they're stuck with those zeros. This a useless piece of equipment heading for the trash bin in no time.
__label__2,It covers a lot of material: This book covers a lot of different aspects of the Illustrator program. The only thing I didn't like about it was the texture of the paper it was printed on.
__label__2,"Love them!: Everything II hoped, I wasn't making headway with traditional fingerpicks, these seem much more natural.Great quality,good packaging and a superior product."
__label__2,"Great price: For the price, it is great. The latch is a little ""iffy"", but it's fine for my uses. Don't think I would trust it with 1200 lbs, though."
__label__1,"Fragile, and not very safe: We bought this for our snorkel trip to the Virgin Islands. It was difficult to pack, because it is supposed to be stored semi-inflated, or at least care has to be taken that it not get creased (we just transported it in the original plastic box, which is rather bulky). But the biggest problem was the inflation valve. It inflates fine, but when it was in use, the top of the valve would wobble slightly causing a slow leak, and after 20 minutes or so, it was completely deflated. One cannot depend on it for protection at all."
__label__2,"Excellent DVD player: I have the older version of the DP300 and it's excellent! From what I've heard, the new version you get today is just as good and has a few advantages over the old one. Both can be made region free (using a secret menu) which is great if you get DVDs from ecom.UK!I've talked friends and family into getting this player and that total now stands at 13 players! All of us love the DP300 and there wasn't a lemon in the bunch.I agree with the positives reported here and don't understand the low ratings. The only real negative is the poor manual but you can search the Internet for a PDF of the Citizen JDVD3830A manual (a Canadian clone of the DP300).Excellent value especially with the [$$$] mail-in rebate!"
__label__2,"Live and swingin': Relatively early Concord release for Bellson, and a swinging affair it is. Hard bop trumpeter Blue Mitchell is particularly fine, as is Pete Christlieb on tenor. Miles Davis's ""Dig"" gets a swinging 9 minute workout. A good album that most people should enjoy."
__label__2,"SORRY I QUIT: Doing this diet last year was a very gratifying experience. I lost weight at a very rapid rate, somewhere between 32-36 lbs. in less than 2 1/2 months. My goal was to loose 100 lbs. I stopped doing the diet because of all the bad hype and decided to join Weight Watchers. As soon as I did that, I noticed my desire for carbs and junk was back in full force.I am now once again on the GREAT DIET and feel my energy level rising again. My daughter-in-law was amazed at how quickly I can walk, now that I am free of all the carbs.Do yourself a favor, try this diet and you will realize the change is truly a blessing.Loretta, if you read this, try it!"
__label__1,Losing you mummy interest: This book has some good stuff in it and was easy to read. I just had trouble trying to follow exercise instructions out of a manual. I wish I would have ordered the video instead.
__label__1,"Insulting, degrading: This book is an insult to Oriental Dance. Mr. Ozdemir reduces the dance to its sexual component. A few quotes from the book: ""Sexuality is overtly offered in Turkish belly dancing and the dancer cannot help being regarded as a sexual object."" ""[Belly dance] costumes have something in common: They tickle men's feelings."" ""This kind of dancing is just a very delicate, feminine and voluptuous call to sexuality.""Although the book contains some interesting historical information, it is overshadowed by the degrading text and trashy photographs."
__label__2,"Classic construction set: My 5 yr old grandson loves to play with Legos when he comes over. I had a hodge-podge of old LEGOs and look-alikes that didn't always work together. This was the foundational set I was looking for. I thought I could keep them at my place since he has plenty of toys at home, but no way was he going for that. This is his go-to entertainment and even though the case makes it highly transportable, it stays home where he can enjoy it every day."
__label__2,"LOVE the movie, it's become a tradition in my house: Is this a grand cinema masterpiece? No. Is it a cheesy, sappy, predictable yet inspiring, happy ending holiday movie? YES!! And that's why this is my go-to movie when I'm staying up late to wrap presents or write Christmas cards."
__label__1,"Product failed after 2 weeks and no support: After only 2 weeks on, the product totally failed, and support is only open from 8-5 mountain time, so if you work, there's no way to get support. We got a form letter by email stating that we could ship the product back at our own cost, at our own risk, to get a replacement. I would definitely not recommend this product."
__label__1,WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?: ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS WAS PURE UNADULTERATED BS. I GUESS I EXPECTED AS MUCH BUT MY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF ME. AFTER ALL DON'T FORGET SHE IS A CHIROQUAKER!
__label__2,"Soulfull and Gorgeous Writing: I don't know where to begin with my praise and appreciation of this book. Right off the bat I loved the atmosphere, the harbor and the lobstering, the lapping sea and creaking boats--and, in the midst of these atmospherics, the lobsterman's inner life.The author's ability to enter the minds and sensibilities of these four people is wonderful. We see how differing perceptions take their toll. I was especially impressed with his ability to fathom and render the many layers of the women. I'm definitely going to check out Mr. Weesner's other works. The writing is at once elegant and unpretentious. The people are likeable and complicated. The story casts a spell. I loved it."

__label__2,Kindgom Hearts Official Strategy Guide: Product was very good and it was in the condition they said it was in.
__label__2,"Wonderful Memoir: Given that I just recently became interested in Lady Thatcher after seeing ""The Iron Lady"", ""Path to Power"" gave me more of an insight to this vital, tough, extraordinary person that became PM. She definitely is an inspiration to all of us who are working our way up. Like Margaret, I was not born into a wealthy family, and was always told ""If you want something badly enough, you will work for it."" Work for it, so I shall and so did Margaret. And like my other role models: Jacqueline Kennedy, and Edward R. Murrow, I applaud Margaret for everything she stands for in history.""I'm in love with Margaret Thatcher!"""
__label__1,"Did not receive the correct product: I cannot actually rate the quality of this product as ecom did not send me the correct one. I ordered the one above, with lavender and chamomile, but received a different one. ecom will not offer a means to exchange this product, only the refund. I should have gone with another seller/company."
__label__2,LOL: Kevin Hart is HILARIOUS- bottom line. I would recommend any of his stand up audio/video. This is one of his older works. He's only getting better with time.
__label__1,"Save yourself the headache: I have owned this print server for about three years now. Each time I change my router I dread having to touch this print server. It is finicky with all the required steps that have been written here before. I work in IT and each time I touch this thing, it's a multiple day adventure and will then just start working one day for no apparent reason - FUN!! When you do get it working, it will just stop working for no reason and require a reset. Do yourself a real favor and just buy a printer with a wireless adapter... or if you really enjoy pain, just hit your head with a hammer - it's cheaper."
__label__1,Great goggle -- bad shipping by ecom: These goggles are EXACTLY what my daughter needs to wear. My only problem with TYR is that ecom was the ONLY place that still had these in stock. My daughter swims competitively and goggles are important.Problem is we are ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY and we live in Europe. The shipping is US -- to an FPO (Fleet post office box) in NY. ecom ships books to FPO's but little else. I had to have these shipped to a friend who had to PAY to ship them to me. I ONLY use ecom when I have NO choice because their shipping policy has gotten very poor for those of us US CITIZENS living in Europe. Enjoy your free market economy at our expense!!

__label__2,"A Few Corrections: The title of this anointed album is ""Just a Closer Walk""; not the song title of ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee"" as ecom has titled it. This album is available brand new from the Kenneth Copeland Ministry website. The lyrics are written within the CD booklet so you can sing along if you wish. ""There is a River"" is my favorite song on this album."
__label__1,"Plainsong: As part of a book club, I read this book. The point of my joining the bookclub was to read books I might normally not have picked up on my own, as I am open to reading about new ideas and subjects everyday. A friend of mine and I both read this book and the next time we met , the looks on our faces said it all. WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD PAPER! I see that the book has now been made into a movie and I told my friend such. All she could say is 'NOOOOO!' My favorite part of the book was 'blah blah blahblahblah, BLAH?' Oh, wait that wasn't part of it but the whole book sure READ like that."
__label__1,average at best: Mobb Deep at one time actually took some risks.but this Album has predictable Production&the Lyrics don't take them anywhere. this album seems run of the mill.I haven';t felt there stuff for quite some time now.I gotta wonder if they still feel it or are just going through the motions.
__label__1,"DO NOT BUY THIS: First of all, I received this DVD player from the seller without a remote control in the box. Second, the DVD player does NOT play all region DVDs. I tried to play a region 4 DVD this morning and it absolutely did not work. I don't know if this is because I don't have the remote control? But either way, I might as well have flushed my money down my toilet. I am so angry about this. Everyone should think before buying this player or from this seller."
__label__1,"Muddled Mathematical Mysticism: Not a book for anyone seriously interested in the intrinsic beauties of math and the natural sciences. Some intriguing factsand suppositions buried amidst Pythagorean mysticism, numerology, and New Wave babble. There are enough factual errors to cast doubts on the whole text (for example, action/reaction is described as one of ""Newton's laws of thermodynamics""). The author writes enthusiastically but has few math credentials and doesn't appear to be an informed amateur either. I expect to see a Website soon pointing out all the errors, but perhaps no one will take it that seriously. I really wanted to like this book, but I recommend trying a book by Martin Gardner or John Allen Paulos or A.K. Dewdney or Douglas Hofstadter instead."
__label__2,It works: Instant code worked immediately. No need to waste time and gas driving to the store to pick up MS points.

__label__2,"This one's a keeper: Saw this on a T.V. informercial. It looked like it would be great to have, especially when my 3 grandchildren come over. You can always tell where my granddaughter sits at the kitchen table, half the food on her plate is on the floor. (She's only 3 years old.) My Electrolux is getting a bit on the heavy side for just a quick pick up besides hauling it out of the closet. I really didn't believe this would live up to the claims made for it, but it does. It's light weight, easy to manuever, and I really like it! I only gave it 4 stars because on the informercial they claim that you can talk on the phone and use it at the same time...yeah sure, in your dreams. The noise is not as loud as a vacuum but you certainly could not use it and talk on the phone or not wake someone should they be sleeping."
__label__1,"A waste of money: I didn't care for any of the pieces in this book. They are repetitious and not very melodic, in my opinion. Just not my cup of tea."
__label__2,"The best bedtime toy: We first learned about this toy when our baby was in the hospital. We attached it to his crib and he loved it. He loved it so much that we went and got one for him. Whenever he is upset we just have to turn it on and he calms right down. It has different settings so they either have something to see, listen to or both. It is really great for a young baby.I do not think that any nursery should be without this toy."
__label__1,"Simplified Aircraft Design dor Homebuilders: Everything that I read about this book said that it was wasy to understand. There was very few things simple about the book. It didn't break down the deatail of the building process. For example, Building the wings, the fusealge, the canopy, landing gear and so many oher things. I am very disappointed regarding the entire book. I was going to send the book back but, I would not get back the total amount back. I still have the book and I'm going to send a message to the author of the book. Please, put my review out there."
__label__2,"Good In Parts: I have gradually been won round by this CD. Japan's Queen of Melancholy is back to her best on Yori Sou Kaze, Kawa Kaze, and Getsu Ya Dou Shuu. Some of the other tracks, such as the title track Koibumi, are too 'late night bar' music for my personal taste. On the whole, however, the CD is worth it for the three or four outstanding tracks.Two minor criticisms: First, the CD includeds an insert of English translations which, though accurate, are boringly pedestrian and do no justice to the songs. Second, the cover picture is unflatttering, particularly if compared with that on Ima No Kimochi"
__label__2,"The Green mile: So far I'm about 2/3 of the book and I'm loving every single moment of it. How Stephen King grabs your attention. It about an African-American convicted of rape and murder of two young girls. People are convicnce that he murdered them looking by the size of him. He big as a giant and has the mind of a child. He is sent to a Penitentiary where he about to be executed when a prison guard believe he is an innocent man. He believe the convicted man is innocent, so he investigate his files and starting questioning people about the murder. And the only way he could be free is by the prison Guards. I would recommend this book because talk about the struggle between life or death and how mysteries get involves trying to solve the case."
__label__2,"real cranberries: I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound, elegance, quality, essence, delicate sadness and youth. It is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post XX century pop music.I do recomended.(...)"
__label__2,great read: Great read...I think a must read. I bought these books as spare copies as I am always recommending it to friends and colleagues. Was delivered quickly and as promised.
__label__1,"Does not perform as stated: I bought this product based upon the reviews on this site. I can tell you, after having purchased it and followed the instructions regarding dosage, aeration, filtration, and cleaning that to date, the product does not work at all. My pond is still green as can be. This product appears to be nothing more than water with blue food coloring in it. Prior reviews must have been written by company spokespeople, because this product does not work as stated. I cannot tell any difference at all in the water purity. Please don't waste your money like I did."
__label__2,my opinion: this album is more personal than the others in which too many people just can't seem to relate to but true loyal fans find each one of his songs a goldmine. i have been listening to seal long before his music got enough airplay to get recognized and this man has been truly been blessed. always in the beginning you just can't touch base until you come back again and listen and by that time you are hooked.

At least, Booker T won the title instead of that blonde headed fool Jeff Jarrett. Waitaminute, this is the Spanish version I am an American. Why does America have to keep on supporting illegal immigrants. Read this: uno, dos, tres cuatro #!$% you cinco, and the rest of your stupid language."
__label__2,"Pithy, cryptic, witty, mysterious, essence of Zen library: Green's translation seems to capture the frustrating, obvious, mocking, simple character of the lessons of the great Chinese Zen masters. Some of the prose is beautiful. Some is poetic. Some of it is deep like a pond with brilliant light reflected on its surface. The bigger the challenge, the bigger the reward."
__label__2,Doll: Bought this for my two year old daughter who loves dolls with yarn hair. She has enjoyed dragging it around the house. Very cute doll.
__label__1,Nothing Special: I thought this movie tried to be a lot like Seven. It saw the killer almost go to super human or ridulous lengths to be ultra crazy or ultra creepy. In the end it really didn't end up being anything special at all and I felt like I had seen this movie before. Defoe is good in his role and the rest of the cast was pretty good though Mick Foley proved only with a few lines that he is no actor. Not a great movie and really not that good either.
__label__2,"Bees a great read: As a Southerner reading this book brought back many memories. Well written and moving illustration of how ""family of choice"" can heal hurts from birth family."
__label__2,These Glasses are Perfect.: They came very quickly and Were packaged very well. I love them. They matched the other Dublin Crystal I have. Very Nice. I do recomend them.Ken Gore
__label__1,"Different version for the same item??: I bought one of these about a year ago, and bookmarked it so I could always come back and buy a duplicate. I just received my 2nd order of this today, and it's slightly different. The handle isn't fully leather, so it's not as stiff as the original book I ordered, and when you open it, the sides feel like the vinyl version of this book, so those things really kill it for me. It's a shame. I don't feel like going through the process of shipping it back because it's not the end of the world, but what is the deal with updating a product without updating the product page?"
__label__1,I would not buy from them again: I received Michael Kors Eau De Parfum 3.4 oz. It was wrapped in the box and looked new. However when I went to use it it leaked everytime I would spray it. Obviously it was tampered with- now I don't know what I'm spraying on myself. I will never buy from them again.
__label__1,"There's going to be a lot of head rolls...: This movie is great if you enjoy poverty but not great if you are looking to come up out of it. I felt this movie was a tedious romanticizing of poverty and starving to death in a bus in the middle of Alaska. Supertramp should have gone to Wall Street and lived a happy life. He comes to the conclusion that a writer must deny himself beautiful women and proper sanitation in order to be a true poet. I disagree with the entire premise. He just needed a proper girlfriend and some money, that is all. I hope aspiring writers don't try this home. Go to Wall Street and get a girlfriend who loves you, that's my advice."
__label__2,"One of the best seasons of the Simpsons: In my opinion this season ranks among the best, both in terms of overall episode quality and in standout, favorite-episode candidates. This season is very strong--there is hardly a weak or mediocre episode here--and makes for a great continuous viewing. On top of that, I count several of these episodes among my favorites. Kamp Krusty, Marge vs. the Monorail (donuts--is there anything they CAN'T do?), Homer the Heretic, and Homer's Triple Bypass (mmm..ham) are classics, and these are just some of the best in this spectacular season of one of America's greatest sitcoms."
__label__1,"maneaters: wrong title and if it had been the right title, i would have returned it anyway, because of such poor quality. thank you"
__label__2,Truth Will Get You All The Time: A must read ( and it was for many Americans). The truth about someone who was a hero in his own mind. A recount of what this ''officer'' did during his 4 months in Viet Nam and his use and abuse of policy for his own self interests not his fellow sailors.
__label__2,A chance at last!: I am so happy to this CD arrived today! We have followed Paul Potts since we saw his try out on YouTube. So happy that an every day kind of guy gets a change to prove himself. Way to go PAUL! Loved the CD.
__label__2,"Sony DCR-DVD308: Excellent video camera, small, handy, reliable. Somewhat slow when reading the disk but otherwise a very good choice. Good pictures"
__label__2,"Change is good.: I really liked the change that Good Charlotte has shown through this album. It's not full of boastful songs and immaturity, instead it's full of maturity and showing an actual reality. I didn't really like Good Charlotte at first but this CD is pretty good. They're not ""goth"" as someone suggested, that statement is out of proportion, but they are darker."
__label__1,"Bad Experience: I was very happy that after several months trying to get the money to buy the ultimate motherboard I decide to get this one, but for my surprise this mobo came with troubles, the first days I didnt push it because I was checking the overall performance and installing my application, after all was done I started to play some games and bang, system shutdown, I though that the problem was with something I connected so I disassembly everything and tried again, but then the nightmare started, CPU INIT all the way in the back LCD, and no way to get rid of it, then I start looking some info over the internet and there were a lot of people with the same problem, and with no real solution for this (than to RMA the item back to the seller) I not telling that this is not a good choice but I will think twice if I will buy a mobo from asus, this one disappoint me"
__label__2,"more than just a dictionary, more than just a grammar...: This dictionary is more that merely a dictionary with a grammar supplement in the back: The dictionary is highly integrated with the grammar tables, so that you can conjugate EACH verb, and decline EACH noun in all forms, all tenses, etc. Even Perfective and imperfective verbs are matched. I went through 4 semesters of college Russian with this dictionary, while all the other students follows the instructor's recommendation to buy the Oxford... I had a much easier time!If you live in a foreign country, your bookstore might carry only the hardcover pocket edition, but don't compromise -- get this edition.These days I use a Russian dictionary on my PC. It has a larger vocabulary and it's easier to search. But I STILL carry the Langenscheidt pocket dictionary around because of the grammar section."
__label__1,"Pick another Woodiwiss book: I was terribly disappointed with this book. I'm surprised that KEW wrote it. I would highly recommend Shanna (named my daughter after it), A Rose in Winter, and The Wolf and the Dove - all of which are classics worth reading again and again. Kathleen E. Woodiwiss will always be my favorite romance novelist because of the outstanding quality of the aforementioned books. Skip Petals on the River, though. As much as I loved the other books, I hated this one. Really the worst romance novel I've ever read."
__label__2,"Cant beat this product!!!: I did lots of research on tv calibration after i purchased my Samsung 850 52"" lcd. Both the big boxes offer services between the ranges of $150 to $300. I like doing things myself. This is not the easiest product in the world to use, you do need to be at lease a bit tech savvy, but if you understand how colors work, and can follow instructions you will do fine. This product makes a huge difference. Be prepared to sit down at night and spend a few hours. Working in a completely dark room helps this process along. If you really take your time to listen to the dvd instructions, and use some information from the internet on the color calibration side, you can get amazing results. The dvd comes with red green and blue filters, but dosent exactly explain how to properly use them. I found more detailed info on the internet for this section. Give it a try its only $<20."
__label__1,"Doesn't Work: This DVD doesn't work. I need to contact the company, but I am still looking for the paperwork. Hopefully I can get this resolved."
__label__1,"PATHETIC, EMBARRASSING NONSENSE: A pathetic attempt to discuss a theology that is beyond the mind of this embarrassing evangelical. Are any of these evangelicals educated beyond the level of Sunday School, floral smelling gift shops selling cute lamby toys and incense, and bible schools emphasizing rote learning and the deadening of the mind of anyone showing a grain of intelligence?"
__label__2,"Great book!: The book is pretty much like life, well for the popular rich kids. Yup the world of popularity pretty much revolves around great clothes, and style, and being a social butterfly, and being well a little or very spoiled. Coming from the regular side it's kind of fun to see how the other half lives, instead of some mean girls having fun all the time and being brats they are showing them as regular teenagers with lives other than glamorous and pulling schemes on Claire, and trying to get a boyfriend. Who knew popular kids have other emotions rather than hate and schemes and great taste in fashion??PS: This review sounds geeky.CHOKING HAZARD: if you have read the all of my stupid conversation you might laugh so hard at my idiocy and geekiness that you will choke and might possibly die.."
__label__2,"Lots of fun learning and experiencing for my 2 year old: My 2 1/2 year old enjoys playing with these fun fruits and vegetables. Here's what we received:Peach you can cut in half, you can see the pit inside.Banana you can peel three times.Orange you can peel four times and then cut into four segments.Cauliflower you can peel twice to get the greens off and then cut in half.Cabbage you can peel two outer leaves off.Ear of corn you can peel three times.Onion you can slice twice.Bean pod you can open to expose the beans.We did not receive the pineapple shown in some of the pictures. We still really like the set!My little one knew exactly what to do as soon as he saw the play knife and the fruits and vegetables. He has no trouble peeling but needs some help stabilizing the item he's cutting, I'm sure he'll get better with practice. He is mostly able to get them back together on his own. I like that he is able to recognize each item, they are realistic looking. This is a great learning toy!"
__label__2,"waterpic water flosser: This machine is fantastic. It replaces an old one that didn't stop working, the wand cracked and parts were not available since it was at least 30 years old. The only problem with the new one is the reservoir doesn't fit when it is turned over with the wand in place. You have to find a place for it on the counter and it will take up a lot of room if you travel. My teeth already look great and gums also and I am 71 years old.Controling the pressure-output- is great. On and off control could have beeen placed in a different place. Buy it! Buy it!"
__label__2,"Foyle's War, Simply the Best: Foyle's War is simply one of the best of the numerous British mystery series produced. As a fan of the genre I feel this is one of my all time top three series. Michael Kitchen is superb."
__label__1,"Not worth the effort: This is the sort of book that offers two things--a plot solution (who, what, why) and lots of history about turn-of-the-century New York. I lost interest in both before I was halfway through (I turned to the end to see if I'd missed anything and decided I hadn't). I can see where someone else might find both interesting, but that someone has to put up with a lot of wooden writing in the meantime. I don't like historical fiction in which the main effort is to introduce historical figures or incidents in clever ways. I'd rather read a biography or well-written history. I DO like historical fiction that presents a single person or incident with a freshness that makes them come alive again. This book failed to do that. Edith Pargeter is an example of a writer who does this very successfully."
__label__1,"heat sensor not accurate: The heat sensor on this unit is not accurate. For instance, I set it to 72 degree and when the unit starts, it gets really hot in the house that by the time it stops after the unit shows 73 degree, on the unit I took off, the reading easily goes above 80 degree. I have another thermostat in the house and the reading is also way above 72 degree."
__label__2,"Great roaster!: We put a 37# turkey in this roaster, covered it and cooked it all nite long. It came out beautifully browned and juicy and tender! We are well pleased with this roaster! It is deep enough to catch all the juices and the cover is high enough tocover a turkey that large--however I wouldn't want to try getting a turkey any larger than that. This one barely fit."
__label__1,five mile creek 20: we got this video and it was a bad quality. we tried to get it replaced but didn't get any response from the seller after several tries. we will not knowingly buy from this seller again.
__label__2,"Right on the Money: I read the other reviews of ""experts"" and ""critics"" slamming this book, claiming it's nonsense. But guess what...the book was right on the money! It acurately depicted the terrorist incident as well as the chemical and biological terrorism that we're seeing now. I noticed that these ""experts"" and ""critics"" have had nothing more to say since it really did happen as the author predicted. And let me tell you - I puckered up when I read the description of what happens to a person exposed to chemical agent."
__label__2,"Could not put it down!!: Wow, by the end of the first page your hooked!! An incredible story that each and everyone of us can relate to no matter what stage of our adult life we're in! From the sleaze and beauty of a small town and it's people to the turmoil of corporate america and the stuggle to find your palce in this mess. You'll get to know the good, bad, and ugly in those of us that have stuggeled to find where we belong. With the help of some spiritual gudiance we manage to make it through. A must read for all!"

__label__2,"Smooth and Mellow: My ears seriously disagree with the notion that this cartridge is a real ""snoozefest."" If you don't appreciate smooth, balanced, unforced and ""neutral"" (i.e mellow) sounding music (both classical and jazz) then this cartridge is definately not for you. No, it's not ""in your face"" by any means. What you hear is music, not the cartridge! There are plenty of other technically ""superior"" cartridge designs around, if you're willing to pay a premium for ""bragging"" rights. Why bother. Spend a few bucks less and ""brag"" about how good your music sounds with this one! Go for it!!"
__label__2,Excellent for nurses: This book is an excellent reference for nurses to use to communicate with their Hispanic patients. I had never taken any spanish courses before and the material in the book was easy to understand and the cds that came with it helped with correct pronounciation. I highly recommend it!
__label__2,"Excellent for the money: I have used a Wahl hairclipper for many years, but wanted one that was more portable and had guidecombs that would allow me to cut my hair a little longer. The Wahl model 9627 is compact and flexible. The guidecombs allow me to cut my hair up to 1 and 3/4 inches long. The unit can be used with or without a cord and the smaller size makes it easier to maneuver than larger ones. It does an excellent job of cutting hair. It does not appear to be as durable as my other Wahl clipper, but that is an acceptable tradeoff. It worked flawlessly out of the box and has a two yr warranty. The money I am saving on haircuts makes that a bargain."

__label__1,"Good movie bad game...: The movie included with this pack is an excellent action flick that will show of your home theatre system nicely. It isn't a movie that should be criticized on plot, etc. because in the end it wasnt going for an oscar award and simply trying to be a good action movie which it is. the special effects are very well done and the sound is also above average. Where this movie really shines is the picture quality. The widescreen edition's picture quality is perfect. i cant imagine how good the pan and scan version looks. However this pack does have its down side. and that is the poor quality of the video game of The Mummy Returns. Lets face it there arent that many good video games out there made after movies (exceptions being Goldeneye N64, possibly The World is not Enough N64). So in the end the high price on this pack probably isnt worth it, you should just get the DVD alone and save yourself the money"
__label__1,"Forget mystery..think Harlequin: This book was scare on mystery/thriller, and long on cheesy romance. If I want romance, I'll reaad a Harlequin!"
__label__1,"Below average lifespan: This cooling base looks good and has good features like nonslip pads and a ""lockaway storage"" for the USB cord when not in use. However only after 6 months it only works if I jigger the cord a certain way and at a certain angle. Three months later no matter how much I jigger or Fonzie smack it, the fan stops spinning. Kaput.I am very unsatisfied about it's performance as it as a short lifespan. Regret buying it and would not recommend."
__label__2,"drake and josh: i purchased this for my 7 year old neice, who loves Drake and Josh. I admit I have really enjoyed watching the series with her. It is nice to be able to share something we can talk about on her level that is not antimated."
__label__1,"Stopped working- common problem with no answer: I bought this player a few years ago and used it sparingly to record DVDs direct from camcorder DVI input. I was pleased with the many input options it supports including component, S-Video, and DVI. The disks created were playable 90% of the time. I used it to play other DVDs as well for the upconvert feature. Then suddenly one day, it stopped working. The unit displays an ""OPEN DISC"" message and never opens the disc tray. I have contacted Samsung support on numerous occassions with the resolve to be to go to a service center (for a fee of course). With as minimal usage as this thing had, this is a ridiculous break down. If it were more reliable, it would have been a great product."
__label__2,Great!: It was everything I exPected. It arrived on time. And it was brand new so worked perfectly. I love this series and have now completed it.
__label__2,"Mills is able to expand on topics already in the news: Kyle Mills writting is getting better with each book. He has the ability to take topics from the news and apply a different spin than most writters. His ability to incorporate reality and just enough paranoia, makes for captivating reading. I have recommended him to all my friends , and am looking forward to his next book. Also, at just over 300 pages, Mill's makes for a relaxing weekend read when time is of a premieum."
__label__2,THe big badddddd Batery EATER!!: So fare this mp3 player is OK! But there are 2 issues that really bug me!! These problems are that the maschine practily EATS the batterys!!! And it's SOOOO hard to get them out again!! otherwise this is the BEST mp3 player I have ever bought!! If your thinking of buying a 300-400 Dollor mp3 player PUT YOUR MONEY AWAY!!! Because this is a great player! the sound quality is awsome and the shocks are fine!
__label__1,"Overrated: After reading the reviews of this DVD set, I felt that I must get it. It sounded so great. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near good. Some reviewers say that the comedy is over people's heads. Yeah, no. The skit where someone is asking for change for a dollar is not over my head, it's just stupid. I didn't give this set the lowest rating(1 star) simply because Brian Posehn was cool and the incubator pants(they'll get you chicks) skit was cute. But that's one skit out of many. If you want truly awesome sketch comedy, try Kids in the Hall. They're hilarious, which is more than I can say for Bob and David."
__label__2,"An important read: Most of us (both men and women) who take the right to vote for granted have no way to comprehend the struggle it was for those who fought and won that right. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Susan B. Anthony's own words from the beginning of her work with her friend and fellow reformist Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the mid 1800s to her death in 1906. As a secondary school student, I remember her name being mentioned occasionally, but I had no appreciation of the dedication and determination of this remarkable woman who was truly a pioneer in the women's movement in America.A compelling, important read."
__label__1,"Plot? What plot?: I went through about half of this series expecting it to go somewhere, and it never did. Although the animation was pretty for the first two or three times you see Kaze, nothing ever really progresses plot-wise for the first couple dozen episodes. The characters never show any development, and nothing is ever properly explained.I wouldn't waste your money or time on this series."
__label__1,"2025???: This DVD drops in 2025? Isn't a seventeen year preorder a bit long? Won't DVDs be collectors items by then? Well I guess if I survive the Rise of the Machines, the Clone Wars, the melting of the ice caps, and the Clinton2 presidency I can look forward to Nicotina."
__label__1,This book really freaked my 5 year old out: Yesterday this book was read at my daughter's YMCA program and she has not smiled in the last 24 hours. She will not even discuss the book and is very disturbed by it. Luckily she did not have nightmares. I am telling the YMCA staff to not read this to younger children. Not reccomended.
__label__2,"Take the Spiral Journey: This MP3 album is cerebral new age. Great for meditation or a late night listening experience. I heard ""Hale-Bopp"" on XM Audio Visions Channel 77 one night I decided to purchase the entire album. This music is for anyone who likes to reflect, meditate or do some deep thinking."
__label__1,"Race-bashing: Gee. This show makes it look like negroes love fried chicken! Outrageous stereotyping!How is it that reverse racism beats straight out racism?!Race bashing. Revenge? Wow.There is the token ""cool"" white person though.Honestly, ""Mississippi Burning"" is a viable movie about racism in the past. Strong, unlike The Help, which is so repulsive and weak. Liberal Hypocrites enticing one another into self-righteous indignation."
__label__1,"if it sounds too good to be true.......: it is too good to be true. Do not waste your money on the hype of a natural cure. If there were one, the public would be aware.

__label__2,"sci fi: My husband and me enjoy this movie, even when were out and we make a comment that was from that movie we say it in their context. It's gone McReady.We have always enjoyed this movie."
__label__1,"Enough is Enough: This is one of the worst movie of the century. The plot was awful, and the acting was atrocious. J-Lo can not act, and she should stick to rapping with Ja-Rule,if she wants to be in the spot light. Do not waste your time, energy, and money on this rated ""D"" movie. If you suffer from insomnia, plug in this DVD and I guaranteed that you will be cured."
__label__2,"Suchet great;photography unappealing: I agree-the price is way too high.Suchet is great,butthe photography is unappealing on older equipment.Fuzzy,[like the lens was dusty/foggy] and dark.I'm surprisedmore reviewers haven't mentioned this. I do miss Ms.Lemon,Inspector Japp (it's misleading to have them mentionedin the ""headlines""). I appreciate having the subtitles."
__label__2,"A dark, bleak progression: This album is certainly not a radical departure from MDB's past.Pretty much, it is what we come to expect from the band these days, well thought out, well constructed music that expresses its own bleakness and cynicicism towards human emotional endeavors.I can say that the follwing tracks in particular caught my attention: ""Wreckage of my Fkesh"", and ""My Wine in Silence""Overall this is definately a good album, even a very good album, but I am unsure at this stage just how sustained the listening enjoyment will be, and unfortunately each song has just enough in common with the others on this album that it doesn't stand out and demand the attention that it may deserve."
__label__1,not durable enough: The paint wears away rather quickly from use. Then the metal chips/flakes off and leaves residue inside your firearm. I wish they weighed more to simulate carrying live ammo. Too expensive for what your getting. Sorry.
__label__1,"Thank God this was NOT out when I was single: I gave this book one star because it's legible. That's the only good thing I can say about it. Thank God that it wasn't out in the 1980s, when my husband and I were dating. In those days, we spent a lot of time ""breaking up and making up"". The guy who wrote this book, had he known me then, would have told me that my guy ""just wasn't into me"". And like a dummy, I would have believed him. Then I would have cheated myself out of the best thing I've had in this life - the guy that I was always breaking up with! Not to mention the twelve wonderful years of marriage we've had since then and our two beautiful children.I urge all of you young single women to quit buying self-help books like this and have the guts to listen to your own heart. Yes, I know Oprah endorsed this. I like Oprah, but she does not rule my world and she should not control yours! Listening to your heart and following it is never easy, but unlike this book, it will never steer you wrong."
__label__2,"A delightfully entertaining film: Unlike most 'gay movies', TRICK doesn't attempt to preach or make some ""big statement"". It's jsut a nice film about a typical kid in a big city, who catches the eye of a Go-Go Boy in one of the local dance clubs (well OK, New York may not be a 'typical' city, but despite the stereotype, not all gay kids in NYC are millionaires).It's a ""date film"", and after meeting up, the two boys try to find a place to get cozy & intimate with each other. There's no more 'sex' here than you'll find in any straight-couple movie , and I guess it shows that, when all's said & done, gay dating isn't a whole lot different than straight dating.While I suspect that most people reading this have already seen the film at least once, I won't ruin the ending for those who have not -- except to say that you'll be glad you wtched the whole film.Not a classic or a masterpiece, but a big breaktrough for gay films; gay boys are not wierd--in fact, the boy next door might be one. Happy viewing!"
__label__1,"Violent thriller that pushes ""ridiculous"" to the max: After a brutal and depressing start, this violent, suspenseful revenge thriller--disguised as a subpar meditation on the morals of the legal system--became fairly engaging. Even as the plot spiraled into the realm of the ridiculous, I just held on tight, awaiting what I hoped would be a terrific and shocking finale. But this rollercoaster just sputters to a grinding halt before bursting into flames in one of the worst endings I have ever seen in this genre.The end result is a fairly decent hour-long suspense vehicle sandwiched between fifty extra minutes of nothing special--a dreary, uncomfortable start and an absurd conclusion. This is not the kind of film I would ever likely revisit, so at best I could only recommend it as a rental. And even then, it would be a lukewarm recommendation because there are many other films that deliver the same moral message in a much better, more convincing manner."
__label__2,"everyone is crazy: this is one of the hottest albums to drop this whole entire year. everyone thinks that ja sucks but he doesn't. he is the rap superstar, though under appreciated, he IS better than 50 cent. This CD is mad crazy, especially with the featured Hussein Fatal. This is well worth the money. My favorite tracks on this CD are THE LIFE and THINGS GON' CHANGE, they are both hot. all the other songs are good too though. i have been a die hard ja rule fan for ever, since i heard holla holla. if people would just listen to his voice and lyrics you would like him too. BUY it, listen to it, like it. peace"
__label__1,"Forbes Is Boring: I am not a professional investor, but I decided to give Forbes a chance. I have found the magazine to be pretty boring and dry. I like to read more about what is happening currently in the stock market with individual stocks and this magazine has more articles in it. I found that a lot of the articles couldn't keep my interest. Would recommend getting The Wall Street Journal or Smartmoney before Forbes."
__label__2,Perhaps the best in the Die Hard franchise: Bruce Willis really is at his best in Live Free or Die Hard. The movie is just the perfect action film except for one scene (where Bruce is attacked by a F35 fighter aircraft) which borders on ridicule.
__label__2,Great book: This is surely one of the best books ever written about cognitive science.The author makes it very clear from the beggining that it is a compilation of other books and studies... But what a piece of compilation!It has an extensive and very useful bibliography for anyone interested on deepening his/her knowledge about the many subjects of the book.
__label__1,"POOR QUALITY: This would be a nice bit of kit, but after only three uses the stitching came apart where the belt goes through the loop. For the price, I expected much better. If the stitching had held together, I would have given it a much better review. I haven't contacted the seller because it's just too much hassel to get things shipped to Europe. If you can get one that the stiching will hold, it is a nice bit of kit with plenty of room. I probably just got a poor one."
__label__1,"very poorly made: It's a waste of money. The minute I opened the box, I was sorry that I paid for it. it needs assembly but this was not the bad part. the bad part was that one of the wires that holds the 2 levels from underneath snaped and broked right when i opend it. so the cart lost it's balance and it's unusable.I would not recomend this product to anyone."

__label__1,"Horrible: Seemed like a good idea at the time, but I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed in a product. Right out of the box it worked okay, but within a week it was useless. Just no suction whatsoever. Forget using the extension hose; you can put your hand right against the opening and barely feel it. Wish I'd never wasted the money on this-- it's going right out to the trash and I've only used it about 3 times."
__label__1,"Unhappy: I was not aware that this DVD was 1 part of a whole series. It did not mention that, so when I got it, expecting to learn alot of things, I found that they would tell me ""and we covered this in the last DVD..."" so there was so much info I missed out on by not having seen the rest of the series. Was pretty disaapointed, do not think its worth it to buy the ENTIRE series to learn everything, much too pricy in these economic times."
__label__2,"Great Little Camera: This was a great purchase. My wife and I love to take photographs, but it is a pain having to lug around our SLR if we plan on doing things other than take photos all day, especially on vacations.We took this camera to Hawaii with us and were very happy with it. Get a 2GB card and you can take almost 600 pictures at the highest quality setting, and the different exposure settings are fun to experiment with (especially the sunset setting)."
__label__2,"a little something different: Conservatives beware! This is a book about people who willfully choose not to follow the straight and narrow. I guess you could treat it as a cautionary tale (don't want to give it away, so I'll leave it at that), but it's so much deeper than that. A book of ideas-and what some might deem ""dangerous"" ones. I loved it!"
__label__1,"Piece of crap.: I bought this a while ago but as soon as I did it was crap, the stickers are oriented incorrectly. They feel off easily. When I received it it was unattached from the key chain. Is it cheep? Yes. Does that mean it's worth it? No."
__label__1,"not much information: If you don't have A LOT of martial arts experience, this video is pretty advanced. Showed some basic stuff to do with the fans, but I was expecting more ideas of things to do, how to build a elegant yet intimidating weapos form. That said, I like the fans and since the video have figured out that basically any move you do you can incorporate the fans."
__label__1,unhappy loop user: I bought it to use on my new bose radio thinking it would help to bring more stations. but it never changed it at all.
__label__1,other flavors are better: This one is not my favorite. It kind of tasts like kaopectate. The banana and the chocolate are much better... but it is 35 grams of protein
__label__2,Cult classic: I've loved this movie since the first time that I saw it. I just purchased the second one and hope that it lives up to the first one!
__label__2,Fame: I almost didn't get this to play on my bluray player. I may need a firmware upgrade. Anyway the movie was good however I was thinking there would be more dancing in the movie....from what I remember from the older one. also the girl that was on 'so you think you can dance' really wasn't in the movie very much and that was a big advertising point for the movie.
__label__2,"Good Case: Thought it was a little on the cheap side when I first got it, but after using it, I think it will suit my needs pretty well. Would like to see a little more padding all around. Am thinking of buying a sleeve to give it a little more padding.fits a 15.6"" screen with room for a mouse and power cords. Like the fact that you can use the computer without taking out of the case. Adequate storage for pens and such. Will have to see how it holds up, but don't think you can beat it for the price. Save your receipts, packing says it comes with a 25 year quality guarantee."
__label__1,"Looks Good on the Outside But...: I actually got this player through a rewards program. Perhaps the QC technicians were on brake when my unit was on the line. It is poorly made. It worked OK at first but after the 5th time of using it, the picture went out; just white and black lines appeared. I had to tap it on the back of the screen to make the picture come back. To this day I have to do this. One of these days its just going to stop working all together I suspect. I have to be careful how I tilt the screen. If its not just right, the display will go out; black and white wavy lines.Please, do yourself a favor. Pick something else out of the rewards catalog.rjb"
__label__1,"A cure for Insomnia: If this book doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will. Full of vague and windy generalities, and incredible repetition, you won't find out much of anything. But you will be bored."
__label__2,"A sweet romance.: This was a wonderfully sweet story. Never before has a romance author brought to light the terrible plight girl children of China faced upon their birth. Sometimes I felt Jamie spoiled Ruby and that the girl could have used a little more discepline then she got, which was none at all. But given Jamie's tragic past one can forgive his spoiling the child that could ""literally"" be credited with saving his life. A wonderful story and well worth the read."
__label__2,"great table!: Wow, I do like this table A LOT! Very nice weight to the top; was worried about the base, as it seemed too lightweight. However, once assembled, it turned out fine. One problem, the directions were not all they could be. I had problems with the cam locks when I followed the directions. I managed to fix it by inserting the cam locks in place all the way PRIOR to putting the top on -- very important! The directions tell you to insert the cam locks after the top is in place and it is impossible to finish the assembly if you do it that way. Also, put the top opening the wrong way the first time; but after 45 minutes(on my own) I got a great looking table! It is a nice oak color; very close to the picture but not as 'red' as the picture."
__label__2,"Hilarious!: I am a 16 year old girl and I am a HUGE Broadway fan. This is the first cababret album I've heard (I dont even know what cabaret is exactly) but I heard it not knowing what to expect and I was cracking up at every song! Especially ""The Babysitters Here"" It was so true! I'm running right out to get it! Its one of those albums that just put you in a good mood and put a smile on your face."
__label__1,"nice book but boring through the half way point: This book started off really nice, but halfway through you would be waiting for something exciting to happen or you could tell what would happen. The ending was soooooo corny and lame. i read the first two books in the series, but this book really puts to shame this series. talk about a way to make a good book terrible! Please take my advice, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
__label__2,"Excellent exhibition catalog: This is an excellent catalog of an exhibition sponsored by the Tate Gallery in 1994. There are about 115 full-page color reproductions of good quality, interspersed with commentary on selected pieces by the artist. An interesting, satisfying overview of a contemporary artist who's apparently had his ups and downs with the critics."
__label__2,"If you like Chevy Chase, then ""Fletch"" is a must-have movie.: ""Fletch"" offers a wonderfully exciting plot fueled by Chase's one-liners and his hilarious identites. Just plain funny."
__label__2,"Purchase of DVD from ecom: Product arrived earlier than expected, in A1 condition. Couldn't ask for more efficient service. Thanks ecom."
__label__1,"Universal Remote Control: The Philips PM4S 4 device Universal Remote Control is a nice looking remote. It is easy to program with one drawback. The list of devices is somewhat extensive. It is easy to connect with different devices once they are programed.The one disadvantage that I have found is that some television sets are not in the programing instructions, and the auto program feature does not work well with the unlisted set I had. I was not able to program that tv into the remote control. I would have to think twice before recommending tis item to others."
__label__1,Light skinned Negro without dialect wins presidency: The story of a light skinned Negro with a sometimes Negro dialect yearns to be president. It is well written with some inspiring moments.He did become our first colored president but I don't think this book is worth the time and effort and money but I can see that some disagreed by rating it five stars.
__label__1,"Emotional Purity: an Affair of the Heart: The book was disappointing. First of all, it is not well-written. Second, it appears that she's propagating her own beliefs for which supporting research and convincing evidence is lacking. Her premise is valid, however, the way it is presented seems irrelevant in today's world"
__label__2,How it works.: To me the main criteria of any software product is how intuitive it is. This product falls in the top category. I was up and running fast and producing drawings. I am now assimulating the finer points to be more productive.
__label__1,"There are better books on Pinehurst than this.: I've been reading golf books for thirty years and this one has to be in the top five of the worst I've ever read. As I was reading this I noticed that I was reading the same paragraph, word for word, only in different chapters. If you want to read good books on Pinehurst stick with anything by Lee Pace."
__label__2,"A great film!: Looks like yet another Disney hit!Beautiful animation,memorable songs and a great plot will keep you glued to the screen!Scar and the hyenas are gret villains,and timon and Pumbaa are great as comic relief!This film is one you should definately have in your Disney video collection!"
__label__2,"Does what I needed it to: I bought this scale to keep careful track of a family member's weight after she had major surgery. It was important to be able to see even the slightest weight gain, and this scale does just that with the increments it shows."
__label__1,"Good printer, serious shortcomings: I have had other Brother printers and they have been great. I hoped for the same and am disappointed. Although this printer was easy to set up, the scanning software was easy to figure out, the print quality is excellent, the printer simply does not print envelopes properly. No matter what I do, the envelope is always creased and bent when it comes out of the printer. I have never had this problem before, even with other brands which have not been as high performing as Brother, so I do not understand how the problem can be so serious. But I would not have bought this printer if I had known it did not have the capacity to print standard sized envelopes!"
__label__1,"very slow middle 1/3 .: Very slow mid 1/3. Way too much about how HOT it is in south west Texas in the summer, we know that.The end finally picked up however.I will continue reading Lee Child books ,because I like all the others---7 of them."
__label__2,"Basic N Gauge loop: These did what it said. The Kato track is great, doesn't come apart like other brands. Now I understand why one hobby store spoke so highy about this track."
__label__1,"Completely Worthless: I can't believe that this book made it past the editors. It is so trite, so predictable, so cliche ridden with characters that are one dimensional and very unbelievable. This book asks that you suspend any critical examination of the likelihood of its plot with reality. Very disappointing, but the best part of the book was that it was a library book that I didn't buy and it was short. After Caucasia I was hoping for Ms. Senna to return with another captivating novel, but not this time. Check it out from your local library if you must, but don't waste the money on it."
__label__2,"Great book for the family: I actually only bought this book because ecom had it ""linked"" to David Chartrand's book ""A View from the Heartland,"" which I had bought earlier. Both are wonderful, wonderful books that should be read by everyone! Both Albom and Chartrand show us how the average, normal person finds meaning and purpose and value in his or her life. I wish both authors a lot of luck and hope both books get wide circulation."
__label__1,"Why one star?: The only reason i gave this game 1 star is cause i havent played it just like everyone else in the reviews. First off dont listen to what these people say cause they have never played the game before. I have WM2K and yes the game rules. If i were writing a review for that game it would have got a 5, but im not im writing it for this game ""WHICH NONE OF YOU HAVE EVER PLAYED"". Rent the game first then see how you like it, after that come here and write a review. Just dont write a review about something you've only seen pics of."
__label__2,fantastic: i didn't know about rialto yet. i was just passing by london and listened to a few tracks in a store. i bought it and i am sure it was one of the best records i've ever bought.
__label__1,"Inaccurate and irresponsible: As a neurologist, I am appalled by the medical inaccuracies in this book and by how out of date even the most basic recommendations are. Using sheets and blankets in a crib is just the most basic example of how woefully incompetent these writers are. They should have their medical licenses yanked and their children removed to foster care.As a working woman, I am also dismayed. This book could be subtitled, ""How to be a slave to your baby."" In it we learn that mothers should stay at home and cloth diapers with pins are the the way to go. It is misogynistic and painful to read.Bottom line: If you want to bring a MRSA infection home to your baby, this is the book for you."
__label__1,"spa silk: Not true to size, after few washes fabric doesn't stay nice. Shrunk in the dryer.First couple of wears were nice."
__label__1,"Inspirational: ""Killing Floor"" should be an inspiration to any aspiring writer. If this book could get published (and sell), anything can."
__label__1,"Worthless: Worthless and waste of time and money. There is no great strategies discussed in the book, book is throughout boring and repeating. Author sees the reader as a potential customer. You have a feeling that you were listering to a salesman aggressively trying to sell his products."
__label__2,"Always Brilliant...: I have enjoyed reading this book and look forward to the next two in this trilogy. I will say the book has not been as ""captivating"" as some of Marquez's other titles, but since I love this writer, I will continue to seek out and read his writings! The rich history he decribes of Colombia is fascinating!"
__label__2,Must Have This Book!: To keep it simple...THIS IS THE BOOK!!!You'll only need one. Learn everything in this book!Easy to read and lots of examples.You won't be disappointed!
__label__2,"It's not Mad Max,: I don't quite know where they're going with that. It's more like sin City. it doesn't have the budget but I like the story and the narration. I'm so tired of Vampire or ghost movies so this is a breathe of fresh air. Long live the independent film."
__label__1,"terribly cheap...piece of junk: I realize this toy was only $30, but this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. I put this together exactly like the instructions said and tighten everything good and snug, and the thing fell apart in my hands as I was putting it together. They use little rubber grommets instead of clips to hold shafts in place. These grommets fall off before you even get it together. I had an erector set when I was a child, and thought that it would be a great gift for my children to play with. But this toy is nothing like the one i had as a child. The poor quality of this product is absolutely disgusting and I would never buy another product from this company again. I would not recommend this toy or any other products from this company to anyone."
__label__2,"Mencken, The Shakespeare of the Sardonic: Author Henry Miller lists Mencken's Prejudices series (which was published in six volumes) as one of the ""hundred books which influenced me most"" in his famous list subjoined to ""The Books In My Life."" Having just completed reading a tattered copy of volume one, I can say in all sincerity that I have rarely enjoyed a book more. Prejudices is a compilation of Mencken's literary and theatrical critiques, and on display are his unparalleled lexicon, his sardonic wit, his exasperation with human incompetance and pomposity, and his appreciation for the rare instances of human greatness. If you have a good sense of humor and despise political correctness, settle down on the sofa and relish one of his 10 to 20 page vignettes. This is as close to nirvana as you can come with a book, but be forewarned! Keep your dictionary very handy until you have mastered Mencken's hilarious vernacular."
__label__2,"If you hook it up correctly, no problem: I was somewhat frustrated when this product wouldn't work when I plugged it into the spare USB port on my keyboard. I tried loading and unloading the software many times. I was so frustrated that I considered returning the reader. Then my wife, who actually took the time to read the instructions carefully, pointed out the fact that I had not plugged the device directly into one of the computer's USB ports or into a ""powered"" USB hub. Once I plugged into the powered hub I was up and running in no time (much to the delight of my wife and my personal embarassment). The download speeds are great. No more waiting almost one minute per picture for a serial download from my digital camera. Now all of the images pop up in seconds. What a timesaver. Guess this proves the addage ""if all else fails, read the instructions."" Carefully."
__label__2,Top Notch!: I got this the other day and I must say the reviews are all true. The product is rock solid and best of all the sound coming from this is better than some of the $70+ headphones. The headphones are a bit hard to put on but mind you that once you have it on it will probably never come loose no matter how much you walk or run plus it doesn't mess up your hair. Highly recommended!
__label__1,Marine Corps: Found this account accurate and personal. Found names of former Marines that I served with. Great resource for Marines.
__label__1,"Buggy without a patch: This game has been out now for 6 months. It has suffered from numerous bugs from the VERY FIRST DAY! There has not been a single patch released from IG.It is my opinion that once they've made their money, they don't care. There is not any profit in fixing the broken games they sell.If it weren't for the bugs and lack of tech support/patches this would be a 4 or 5 star game."
__label__1,"Dangerously Misinformed: This doctor (and never has the title been applied so liberally) claims that the withdrawal method is 96% effective at preventing pregnancy, has an entire chapter explaining how to use the rhythm method (all the widely loudly protesting that it isn't the rhythm method), and equates male circumcision with state sponsored sexual abuse. She also references Dr. Laura Berman, the former champion of ""Female Sexual Dysfunction."" This disorder has now been widely debunked as a drug biz marketing tool. When a medical professional openly sponsors this kind of falsehood and nonsense, and references other doctors who make a living spouting falsehood and nonsense, how are we to trust anything she says? I would highly recommend leaving this one in the warehouse and finding some literature you can trust."
__label__1,A HATE NOVEL: This book make you understand that it is not so difficult to believe how Armenians were used against Ottoman Turks by French and British spies to kill innocent Turks during the WW I and got punished for doing so. This ethno-centric garbage is one of the worst anti-Middle Eastern books I have ever read. Thank god I did not have to pay for it. If you got time and money to waste by all means purchase this book.
__label__1,Junk: The bag is extremely hard to put in. The latch broke to shut the unit broke. The bags are very hard to find in the stores must order on line.The suction power died after just a few uses. Do not buy this unit.
__label__2,"Worked like a charm: Very light and easy to carry in my backpack. My little girl was in the midst of a city street party and there was nowhere to go...she didn't think twice about using the Potette. Only problem is that the absorbent pad wasn't absorbent enough. In future, we will carry one of our left over diapers to place in bottom of bag."
__label__1,"Too awful to be funny: I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare"
__label__2,"Montana Turkey Decoy: These are excellent decoys. they are so easy to cary and set up, unlike the older full bodied style. They easily fit iinto your vest pocket and can be set up in seconds. I'm very pleased with them.Tony212"
__label__1,"You get what you pay: Shipped pretty quickly. Plugged it into my car and it worked for 2 hours before one port quit working and it only took a day for the other to give out. Cheap enough for an experiment, but save yourself the hassle and pay the extra money for a quality one."
__label__2,GREAT CD: WADE HAYES WAS A GREAT SINGER AND THE REASON I CHOSE THIS RATING WAS CAUSE OF THE PRICE AND I JUST LOVE THE MUSIC ON THE CDWOULD TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO BUY THIS CD
__label__2,"THE ULTIMATE VANHALEN SLEEPER ALBUM: It's amazing that as good as this album is, it is not nearly as well known as their debut or say... 1984. Not one throw-away song can be found here. It sounds more polished than the previous 3 albums but still has a raw aggresion.Arguably VH's best album, although their debut is hard to beat. If you love guitar rock, GET THIS ALBUM!"
__label__2,"Page turner!: What an awesome book! I couldn't put it down--the first chapter was captivating! This book opened my eyes up to what goes on in the spirit world. There are constant battles over our souls and this book expose the secret to winning the battle. We hold the power and victory once we confess Jesus as Lord and utilize His name and blood. Wow, this was a bible lesson and spiritual awaken all in one book. I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel!"
__label__2,"Good Book- Medical Thriller: I really thoroughly enjoyed this book. Toby was a good main character to the problems that were faced in the ER. It was interesting how dr. carl wallenberg was opposing her so much of the time! To find out more, read the book!"
__label__2,"The Party, starring Peter Sellers: I found ""The Party"" with Peter Sellers even funnier than ""The Pink Panther"". Peter, as a self-effacing, smiling, incredibly polite, and immaculately dressed Indian gentleman stumbles by mistake into an elegant party. What happens next is almost unbelievable!"
__label__1,"So corny!: I'm thrilled I only purchased this DVD for $5 at Target because that's about what it's worth! The graphics are so cheesy and low budget, the music is annoying, and the ""ring master"" looks like he's spent one too many days on the beach inhaling helium gas. It is horrible! If you can get past the corniness and bad quality, there is *some* educational value. But, in my opinion, there are much better DVD options than this. Elmo goes to Preschool and Signing Time's ABC DVDs are far better, very very educational, entertaining, and most importantly, will not encourage parents to pray for an aneurysm after watching the movie."
__label__2,"Good Headphones: Everyone's heard of the expression ""you get what you pay for"". However, in this case, you actually get more than you pay for. These headphones are surprisingly better than I thought they would be. the in-ear design makes it great for excessing because the headphones stay in your ears better and it cancels out sound better. The only flaw I could find with this product is the fact that the cord is actually a bit longer than normal headphones. Some may find this to be good; although, I think that too much cord is just more to worry about."
__label__1,"Rubber band!: I bought that pair of shoes because they were ""big bargain"". But what I really doubt is how an expensive pair of shoes has its slingback made of...Rubber band! yes, Rubber band, not covered, not painted, a simple rubber band like the one you use at office and for packing purposes!"
__label__2,Soooo good: I found this in a store but then they discontinued it where I am. It is a great alternative to hot chocolate or coffee. Not to sweet and has great flavor.
__label__1,Horrible!!: I bought this item hoping it would help me but it doesnt even work. Both disc wouldnt play for me so I really dont know if this is a good workout or not
__label__1,"Excitement turns to Sadness: I was initially happy that I had found this classic clock. I always keep a wind up clock next to my alarm and use it anytime the weather indicates the possibility of high winds or inclement weather so I know I have a working alarm clock. The generous size and strength of the bells was certain to wake me. Unfortunately, when it arrived, the hour hand was broken and would not keep time. I looked at it to see if I could fix it but it was sealed and I could not see the inner workings. I contacted the shipper via ecom and let them know of the condition it arrived in. They were accommodating and processed a refund in a timely fashion. I was disappointed that I could not get a replacement clock and my only option was a refund, but they were timely in that. In the future I will continue to look for a similar clock, but that will be another review"
__label__1,"fillers, all of 'em: Seriously, since book 3, all of them have been an 80% retelling of the previous installments and 20% new stuff.If i wanted to read the previous book, why bother buying this one? I've had it, I'm throwing the towel.The Christ Clone Trilogy managed to pack all its content into 3 small books. And seems like left behind isn't offering anything that christ clone trilogy did not. At this rate, it wouldn't surprise me if the series was 'left behind' by more readers before it reached its conclusion."
__label__2,"interesting read: interesting to hear the scientific support/explanations for some of what occurred. it's not always a matter of ""you just have to believe it"" when there is a valid explanation for it. this book provides a lot of that insight, answer some of those questions."
__label__2,"feels right in the hands: I like almost everything about the C-3040. It is indeed, user friendly, very well thought-out.unlike the Nikon coolpix 995, which i also own. with the Olympus, i can make onboard computer changes quite fast.but.......with the type of photography i do, the camera fails.the problems that the C-3040 and other digital cameras have , that should come to an end quite soon, i hope, are; 1)slow computer speed after a shot has been taken.and 2)have to use a lower quality picture mode to stop action, under low light conditions. (like SQ1) you will get grain . what's the sense of having a 3 or 4 meg camera when you can only get that quality under ideal shooting conditions?"
__label__2,"Works well, but have a backup.: This watch mostly works as promised. As one of the previous reviewers stated, without enough sleep, it doesn't wake me up, but usually I can hear it with at least 6 hours of good sleep, (and I have some hearing loss). I usually wake up feeling well rested with the alarm, as opposed to nearly comatose with any other alarm."
__label__2,"best yet: As a zombie movie fan I must say this is my favorite season so far. This season's first episode was zombie fan heroin. Blood letting frenzy. Still some of the drama, but the payoff is there. Survival atmosphere with common sense. Lovin it so far (3 episodes)."
__label__1,"blah: What a waste of the second half of my vacation week. Hateful, annoying people bickering all over the place. A convoluted, ridiculous plot that manages to be very boring. I also wished it would just return to Ursula and Pel's bickering rather than any of the workplace stuff, and yet when it got back to a bickering scene, I wanted that to end, too. These people deserve each other, but I don't deserve this."
__label__2,"Club Pro Ab Trainer Review: I first used the Ab Trainer in the Anaheim Hilton hotel workout facility. As soon as I tried it, I decided to buy one. This is a very solid and effective piece of equipment. It is the only piece of home exercise equipment I own. I work out almost daily in a gym, but I still use the Ab Trainer because it does a better job of isolating the stomach muscles than the crunch benches. Whereas I can do 400 crunches on a bench, I can do half that with the Ab Trainer.I thought the assembly instructions were a bit obtuse. It took several tries to get the thing together, and I ended up relying more on the photograph of the equipment than on the instruction diagram."
__label__2,"Lots of good information.: All in all this is a very good book, I looked at alot of books on the subject, and this is the best. Lots of good pics, concise, well written, easy to understand explanations of everything from wiring a fixture, to building the service panel.My only reason for not giving it 5 stars, was the lack of good info on how to use electronic testing devices, and troubleshooting. But in all fairness none of the books I looked at did. You can't go wrong with this book."
__label__2,"Great Mystery for all You Hitchcockians: Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) plays a bad guy. That's the only bummer in this Hitchcock mystery. James Stewart has the lead role. They don't make mysteries like this anymore. HD movie makes the difference on my 55"" screen. It creeps you out like you're right there. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. See if you can see Alfred Hitchcock in the opening few scenes. He made a cameo in all the movies he directed if you didn't know that bit of trivia."
__label__1,"garbagex9: This movie was boring and whack again like all the friday the 13th movies were, wow not even close he just blew up and a stupid black guy ate some of his remaining's and he turned into what jason was a evil phyco this movie was so whack."
__label__1,DO NOT BUY THIS: These knives are terrible! They started rusting on day 2 after we started using them and we hand-wash them too! Very very disappointing product... Don't waste your money on this poor quality and immediately rusting ripoff!
__label__1,Book was never published - it doesn't exist: This edition was never published therefore it doesn't exist and should not be listed.
__label__2,"Liberating effect of Russian Revolution: This is the book to find out about the impact of the Russian Revolution in the U.S., before Stalinism. Cannon was the most important of the original American communist leaders-and a great writer to boot. In his easy and colorful style, he focuses on the critical importance of the Russian Revolution for his generation of working class militants. Those who rallied to its banner gave a vital impetus to all later fighters for social change. Among the most valuable lessons are how the communists defended all class-war prisoners, regardless of their adherence to communism, including the story about Big Bill Haywood and the International Labor Defense. Also interesting, is Cannon's appendix on the ""Negro Question"" (as it was then known). I'm convinced by his thesis-that the Russian Revolution and the existence of a U.S. communist party had a liberating effect on the Black struggle in the 1920s."
__label__1,"I'm inpartial to this one...: When I saw that I could rent this before it came out in the theaters I was very intriged. I purchased it for rent from my Tivo and 30 minutes later I started watching it. I really thought that since it was a Robin Williams movie it would be very good. And I can't say I hated it but it really wasn't what I thought it would be.The movie is somewhat dark and revovles around an unfortunate, accidental death that is used to revolve the story around. It's about using others misfortune for ones gain. It was an interesting movie, however its not the type of movie that I am used to seeing Robin Williams in.In the end, do I recommend seeing it? I do. But I would wait for it to be available on sale, it's one of those that is worth seeing if you can get it at a good deal, but not one where you should pay a premium to watch."
__label__2,"Very informative: Chillingly, this Biography episode was put together shortly before 9/11 when Bin Laden was not on too many average radar screens. However, in one hour, it manages to sum up his life and relates his amazing background as the son of a billionaire construction magnate who could have led a more productive life. Instead, we see the roots of Bin Laden's radicalization. At least, we now understand something of why he turned out the way he did. This show is still well worth watching for its meticulous look at the early life of a monster."
__label__1,"A big waste of time: One of the comments on this book that is printed on the back cover goes like ""The Da Vinci code for people with brains"". This book is anything but. About 10% of the book is centered about a mystery code hidden in some ancient novel. The remaining 90% of the book is an endless, meandering rambling about the life and life history of four students in Princeton. Unlike the Da Vinci code, you don't get to see any puzzle at all; at various points, parts of the code are revealed and the final climax is underwhelming. Don't waste your time with this book."
__label__1,"MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT!: This movie starts out slow, continues to be slow, and then, finally, it ends slow. there is no point and it has a horrible plot line. It is a nasty movie in the sense of sexual content."
__label__1,"YOU NEVER REALLY GET INVOLVED IN THE STORY: The author's choice of characters and the writing style don't amplify much suspense or interest. Instead, you feel like a detached observer and never really get involved. The lead character was so superficially developed and his love interest was so predictable, you wonder why the author even bothered. The climax was so tedious and exhausting, it leaves you wondering how this could have come about. The greatest tragedy is that the virus is brought about so well at the start of the novel but by the time the climax unfolds it has remarkably become secondary to the novel--something that shouldn't really have happened. Better plot construction, and a more carefully thought out story line could have done wonders for this book. As it is, there are many other books that are far better than this one..."

__label__2,"Low-budget masterpiece: What is it about some films? The plot may be simplistic, the acting cardboard, and the cinematography amateurish, but still you love it! The Warriors is just such a flick. This saga of a Coney Island street gang trying to make it home through countless layers of hostile enemies combines action and high tension with a powerful underlying theme. Well worth watching over and over."
__label__2,"Worth purchasing: I purchased this piece last year. I am glad I did. The item wasn't easy to install, but that shouldn't let you not buy it. I hadn't considered it as a factor in my decision. I love using all the various options it has. I feel great after my cardio workout on this elliptical machine. It gives you a sense of feeling that you are climbing a mountain..starting out easy and then gets challenging. Fun!! I am happy with this purchase."
__label__2,"1-2-3- Magic for Teachers: Effective Classroom Discipline Pre-K through Grade 8: Book came in excellent condition and arrived in a speedy manner. I bought the book to help my son with his student teaching. He looks forward to using it next semester. We'll see if his classroom kids are behaving themselves better after he implements the ideas. My daughter uses the book for parents with her 5 year old. He seems to be responding quicker when he hears the ""That's one."""
__label__2,"Fascinating Reading: This book is written for lay people who want to deepen their knowledge of the New Testament and its history. This book presents a much needed perspective, by demonstrating the many instances in which New Testament passages have been altered, either due to error or an intentional effort to conform them to emerging church doctrines. Ultimately, the author demonstrates the fallacy in claiming that the New Testament is an unerring record of the words and beliefs of Jesus."
__label__1,"We don't like this walker very much...: Our daughter received this walker as a gift from her grandparents, without consulting us her parents, first. I would not have chosen this walker. Now 14 months old, she has never voluntarily pushed it around. The songs are annoying, loud (the 2-level volume switch doesn't make much difference) and often begin spontaneously if the walker is left on. The motor on the ABC wheel is sounds like it's grinding and the wheel comes out of place easily, whirring loudly, not spinning, until fixed."
__label__2,"Has worked well: Arrived with a major gash in the box which resulted in a slight dent on the flange that holds the canister. Other than that--no problems. It arrived on time, went together easily and has work flawlessly. Has made a major improvement in dust control. I highly recommend this piece of equipment."
__label__2,"Low budget, can-con Joy Luck Club: Sandra Oh (as Jade Li) is quite marvelous in this little 1994 Canadian movie. There's nothing overly original in it that we haven't seen in 1993's Joy Luck Club but then that's the movie biz, eh? Sit back and enjoy the performances and wonderful interactions between characters. The interaction between Jade Li and her younger sister Pearl Li (played by Frances You) are some of the better moments in this film. Frances You, as the young spunky kid sister, nearly steals every scenes from Oh, who has gone on to bigger and better things in Hollywood.Unlike the Joy Luck Club, this movie doesn't tie up the ending with a smarmy ending. There is no ending, really, as life has no ending, except in death."
__label__1,A good laugh!: This is one of the most hilarious books I have read in a long time. I cannot fathom teaching this to a child. Even more so I cannot believe an adult would want a child of theirs to be taught such outrageous nonsense. The only thing this book is good for is a good laugh.

__label__2,Great Book: It was interesting and scary. The author is definitely an insider. I was expecting something similar Criegton's work but this was better. I will definitely be extremely careful next time I visit a hospital. I see the credentials of the author and am wondering how much trouble he is in with his collegues since publishing this.
__label__1,"Not enough hulls, very uncomfortable, requested refund: A good buckwheat hull pillow should have about 4 pounds of hulls. This one only has 1 pound, which amounts to a flat pillow when spread out. You might as well put a blanket under your head. It may work well as a travel pillow! It also does not come with an additional pillow case. It only has the case that holds the hulls. The seller did offer a full refund, which was great because the pillow is not! I recently purchased a zippered pillow case (Kmart $2.99) and an additional 3 pounds of hulls from an ecom seller for $20 (shipped) and will make my own. You may want to as well."
__label__1,"Don't Bother: This machine is compact and cute and started out OK, although the milk frother was mediocre. It took a while to heat up in the morning, but after about 15 minutes and a half cup of water through the steam wand before it actually turned to steam, indicating that the machine was finally hot enough, I could make a cup of strong expresso when I used the double shot basket for a single cup. We maintained it, never let it run dry and decalcified it twice, but two and a half months after purchase the heater just stopped working. Fortunately we had purchased this at a Williams Sonoma Store, which has a very generous return policy and we just walked back in and got our money back. Don't waste your time and effort ordering this online from anyone; you will only be disappointed."

__label__1,"Ehh stay away from this product!: Racor actually makes some very good products for mounting bikes but this is not one of them. Very flimsy construction (the main pieces don't even bolt securely together!). It has to be leaned up next to a wall so I don't see how this is ""freestanding"" at all. It would not fit 2 full size mountain bikes. I called Racor and asked if they could send me some kind of extension piece and they refused and told me to return the product, so I did."

__label__1,"Awful. Simply worthless: Being an EMS provider for 11 years, I was eager for this movie to come out. Holy lord, was I disappointed. The plot was horrible, the acting was shamefully bad, and the audio for the dialogue sounded like everything was dubbed over. Terrible movie altogether."
__label__1,"Not at all factual- no fact checking: This book could have been good if it had checked the facts and some of the quotes.Spelling people's names wrong- all of it!I was shocked too that this Pennie Trumble person was so big headed. Cameron Crow HIMSELF in various interviews and in the extended DVD of Almost Famous has mentioned his influences BY NAME. Yes, Penny is one but so is Bebe Buell.They left out huge chunks of facts that could have really lent to the flow of the read.Sorry but this book shows bias and is not very good at all."
__label__2,"Another Great Book-To-Movie: One of my all-time favorites. Great locations, timeless story, excellent production values, and of course, a marvelous cast. No actor is mis-cast. The film never becomes maudlin or overly sentimental, though in another director's hand that might have happened. It simply tells the story the way Conrad told it.My DVD library won't be complete until this is added to it. When will it be released on DVD?"
__label__1,"Undistinguished: Washing performance is poor. Even on the ""Heavy"" cycle, wash time is only 14 to 15 minutes. On the other hand the final ""Spin"" cycle is overly long running 15 minutes. On my machine in the final ""Spin"" the machine made a loud banging noise and when the cycle finally ended, I noticed a large outward bump on the front right side of the machine. Apparently, the tub was banging against the front of the washer. Incidentally, Haier website states that this model has no agitator which in fact it does. The only redeeming quality that I can see, is the dual nylon bag type lint fitlers which do an outstanding job. Other than that, a total waste of money."
__label__2,"Powerful: One of the most powerful stories I have ever watched. I loved The Temptations growing up and realized there was a lot of inter-personal relationships and problems and this DVD explained a lot. What an amazing group of very talented men. I am on my way this evening to watch The Temptations in person at Turning Stone Casino in Verona, NY. I have third row seats and my husband will need to hold me back when they belt out ""Poppa Was A Rolling Stone""!"
__label__1,"Resident Evil fans need not apply: This movie was not at all like the game. They put a big twist on the first resident evil, by putting the members of s.t.a.r.s. under ground instead in the mansion where they belong. The movie added new members to s.t.a.r.s. that did not exist. The movie had a horrible storyline, of Jill Valentine waking up in the shower and dicovering that she was a member of s.t.a.r.s.. The original story was that Jill, Chris, Barry and Wesker were forced to stay in the mansion because there helicopter pilot abandoned them. The only thing from the game that the movie had right was the zombies. This movie only desreves 2 stars because first it was a bad movie and secondly it was not true to the original story. I hope that the sequel is true to Resident evil three."
__label__1,"Gross Exageration: As a combat veteran I spent several months in the 318th Reg. 80th Div. 3rd Army, including the Battle of the Bulge.

__label__2,"The Delphi Book to take on a Dessert Island: If I were going to be shipwrecked on a dessert island and could keep only one Delphi book, this is the one that I would choose. ""Delphi in a Nutshell"" contains easy to find information on all of the most important features of Object Paschal. The explanations are concise and to the point. Examples are helpful. This book has done more to increase my productivity than any other Delphi Book. It is perhaps not the best recommendation for those new to Delphi and the IDE, but all Delphi programmers will benefit from it. Kudos to Lischner."
__label__2,"Great Movie for AP Government: I teach AP Government and Politics and this gives the students an excellent picture of what campaigning is all about. Rergardless of a person's political affiliation, this movie shows the nitty gritty about the tediousness, repetition, grandstanding, and backstage operations of a political campaign. I highly recommend it."
__label__1,"Difficult to finish: I was very disappointed by The Lovely Bones. It was a difficult read right to the last page because the storyline just wasn't deep enough to be interesting. Where many readers couldn't put the book down, I had to force myself to stick with it. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and often found myself wondering why they were even part of the story. I assumed they'd play some key role later but alas, they did not - just sort of fell off the radar, only to be vaguely mentioned (if at all) in later chapters.If this is Ms Sebold's first novel, I have to give her credit. Writing isn't easy and getting published is even harder - especially a first novel. Just wish her editor had encouraged her to deepen this story a bit rather than allow it to just skim the surface of a plot that had so much potential."
__label__1,Failed after 1.5 years: I used this as my media drive to store my MP3s. After 1.5 years it has failed. I noticed a couple weeks ago that it became sluggish. So I backed up my data to another drive and low and behold today this one failed. Upon power up it would try to spin up but just make loud clicking noises instead. The light stayed on but the drive was unresponsive and not recognized by Vista.This will be the last WD product I purchase.
__label__2,for the price: I hadn't played in over 30 years and before that I only played for 2 years. As a beginner instrument it really isn't bad. Quality of construction is good and key action is alright. The finish is really quite good.
__label__1,"So much potential...: Keep in mind that this is not Charlie Parker and Tito Puente together, but tracks of them seperately thrown onto the same disc.The music on this CD is incredible, but the quality of the recordings are not. The music sounds out-of-phase (where the music ""cancels"" itself out), leaving the listener with a sound that has a tremendous hole in the middle. I listened to this disc on a few different CD players, and the result was the same. Imagine this...being in a room with Charlie Parker, et al, and being able to only hear 5% of the music clearly, the rest an ""airy"" buzz. Only a few minutes of this disc was tolerable.It sounds as if this ""project"" was thrown together in order to make a quick buck, without giving any regard to quality. Do not waste your money."
__label__1,"Not as advertised, not the best: As you have no doubt already read, this is *not* the premiere movie from 1993 but rather the 1998 TNT version. That irked me, and I hope that the distributors of this movie and ecom.com correct this mistake.This DVD literally contains an ad for Season 1 on DVD and the TNT version of ""The Gathering"". Nothing else. There's not even a menu on this DVD. This is as bare-bones as it gets, but then again, you are paying a few bucks for it so you get what you pay for.The only reason this merits two stars is literally the content. This is a editing of the movie that started it all for Babylon 5, laying the groundwork for a five year storyline. While it can seem a bit drab and drawn out, if you watch the show you will return to this movie and see things you never saw before.My recommendation is to getBabylon 5 - The Movie Collectioninstead. You will get a much better experience with the same movie as part of that set."

__label__1,"A waste....: This series began with alot of mystery and promise, but by book 5 it was evident that King had lost his way. I eagerly waited for this book - Song of Susannah was such a waste of time, but I waded through it anyway just so I could be ready for the final book.As I read through the book I began to have a feeling of trepidation. How many of you remember reading The Wolves of the Calla and realizing that, with only 20 or so pages left, the book was almost over and nothing had really been accomplished? Thats how I felt once Major Characters began dying in this book.And this book had a horrible finish.Do not read this book. Instead, write your own ending. How do you want Roland to come out of this adventure? The ending King gives is awful. How awful? It's like playing a video game and, when you beat it, a message comes up and says, ""Now try it again on a harder level.""Tripe. Hackneyed. Drivel. Pulp."
__label__1,"Just don't understand the hype: I first read this book about ten years ago, and while I thought it was an interesting story, failed to see the point in it. I reread it recently, thinking that now since I had become more ""enlightened"" maybe I had missed something. I liked it even less than previously. If you're looking for a book that ""changes lives"" skip this one."

__label__1,"Dead after less than a year: Great product when it worked. Used for around 9 months in a continuous mode. Sat next to my PC and functioned as my main HD. After 9 months, I found that it was dead one day. No warning, just one day it was dead. Probably will stick to the name brands for data storage from now on -- WD, Seagate, et al.After some poking around, I narrowed it down to a bad power supply (wall wart). Unfortunately, the supply is a 12V 3A, which is pretty monstrous. Still looking for free one, but the most I have on hand is 12V 2.5A, which isn't quite enough juice."

However, 480p is considered &quot;digital&quot; or &quot;enhanced,&quot; but definately not &quot;HDTV&quot; or &quot;High Definition.&quot; For that, the resolution would need to be 720progressive or 1080i. However, there are currently no DVD players that can properly display those images nor are there any DVDs to buy with those resolutions in them. What a crock and misleading. Target should strip this title immediately!"
__label__2,"Great for our aviary: We have three parrots in a 14X12 room. It's often very dusty and no matter how much we clean the cages, it smells like the seeds and kibble the birds eat.

__label__1,"Colorful but didn't last long: The balls are very colorful with all the country flags and are easy to use, but definitely NOT for a middle school of rambuncious students. We purchased several balls beginning of April. By May, they were deflated and torn. Need to be replaced again. I would repurchase for home use, but not for a school environment.Seller was great though. Very helpful."

I've found this works well with the ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" which you can buy here on ecom."
__label__1,"Not that great: I bought this andBody Back Company Scalp Massagerat the same time to see whether the motorized version was better, and if so how much. This motorized head massager has much sturdier prongs and a strong little motor, so much so that it wasn't relaxing. More irritating, and slightly painful. I couldn't make it comfortable.Thesimple version, on the other hand, was /great/. And only $4 at the time of this review. My advice? Save $16 and buy the simple version. Endless, cheap, source of relaxation for the price of a good mocha. If you really want to spend $20 on a head massager don't repeat my mistake. Buy 5 of theother oneinstead. You can keep two spares and still make two new friends out of the deal by giving the others away ;)"

I will do the dancey routine at some point, but was really looking for 3 30 minute routines, as described. If I had known it was one more dancey routine and one I owned, I wouldn't have purchased this.In addition, the Body Rock routine is lower quality video than on the Body Rock DVD, and doesn't have chapter divisions. I had to pop this one out and replace it with the Body Rock DVD to finish my workout.If you are interested in Jari Love, buy every earlier DVD, but skip this one."

__label__1,John was right...: Disapointment doesn't come close to describing this album. I should have known better than to take a chance and give it a listen. I saw all the positive reviews here on ecom and I thought that maybe it was possible that he'd achieved something the likes of which I haven't heard from him since the Beatles and early Wings. This album is PAINFUL to listen to. That he can't write himself out of a paper bag is nothing new. But the vocals are atrocious as well! After listening to this album I immediately replayed Let It Be just to remind myself that he used to be able to sing.

__label__1,"Good God, the agony!: Maybe I should have given it 1 star instead of 2, but I thought I'd be generous. The plot is not terrrrrrrible, but even before the ""twist"" at the end it's hard to swallow. And the twist - why do some authors think that making the most unlikely character the ultimate villain will make a book better? Is it just that they can't figure out how to end the things otherwise? (I guess the villain wasn't the MOST unlikely - it could have been the grandmother, but Patterson'll probably save that for a later book.)"
__label__1,"Cast Iron has it's limitations: While historically woks are made out of a form of cast iron. This is not the same cast iron material composition that you will find in the classic cast iron pans and dutch ovens. I have several cast iron items from Lodge which I am very pleased with. This is not one of them.I may not be an expert at cooking. But using this kind of cast iron wok seems to limit the capabilities of the wok concept. It takes a very long time to heat up and cool down. Once hot, it has a ferocious heat content which cooks well. But I think that's only one aspect of the Wok.Overall, I can't recommend that this is a good combination of materials and design. Cast Iron is great for a lot of other things in the kitchen, but perhaps the Chinese Wok of the more traditional design is the way to go."

__label__2,"Kirsten Excels as Butterfly!: Dorothy Kirsten was the ultimate Butterfly and she is perfect on this recording - ideal in voice and interpretation! Through her vocal magic, she transitions from the naive, young girl of act one to the noblest of heroines in the last act. Her lirico spinto is beautiful throughout and she moves effortlessly from delicate pianissimos one moment to soaring above the orchestral line in the next. It is easy to understand from this live recording how she was so acclaimed in this role. The remainder of the cast is strong and the recording is well recorded and, other than for the applause, could easily be taken for a studio recording!"

I has a good plot, good charactors, and a good pace. While similar to Eddings' other books, such as the Belgariad, it's different enough to keep you entertained. This was the first Eddings book I read and thought it was great, but after I read the Belgariad and Mallorean, I didn't think it was that great (hence the 3 by past standards).

With his sagely advice on tipping, as well as scoping out Elite Vacations magazine for his next yachting trip, Trump offers invaluable advice on succeeding in your pathetic, meaningless life.Of course, I assume he's writing a revised edition, since this one omits the chapter of 'thinking like a billionaire' that talks about writing a worthless, glorified supermarket checkout counter 'book', and collecting a few more dimes.Otherwise, the book has a shiny cover, and the paper stock appeared to be pretty standard.

I'm not sure that they're any more comfortable for him after the first five minutes, though, and if the poo is going to go up the back, this diaper won't contain it any more than any other disposable we've tried.

Turned out not to matter. The book does a good job of giving enough of an overview of the previous book that you understand completely what's happening, though I imagine reading them in the proper order would give you even more empathy for the characters. Of course, reading this book first spoils the ending of the other, but go figure. All in all, it's a good book and if you can't get your hands on Out Of Time, you'll still enjoy this one."
__label__1,"Don't buy this cheese on line: I once bought this cheese from a high-end cheese store in the San Francisco area and it was the best cheese I had ever eaten -- crumbly, fragrant of earth and (for some reason) oranges, a deep complex flavor that just kept on giving. I hunted for it in Los Angeles, couldn't find it, finally tracked it down on line at igourmet. What I got was like so-so parmesan: hard and a little oily with no particular flavor. To igourmet's credit, they apologized and gave me a full refund, so I don't blame then. I've since read that the cheese is fragile and very hard to find in its best state, even in Italy. If you love good cheese, put in the effort to find a cheese store that carries this cheese at its best. Unforgettable. But don't try to buy it on line."
__label__1,"3 strikes you're out Firefly: I bought the first, and was disappointed. Then I fell for Crusader. Better, but still fell short of expectations and just not fun enough to recommend. Now we get this garbage. Rather than fix the management of the game and the actual warfare, what we get is more BS to juggle. Goodluck if you choose the warfare campaign, you'll be too busy trying to deal with ever growing crime problems while the computer either a.) sits back and does nothing the entire game or b.) attacks you with hundreds of troops 5 minutes into the game. At no point in the week of playing this have I been able to build a attack worthy army, nor even a decent castle. Not to mention that most of the maps, the terrain is so cluttered and setup that castle building is essentially impossible. Not that it matters because you pretty much don't have time to collect sufficient stone to build one anyway. If you are looking for a game of castle defending and sieging, look elsewhere.Other cons: slow and buggy"
__label__2,"An amazing book on parenting and the touching humans need!: If you only get one book on parenting and how to raise a child get this one. This is a thick book with lots of research to support the ideas presented by Dr. Montague. However scholastic this book might be it is very readable. If you find the title misleading some chapter headings are breastfeeding, tender loving care, the physiological effects of touching, skin and sex and growth and development. The skin and sex chapter discusses how touching our children affects their sexuality. This is one amazing book full of data that instructs us to hold our children close as long as possible and why this is so critical to their development in every aspect. Read it!!!"
__label__2,"Service Counts.: Here's the thing ... this is not going to be as nice as your original Sony AC adapter. Once you get it in the mail (which will happen quickly, btw) you'll understand why it's so cheap. But it works! Which is really all you need, right? Plus, the huge bonus is that SmartParts USA is a great seller. Like one of the above respondents, the black insulation on one of the cords broke within about two weeks after receiving the item. I was extra careful with it b/c this is why I had to get a replacement in the first place (but the Sony one lasted 2.5 years). So, when I looked down and saw the busted cord I was super frustrated. I sent an email to SmartParts, they apologized, and I received a replace cord right away. Holy cow! They dealt with it exactly like they should have. Of course, I am pretty worried about this happening again, but for now I am happy and it's all b/c of customer service."
__label__1,"Disappointing: We have owned this product for about two years and already had to purchase new (expensive) batteries for the handsets because they would no longer take a charge. Now the new batteries no longer hold enough charge for the speakerphone to function - if you press the speakerphone button, the battery life immediately goes to zero and the phone dies (and you lose the call). From the beginning, these phones would die if you left them off the charger overnight.The design is very slick and appealing, but we found that the features were clumsy and disappointing. You can't convert a caller ID number to a phone book entry because it doesn't include the ""1"". Phonebook entries on the two handsets are independent and can't be transferred. There is no headset jack.Overall I would not recommend this phone. We bought it at a discount at BJ's, and for our replacement set I'm paying more attention to customer reviews and will probably go with the Panasonic KX-TG9344T."

Everyone we've come to love and love to hate are either dead or mysteriously absent from this volume. The storyline is shattered, new characters and houses and sers are introduced every chapter and I have absolutely no idea who they are and don't even care. What a mess and disappointment. Forget it if you want to know what's happening with Tyrion, Jon, Bran and Daenerys, they don't even show up in this book. The entire book seems like one long Cersei whine-fest. I tried but I'm bailing at page 531 and will just wait for the next book to find out what happens to the characters we really care about."

A gentleman by the name of Scott gave me a tour of the show room and I have to say that I was very impressed with the Aluminum NAVIGATOR case and all the bells and whistles. Scott dimmed the lights in the display room and the NAVIGATOR looked like it was coming in for a landing at LAX! I had planned to buy the black front but found myself really impressed with how the RED coordinated with the lighting and the black case. Scott informed me not to worry about the color because the price on the aluminum case included (2) additional colored scheme panels so I could change colors whenever I liked! I selected RED with my order and received black and silver as well. The aluminum case also comes with a 500 watt supply and additional cooling. All this was well worth the cost between the steel and aluminum cases. Overall I was extremely impressed."

This book provides a very fascinating and informative account of how masturbation has been vilified and denigrated over the ages, and can, will and should go very far in helping people overcome inhibitions and culturally negative and unhelpful attitudes. Masturbation can be very constructive and helpful towards teaching and helping people have orgasms in sexual relationships. Masturbation should not be an either/or, related to intercourse or interpersonal sex. It should be thought of as a person can eat alone, or eat with others."

Unfortunately, much like others who have reviewed the book, I found out the hard way that buying this book was certainly not the route to take. It is simply a step-by-step guide to making a silly flash project that doesn't even utilize Flash's more interesting tools. On top of this, it has glaring omissions and vague wording that make following the steps extremely frustrating and difficult. I would suggest to those just getting into Flash MX, trying ""Flash MX 2004 Demystified"" by Bucknell, Hogg, and Swann and by all means AVOID this book."

__label__1,"Shocked!: Except for the name Caran d'Ache, this hardly qualifies as a fine writing instrument and is more in the category of pens of BIC quality. In fact, it is simply a cheaply made plastic pen that happens to have been produced in Switzerland. To complete the outrage, it arrived in a tawdry vinyl coin purse-like case that was an insult. For $70.00 plus shipping, one expects to be rather pleased with the purchase when it is a Caran d'Ache. But this, this is beyond comprehension. I have used pens chained to the counters at banks that were more impressive. At least those pens are more substantial and more smoothly finished. Caran d'Ache should be ashamed of this crummy piece of trash! No self respecting collector of fine writing instruments would display this. The humiliation would be just too much to bear."

__label__1,"dismal: In an effort to promote his politically correct beliefs, Carroll twists, avoids, and discards the facts about Constantine and the Early Church neglecting for example, to include the many acts of significant anti Christian violence perpetrated by Jews against the fledgling Christian communities.This is a bland and faulty personally biased trip into the past relying on contemporary sources suporting his own thesis but not delving into the archives. This book should not be taken as anything approaching objectivity and as such deserves neither merit nor attention."
__label__2,"A GREAT BOOK BY SO FROM NORTH BOULVARD: The book I am reviewing is ""The Magicians Nephew "". It is written by C.S. Lewis. I think this book deserves 5 stars because it is surprising, adventures, and if you saw the movie it answers a lot of unknown questions like where the wardrobe, witch, Narnia, lamppost and the wardrobe came from. This book is fiction. It is about a boy and a girl who find a secret passage. It leads to a house. Someone lives there. But who? Read this book and you will fall in love with it. One of the problems that occurs is the girl is stuck in a whole different world. Also the witch is chasing them. I would recommend this book to anyone. This author has written a series of extraordinary series of books."

I thought it would have some interviews... some fun as ""The Cure Play Out"" (VHS)has...Third - They said ""THE DVD ALSO CONTAINS A FEW 'HIDDEN EXTRAS'""that I couldn't find...Fourth - If you pay attention in the end of ""A Forest"", they just took the VHS video, cut, and put inside of the DVD....(You can hear a applause noise)...:(Fifth - The accustic session is really strange!!!

__label__1,"Godly ignorance: This author claims that Jesus Christ is nothing but a myth; a personality formed by the meshing together of other pagan gods. Therefore, she has no idea who God is and no idea of Jesus Christ's love for not only her, but the whole world. Don't believe the Bible? The only way to disprove the Bible is to believe in what it says and for none of its promises to come to pass. Try that, then write a book on how the Bible isn't true."
__label__1,"If you don't believe in your own experiences, this is the book for you.: This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It deserves 0 stars. It is completely choppy and annoying. The author would serve the public better by just setting up his website as a gigantic book review. Clearly the author has a point of view but seems incapable of articulating it in his own words. What makes the book so tedious is the constant stream of quotes from others. There is no cohesive body of thought or experience in this book. You are just jostled from one quotation to another. If you need to prop up your ego with what other ""thinkers"" say in order to defend your reality system, then this is the book for you."

__label__1,"Bought it yesterday, returning it tomorrow: I bought this from a local bike shop. I'm thankful so that I can return it more easily. As I was assembling it I noticed that one velcro strap that was supposed to be sewed on was not. No big deal, an easy fix.However, once I had it assembled I went to attach it to my bike. The clamp looked like it was falling apart on the first attachment, and once I climbed aboard my foot hit the clamp on every stroke unless I pedaled with the middle of my foot. I figured it may have just been my Mountain Bike, but it did the same thing on my Road Bike.For reference, I wear size 12 shoes, above average but not unusual.My wife enjoyed it on her bike (end of the driveway and back) but we didn't pay $220 for something that only one of us can enjoy.

I have not been refunded the cost of the item nor the shipping. Fussing about $18 + the shipping cost seems a bit dramatic, however I might as well have burned my money.

One chapter was dedicated to ""Diplomatic with committee members"". It might be true for the author's case. Also, it might applicable for many cases. But what? One dedicated chapter for diplomatic? You're kidding me, right? I can't imagine what happen if every one follows this guideline and spend their time for diplomatic playing, instead of researching. Myth and fact are not the case either. Myth is not myth and fact isn't true. Please don't wait your time on this book. ""Tomorrow's professor"" or ""Get what you came for"" are much much better."

I'm not one to usually get stuck on points like cinematography and stuff but it was so distracting. At one point I think they actually reversed the coloring in the background to look like a negative! And then to have Richard Moll (Bull, from Night Court) show up out of nowhere as a lawman was just so weird. I don't think I'll be watching this one again and I bought all 8 of the 2007 horrorfest titles. Of the 5 I've watched so far, this is the worst."
__label__1,"Where Was the Microphone?: While most collectors will admit that live recordings have sonic drawbacks and require more highly tuned listening than studio recordings, here we have a case where it is almost impossible to appreciate what must have been a very fine performance of Puccini's rarely performed opera. The orchestra comes through clearly with a lack of bass which makes the sound too brash. The singers, however, sound like they were in a different theater. The greatest shame is that the role of Magda is sung by the lovely Jeannette Pilou, a grossly underrecorded artist. If there was no remastering that could be done with the original recording (and Opera d'Oro has done some marvelous remasterings!)they should have waited until a better recording could have been acquired which would show this gem of an opera in its proper light."

Realized after shooting a number of shots on vacation that the glare is a huge issue. Ruined a number of shots.These are fine if you want something to protect your lens while in a bag but after stepping up to a more expensive filter the difference was immediately apparent.The only way to give this product a good review is if you aren't ever shooting in an instance where there will be light.

Where the tone and style is so totally off that you're willing to throw the book down even if you just plunked 10+ dollars for it?Sorry, but that was this book for me.

__label__1,"ridiculous print ink capacity and continuously misfeeds: This is the worst printer I have ever owned and I have owned more than 20 over the years. I bought this one because the sales rep told me it was high volume and very fast. I was led to believe that the ink cartridges would last at least twice as long as the cheaper models and since I do a lot of printing, this was important to me. Well, it uses ink up twice as fast as my other printers and it CONTINUOUSLY misfeeds. This is very annoying as it will pull multiple pages through the print tray. It wouldn't be so bad if it pulled them equally and you could just refeed, but no, it pulls them so that a page actually prints out over several! Absolutely a wast of money and avoid this printer at all costs."
__label__1,"Why?: I am not sure why anyone, except my mom, would purchase this cd. I listened to the whole thing with my dad when it first came in the mail after my mom ordered it and we couldn't determine when on song ended and the next one began. Eventually we just figured its an album of one track. The guy thinks he's the man, but he's just a dave matthews wanna-be without a band. He should find a band and think up some new songs. IF you're a girl you'll probably like it. buy OAR or Dispatch, but stay away if you're looking for music."
__label__1,"HORRIBLE Espresso!: I had high hopes for this only to be VERY let down. I've had the Lavazza ""Super Crema"" (blue bag) and it was pretty good. This ""Crema e Aroma"" is some of the worst espresso beans I've tasted. The cream is decent but the flavor is thin and sour. I've tried different grinds, water temps, tamps, etc... nothing helps. I have been making espresso at home for 10 years using high-end consumer equipment so I know how to make good espresso... these beans are very lightly roasted, versus most beans I've used, and very dry out of the bag. Maybe the trip from Italy kills the beans? Either way, if you like good espresso... better than Starbucks quality, stay away from Lavazza Crema e Aroma."
__label__2,No more pain!: Got one of these for my wife and me (men's version) because every time we went for a ride after about a half hour it was majorly uncomfortable...We've been riding on these saddles for 2 weeks now and keep noting how it's so much more fun to ride without the 'back pain'!This did the trick for us!
__label__2,wow: wow. i love the undertones of this film. it's the subtleties that make it great. i wasn't too big a fan of the typical cliche romantic courtship...but it did hit a few notes i'm sure we can all relate to. it's one of those comedies that isn't really laugh out loud funny...but the story and message is great. i definitely recommend.
__label__2,Ferrari Fan: Powerful advice for all those who have been given the charge to manage and lead people. A wonderful book!
__label__2,"You gotta read it: I discovered the Urantia Book in 1971 and fortunately had the time to read and study it then because it takes a bit of effort to get acquainted with the concepts and word symbols used to convey meaning. But, for me, this book describes the workings of God's Universe of universes--from the most spiritual to the most physical--in ways no other single source can. To evaluate it or to allow it to affect your life, you gotta read it."
__label__1,Not what I wanted: I was looking for The Goblins that were on the old Dawn of the Dead movie...not punk and now that I've actually heard them I'd say they are way outdated in terms of vocals and the fact that it sounds like The Powerchords instead of The Goblins.
__label__2,"Hoffman's Best Effort!: I have been an avid follower of Alice Hoffman for more than a decade. ""At Risk"" remains my favorite of her books. I loved most of the characters (that insensitive fool Betsy, the mother of her son's friend was for the birds). I loved the way AIDS was treated in a gentle, sensitive way without stigma being attached to the illness. I loved the way Charlie and his weirdly named friend Sevrin (why would anybody name their child Sevrin? that is cruel) were friends in spite of the stupidity of Sevrin's mother, Betsy. I actually cheered when Polly, the mother of Amanda and Charlie stood up to that fool Betsy and called her on her prejudice. I love the way she tried to hit that fool with logic concerning her daughter Amanda's illness. For everyone who has ever cared about somebody who was termainally ill, for everyone who cares about people in general (that's where Betsy gets off the train), this book is for us. A KEEPER!"

__label__1,"Do Not Order Via Kindle: The Kindle version of this is awful!!!! The first 25% of the books the text ranges in all types of sizes from very small font too huge font all on the same page. I tried to see if there was a way to fix this and tried to resize the type, did not work. I then downloaded thinking maybe it was the copy in the cloud, did not work. So I am going to return it and then order a hard copy.Very, very disappointed in this and lack of a way to ask ecom for help."
__label__1,"The Necronomican is a work of fiction: People are SO gullable, how many morons carry around this book while listening to Marilyn Manson on their ipods thinking that they are exploring the ""dark arts""? Lovecraft invented the Necronomican to tie his stories together into what has become known as the Cthulu mythos. I can't fault the author for trying to make a buck but anyone who thinks this is anything but fiction should contact me about a bridge I'm selling in Brooklyn."
__label__2,"AMAZING SHOES!: Good Morning! I bought these for my Birthday Weekend, and dancing with my friends. They worked wonderfully! They're ONLY a 4 inch heel, (surprising from Jessica Simpson), but they didn't hurt 5 hours into wearing them. I LOVE these HEELS!"
__label__1,"Extremely Disappointing: This 64-page book is very shallow and provides no in-depth analysis. The author relies heavily on the works of Les Grau and the writing he had done on the Soviet-Afghan War. There is very little discussion of the current conflict and the use of caves by the Taliban or Al Qaeda. More than half of the book contains current pictures from the U.S. Army, DoD and other sources, but the pictures are rarely tied to the current topic the author was discussing.The author appears to be attempting to cash in on current world events and use this book as a platform to speak out against the current administrations policies.I would not recommend this book to anyone for any purpose."
__label__2,"Features the appearance of The Inspector: Community is one of the best, well-thought-out series for many years. Hopefully for a few more years to come.In a glorious homage (not ""spoof,"" per se) of Doctor Who, ""Inspector Spacetime"" captures the attention of not only the characters and fans of Community, but also people who have never seen the series, drawn to this new take on a science fiction icon and legend.The Inspector has rightfully grown his own fanbase (many of whom are mutual Community fans), and with their help via Kickstarter, has produced a web series to fuel our desire to continue following his adventures in Space & Time.It's not about ""if"" you'll buy this season of Communtiy, and begin your enjoyment of The Inspector's travels, but ""when"" you will buy it.You can also watch The Inspector's ongoing web series at11thinspector(dot)wix(dot)com/theinspector"
__label__2,"Body Movin': When you hear the term rap-rock these days, you probably think of artists like Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. But the label applies just as well to 2 Skinnee J's. The J's mix Beastie Boys-style old-school rap with guitar riffs and a healthy dose of humor. Clear some dance space in your bedroom and shout along to the hilarious ""Stockholm Love.""Best Song: ""3 Minutes"""
__label__1,"Why The Green Tint?: The extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring on Blu-ray has a green color shift across the entire movie. I believe the studio made an error in mastering this movie. The snow looks teal/green, even the lettering of the title no longer looks as white. This isn't the Matrix and the colors were great to begin with, so why mess it all up? I loaded screenshots into photoshop just to verify the colors had been changed, and sure enough the snow scenes are reading much higher in the green channel as opposed to previous releases of the movie. The other two movies don't suffer from this ""green shift"" so I urge others to complain, not buy, return their copies until WB issues a trade-in for a properly mastered disk!"
__label__2,"Good drill kit: This is a nice assortment of drills for general use. Like the extra drills in the smaller sizes because they are the first to break. Case is a nice shape and fits well in a tool bag. Drills are sharp and cut very easily. Overall, a very nice set."
__label__2,"A Wonderful book for the Diana Collector: This is a wonderful picture book for the collector of Princess Diana memorabilia. The tribute from author William Holden was touching, with various tidbits regarding his relationship with the Princess. There was a nice mixing of color photos from her private and also her public life. The pictures in this book seem to bring out the laughter and charming spirit that was the Princess Diana."
__label__1,"The show and music are wonderful, but...: The show and music are wonderful, but this doesn't capture the show. If I am just going to listen to the music, I prefer the ""Complete Symphonic"" CD. If I want to watch the play (and I have seen it about 8 times in various places) I want to watch the play and this does not deliver.Now don't get me wrong, this is good for what it is, but it is not the play. It also cuts out some of the most relevant scenes in the play in my. It is merely some of the best (or at least most famous) performers signing their parts. If you want to have another version of the play this is fine, but if you want to get a flavor of the show, but the CD (above) and wait until they release a real version on DVD (if ever)."
__label__2,"More tasty adventure from those Rheostatics: It's hard to imagine someone discovering this review who doesn't already love the Rheostatics - why else would you know about them? -- but if you have any concerns about ""Harmelodia"", don't worry. It's a sweet and strange children's story, sure, but it's also a solid and rich sonic adventure as only they seem to be doing in this decade. If ""Progressive Rock"" records from old have worn out their thrill on your shelves, and you'd like all that musical and lyrical creativity with a little more honest emotion and fun holding it together, then come and get it!"

__label__1,"Nice pictures shame about basic recipe: I actually like the pictures in this book and find it a nice book to read but I have found, as other people have, that the basic cupcake recipe for Chocolate Sour Cream Cupcakes does NOT work. I have tried it three times and (once totally ignoring the book method and using a method from another tried and tested book) found that each time the cupcakes sink and form huge craters that leave the cakes unedible. I am an avid cookbook collector and cook and have never found this problem before. Such a shame as the book looks so nice."
__label__2,"Informative, though promotional: Three years after it was published, this is still the only book that I'm aware of that offers comprehensive coverage on the subject. Luckily, it is a very informative one -though a bit promotional. If you are looking to build or have someone build an SIP home, read this book first then you'll know at least as much as your SIP sales person does -a good position to be in when shopping for anything."
__label__1,"Too light weight: The four pound weight is too light. When the weight is lowered below 20 feet and you troll at 2 knots, the weight does not go straight down but at a 20 to 30 degree angle. You will not know how deep you really are. I am replacing it with an 8 pound weight."
__label__1,"Inferior design: I originally purchased this product, but was so disappointed in its user interface (i.e. it was a pain in the butt to program and setup) that I sent it back.Based upon some of the 500+ comments, I bought the Reecom R-1650 Weather Alert Radio, and 100% recommend it over the Midland. The Reecom is well worth the extra money."
__label__2,"Casio class pad: This product is really good if you are studying a pretertiary maths in tasmania, and otherwise, it simply lets you perform so many useful calculations that can be a pain to do by hand!"
__label__2,Krupss Grill and Panini Maker: This is a wonderful grill and maker of panini.....It works wonderfully well. Is easy to use andand clean. An appliance anyone would like!! The instuctions are well laid out.Received in a timely manner and would buy again.
__label__1,A beautiful book with a horrible message: Rainbow Fish is not very nice. But I also don't think highly of that little fish that thinks it is ok to ask him for a scale.The message seems to be that Rainbow Fish needs to give away what makes him special so that he can make friends. Buy your friends???Surely Rainbow Fish (and the other fish) could have learned a better lesson on friendship. This book really misses the mark.I will not read this book to my son. What a shame too because it is so pretty.(updated after reading some of the other reviews) I do get what the other reviewers are saying about the general lesson of sharing and vanity but when I read it the other message hits me so hard that I just can't get past it. I just don't like the story.
__label__1,"Very poor quality: My 22month old daughter got this board as a gift. We liked the idea, that it has a string attached, so you could hang it up on the wall, BUT......the wooden-frame fell apart on the first day we had it. We try to put it back together, but as soon as you take it in your hands, it falls apart again.What a waste of money.And besides this crappy toy, we purchased a Melissa and Dough Plush-Doggie, which was moldy smelling. We are done with Melissa and Doug."
__label__1,"Are you sure its not Ku-rupt: In short, this machine made great tasting espresso, and marginal coffee. This gift from my parents gave me higher hopes of a slighlty more refined level of coffee connoisseur-ship, but was dissappointed after the device failed within 2 months. Frankly the device is cheap and belongs on a WalMart shelf for $20."
__label__1,"Aruba: Terrible plot, performance, story etc etc Poor chemistry with Rock and his partner and this story could have done better with more work."
__label__2,Good Very Very Good: I read Father Elijah years ago and have given it to fmily now to have the whole story was truly wonderful.A thoughtful well written story of Warsaw during the WWII and a man who thought he was nothing finding out that he wasa gift from God to a young Jewish boy. One never knows who they might be saving out of a simple act of kindness.
__label__2,Walker: There is nothing any better than watching Walker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just wish there were more than eight seasons. I would own them all.
__label__2,"Gives Peace of Mind: This is very handy to have. So far my newborn son has only had to use the electrolytes, but it is reassuring to know that everything is pre-approved. I was also pleased to see that the expiration dates on the packages are a few years out."
__label__2,"So much better than ""The Rules""!: this techniques outlined in this book are an excellent way to find a good man and still be yourself! you learn how to talk to a guy in a way he can understand and relate to, then you can talk to him about anything! in ""The Rules"" they basically say you can't talk to him at all, and that's wrong. if you follow the techniques in this book you are on your way to finding someone who you can be yourself with and have a good relationship."
__label__1,The cover is horrible / cheap: The cover is extremely thin/cheap and tears very easy. The 10 inch wedge does not have a decently priced cover replacement and covers this size are not common.I do not recommend this product. for $10 more you can get a better quality wedge from somewhere else.
__label__1,"So not worth the price: I bought this all clad crock pot because I love all clad's cookware. I loved that I could program the start of the cooking and the total cook time. What i did not expect was for it to just stop working after about 20 uses. It was dead as a doornail with $15 worth of organic chicken in it that I had to throw out. Everything lit up, it just never got warm enough to actually cook anything. Incredibly disappointing!"
__label__1,"Product Didnt Work!: The day that i got this in the mail, my daughter and i pulled it out so that she could start using it. While the buttons and the process of listening to the CD's was easy, the player did nothing but skip and skip and scratched up her CD. I was so mad that i went online to find out how to return it... (company review wasnt great)"
__label__2,"The Search: ""The Search"" by Grace Livingston Hill is the first book that I have read that I did not thoroughly enjoy. (And I have read probably 36 of her books) The struggle that Ruth MacDoanld and John Cameron had to be together and find happiness was not compelling, and not up to the standard of Mrs. Hill's other wonderful books. This was a book I found easy to put down."
__label__2,Western Movies that Are Enjoyable: I wasn't sure how the producers would portray Whispering Smith from the movie version starring Alan Ladd. They changed his character from a railroad dectective to a colorado police officer. Following Alan Ladd in the role of Whispering Smith the movie to Whispering Smith the TV series was an acting triumph for Audie Murphy.Audie Murphy was a great pick for a TV version series of Whispering Smith. I wached all the episodes in one week. I liked the fact that true to life detective techniques were used and that added narration by Audie Murphy throught out the episode was used to keep the viewer focused on the story. It was much like waching a 1940s detective story with the detective narrating the story. I have always liked Audie Murhy as a Western actor. He plays his roles very well.
__label__2,We enjoyed this book!: The book of Pioneer women was bought for a gift for a 90 year old women and the pictures were large enough for her to see. We enjoyed reading it too. Thanks.
__label__2,"all REPRINTS ....argh!: Why do they do this? Why can't they be bothered to buy new work from these writers? I want new stories. New material.:::quiet sobbing::::I was so eager for my Christmas candy, I didn't pay close enough attention. I should have known that Emma Jensen hadn't broken her silence.Waaaaaaahhhhh It's worse than opening a Christmas present and finding out that it's the same one you gave to that person last year. Okay, maybe not that tacky but pretty damned close.I only gave it four stars because I don't blame the authors and I think they're the ones that are more affected by stars.

__label__2,"A German Tale: From feigling to bravour: From feigling (coward) to bravour (bravery): A German Tale, where a little girl's memories of flowers, balloons, milk and cookies, childhood adventures, long walks, family vacations, and kisses from a sweetheart take on different meanings. A German Tale, where snails, kitty cats, bunnies, and little bugs bring a feast of delight for the eye of the beholder. A German Tale, a story of truth - and the shame of a country. Life during war as told through the eyes of a little girl, Erika delivers to the world a healing book for the soul of anyone who reads it."
__label__2,"A book that you were meant to read: If you read Seven Storey Mountain, you were probably meant to read it. One of the customer/reviewers said ""I doubt that any of us would have heard of him or his writings if he hadn't become a monk. As a lay writer, he would have been forgotten long ago."" That's true, I'm sure. But thanks to the Holy Spirit, Thomas Merton became a Trappist Monk, wrote this and other spiritual works and now many are brought to God through his writings. The book doesn't have to be ""great literature"" to get across a good message. I don't think Merton was setting out to write a literary masterpiece and the book should not be judged as such. It should be judged as the story of a man's life. As for Merton's spiritual dabblings... why does the scope of his journey make his journey any less valid? We are all searching - should we search on only one road? If you don't want to read this book, fine. If you do want to read this book it's because you are meant to."
__label__1,"Overly long, dull, and overrated: It's overly long, dull, depressing, and ultimately, nothing much happens. The story could have been told in less than an hour. I realize it's got great reviews (highly overrated, imo), but I wasn't impressed. :-\Don't get me wrong - the acting was superb and the concept is sobering and touching. But it's just too blah and long overall ... to the point that by the end I was glad the darn thing was over and more than a little annoyed that it took so long to get there!What a waste of nearly two hours."
__label__1,"Okay, but not amazing.: This CD is just okay. There's not really anything that amazing about it. The thing that was so amazing about their debut was that it had never been heard before, but this CD is just more of the same. Not that it's not worth listening to, but it's just that this CD is nothing new and amazing. I was an LP fan back when they were Hybrid Theory, and I met them all in Denver with the Kottonmouth Kings before Hybrid Theory ever came out. They're all great guys and they're very talented. But don't be fooled by other reviews saying this CD is amaing. You've heard it all before, but it is still worth listening to."
__label__2,"Bought for my 10 year old son: I bought this as a project to share with my 10 year old son. We put it together in less than half an hour (other than some time to let the glue dry). He had a blast, learned a lot, and was thrilled with the whole process. The kit was very easy to assemble."
__label__2,"I want to take Draven home with me!: Just so you know the person who said this book read like a teenager, would you let your teenager read this book? I don't think so. I loved this book every step of the way! I recommend it if you like historical romances, and if you like Sherrilyn Kenyon/Kinley MacGregor! :)"
__label__1,"Awful, blanched, tasteless and hard.: I can't believe they actually sent this to me labeled as food...I am presently researching a means of returning this product."
__label__1,"George had a good idea but the book really stunk.: At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that ""Brave New World"" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."
__label__2,"good for beginers: This is my first time trying pilates. I was impresed that it wasen't too dificult yet still challenging.Some of the yoga poses are rather advanced to be on a beginers video, but you can just sit in childs pose during the harder ones. I have felt a notisable difference in my posture and feeling of well-being every time I do it. Denise Austin is a little perky, but not too bad. This video is definetly worth a try for people new to pilates, although, it helps to know a little yoga."
__label__2,Quite Pleased!: I purchased this item for my son. I had to send the first one back due to a defect. Once he received this one my son really loves it! The replacement was received within three days of emailing ecom of the problem.
__label__1,"Very disappointed: I heard good things about this author, enjoy supernatural thrillers, and the storyline seemed interesting. Unfortunately the back of the book was better than the contents themselves. I plodded through the first quarter of the book and had to put it away. The characters weren't engaging and the dialogue dry and dull. I waited and waited for the pace to pick up, for something to happen to make me care about what happened to the characters. No dice.I tried to pick it back up not too long ago, thinking maybe I just hadn't read far enough to get to the good parts. Well, I plodded along until I was about two-thirds of the way through before I gave up entirely. The idea was interesting, but in my opinion the author was sleepwriting when she wrote this. Not worth the cost, even in a discount store."
__label__2,"Great ginger brew!: Great ginger ale with a little ginger bite to it. The flavors of the honey and lime come through nicely, and the flavors are very clean. Highly recommended if you're a fan of ginger ale."

In the last year I have incorporated Vic Firth Extreme Sticks into my set up. X5B with Vic Grip and I have used X5A. I just felt this was the perfect addition and have no complaints"
__label__1,"Misleading Page: I just got a remanufactured cartridge instead of a new, HP-made one. See comments from others. My complaint is that ecom allows at least this seller to post a misleading product description. The weasel word which they use to cover their tracks is ""replacement."" This hardly connotes ""remanufactured.""ecom needs to police its 30-rd party sellers far more vigorously. I don't blame the 3rd party, I blame ecom."

Misskelley confessed and told the story of what they did.. NOBODY makes up a story like that. Specific. Just a joke that anyone would want to free these animals. Garbage
__label__2,"Perfect!!!: I had this LP back in the day, like when it first came out. I listened to it all the time. This remastered CD sounds perfect to me. Everything is crystal clear. I would suggest this anyone that wants to replace their LP collection with CD's."

The book helped me to be more conscious of my weaknesses and my strengths. There are 4 temperaments and there are 12 combinations of temperaments. I am a Melancholy/Choleric. Melancholies for example are never satisfied and can overcome this weakness with a life of heartfelt thanksgiving. The strength of Megan Melancholy is her incredible self discipline. In response to this new information, I have been able to exercise self-discipline to be more thankful and grateful. I write 5 things daily for the things I am thankful for. My life has been changing and improving ever since. This is honestly a powerful book."

The only way I'll get this and Volume One is they go on sale for half price. Especially since it will probably mean leaving Krystle and Alexis burning in that cabin for a few years!"
__label__2,"A True Gem: This book is very readable and always deep. It requires that the reader have a basic understanding of Bion in order to mine the riches that the author has unearthed here.Each chapter is a fresh look at aspects of the prenatal in our daily speech and act. This may seem farfetched, but the author's discussion of mental pressure, the sense of strangeness and human speech are nicely linked up to prenatal experiences.This book is wonderful."

It's a great local Thai noodle restaurant and serves her famous excellent Thai Chicken.Upon eating there twice, I decide to buy her 2 books. I absolutely love her book. Her dishes optimizes the combination of sweet, salt, sour, spicy that you REALLY can't figure out the breakdown of elements of spices when you eat the food.After making rounds at the local Asian grocery store to buy all the ingredients one afternoon (couldn't find green peppercorns or Thai white peppercorns), I adventured making her Crying Tiger dish, a Bangkok Chicken dish that they don't serve here in US. It was awesome!! My mouth still salivates when I think of this dish. It's so good that I made it again the next day for dinner.Can't wait to discover some of her other recipes.

__label__2,"best option for stereo for LG Chocolate: The LG Chocolate requires 2.5mm plug for wired headphones and these fit the bill -- in stereo which is what you need for the Chocolate (most 2.5 mm things are mono). Note you will still need the adapter that comes with the phone in order to use these headphones -- they don't plug directly into the phone. The packaging makes we wonder if these are really official Jabra equipment (there was a white sticker that said something about a ""special"" product version). Maybe it was something that Jabra decided wasn't going to be up to their standards. However they do match the features of the model number they indicate. This is going to be the best deal you're going to find on a stereo in-ear style headphones with bonus (fairly usable) hands-free functionality."
__label__2,2 y/o Rock Star: This guitar is a toy and not a real guitar. It is the perfect size for my 2 y/o rock star. The sounds effects can be annoying and tape over the speaker helps keep it lower. You can take the batteries out so it just strums like a guitar without all the sound effects. This is a good TOY guitar and I recommend it for a young age group. My 2 y/o loves this. He walks around with it all day long.
__label__1,"Unintentionally hilarious: Two words summarise this book: Abject nonsense. With the marked exception of the chapter on Vietnam, which is suprising insightful and sensitive. Which makes the ludicrous ramblings of the other chapters all the more baffling!"
__label__2,"Amazing!: This book is wonderful. I do not know that much about the internet, and this book (and the web site) have made me smarter about the internet."
__label__1,"sorry I wasted my time: I work over the phone, and need both hands free. A headset that is comfortable which I can hear over is necessary. This one doesn't fit my head right. Granted, my head it a little bit large, I wear a Large size hat. The headband kept trying to slip up and off my head. I did like the length of the mouthpiece. I could not hear well enough to use this. The people I talked to sounded like they were at the bottom of a well, and I had to push the ear piece against my ear to hear at all.I wouldn't recommend this at all."

__label__2,"An Awsome book that you must read!: Francie is a girl who is dirt poor, and living in Brooklyn during harsh times. Francie is strong through the horrible things that happen to her during the course of her life. I cried, I laughed, and I felt the pain that Francie felt. Francie also deals with the tradgedy of her fathers death. Not to mention almost being raped. This book also deals with a girl becoming a woman. A must read book!!!!!"
__label__1,"this isn't good at all.: This game isn't very good. first, You have to go through lots of very difficult levels, The people spend forever talking, and you have to find some artifact to restore the world. you have to use psychic and magical powers lIke earth, wind, sun, and fire(which i don't like). so iwouldn't recommend this game to impatient gamers."
__label__1,Terrible penetration after they changed the tips: I had some of the old style Arrow T50 Staples (same model number) which have diagonal cut points on the tips. Those work great for numerous applications. I had to get some more and guess what they changed the style of penetration tips to something that does NOT work. These will not go through heavy cloth or mesh. Avoid!Arrow should have had the decency to change the model numbers on their T50 lines to indicate that they were gimping them down to be less effective (and force one to use more staples?).
__label__2,"The CD Cover: This is not a review of the CD, since I dont even have it, but while I was looking at the reviews I saw the CD cover, and is it me or are they doing a shout-out to The Kinks, because if you compare the covers its the same exact cover as The Kinks - The Kink Kontroversy. I was just wondering if anyone knows if this is deliberate or not. If so, have they ever done any Kink songs before? Well anyways I just thought that was cool."

She helps families understand the thoughts, needs and realities from the adoptee perspecitve. This is one book that I recommend to all adoptive families. A must have! It is required reading for our families."
__label__1,TAKE SEASICK PILLS B4 WATCHING!!!!!: This film would have been quite enjoyable if not for the cliched jerky spinning hand held camera gimmick that made us all sick in Blair Witch...it's really over the top in this movie and why arent we seeing films shot during the day....it wudda been just as scary especially the scene in the subway tunnel!!
__label__1,"Not much fun: My son doesn't really like this toy. I mean he likes the music which is very upbeat and he likes to play with the balls but he doesn't actually like to play with the toy as a whole. And there are the four ""feet"" on the bottom, that are so large they take up so much space on the floor and I don't really see a need for the ""feet"" at all. Plus the toy can't really be put away. We got this as a gift, it is not something I would have bought."
__label__1,"Left so many questions.: I read this book because I was recently diagnosed with vulvodynia. While it was a quick and easy read, it simply left so many unanswered questions for me. I know it's not exactly a textbook on the condition, so it wouldn't give me answers for my own situation. But I was finding myself frustrated that she didn't explore the situation about frequent urination, which is something I understand. I would have loved to know more about that, instead of her fight against it. It did make me appreciate how caring and understanding my fiance is compared to her horrible boyfriend.It's good for a light read to get more information about the emotions of women who suffer from this. But if you are looking for answers, look in other books."
__label__1,"boycott: Given this young performer's recent disrespect of the Catholic Church, the Pope, etc, I will not support her by any means."
__label__1,"What a downer. Save your money.: This book had such great potential. I tore into it the first night I purchased it and ended up reading until 2am. The first 3/4's of the book really intrigued me. I thought it was going to go down a particular road, but I was sadly mistaken. The story fell to pieces toward the end and I hurled the book at the wall upon finishing it. I felt cheated! Such great potential never realized."
__label__2,"wade seller ebay: Wade miniatures #2 is the top book on wades red rose tea and miniatures!!!BEWARE = there is a wade miniatures #3 it is word for word - page for page - price for price THE SAME AS WADE #2 so save money and buy #2 instead of #3,I hate it when I get ripped off by someone who claims to be giving me an updated price guide on a book I depend on.this book in either copy is the BEST for miniatures,"
__label__1,"Exploitative maundering: this book is repetitious and boring. In an apparent effort to publish something--anything--Bob Greene exploits the final illness of a friend. The details of their youth in Ohio are pedestrian, and he offers no particular moral or spiritual insights."
__label__1,Don't waste your money.: I was thrilled when I found these in the store and opened the box as soon as I got home to sample them. I then threw them out. They are nasty in my opinion. Way too crunchy and dry.

__label__2,I am so happy that I bought this!: My baby is 5 weeks and was taking a little longer to focus her eyes on people when she is held. But as soon as I attached Jaques to her crib she immediately looked at him and interacted with him. Focusing on the bright colors and looking directly at him! I have noticed marked improvement with her looking at me and following me with her eyes! I highly recommend this toy it is every bit worth the money!
__label__2,"amazing: This is perhaps both Reich's best work and the Kronos Quartet's finest performance. Different Trains is simply phenomenal. The piece consists of short ""pitched"" fragments of interviews Reich conducted, with always one instrument doubling the voice on the same pitch, over a quasi-minimalist texture with a few additional sounds (train whistles and such) in the background. The subject matter is train rides before, during, and after World War II, with the middle section obviously involving Holocaust stories. Uplifting, mesmerizing, heart-breaking, this piece is a must-have. Kronos is at their best, playing with great rhythmic clarity and an unusually nice sound for them.Electric Counterpoint is a nice addition to this disc. While it doesn't have the emotional content of Different Trains, it certainly provides an enjoyable listening experience. A reviewer below with more knowledge than I of the electric guitar and this performer has gone into greater detail."
__label__1,"Disappointing product from prestigious firm: The Sjoberg Elite workbeach is highly rated in a review by Fine Woodworking. However, I reluctantly agree with the other reviewer. The accessory storage case is way overpriced. And, as the other reviewer noted, it requires a great deal of work with handplanes to fit the drawers. Also, the packaging was poor. Given its weight, the packaging, expecially the corners, should have been far more robust. Mine was damaged in shipping. ecom offered to replace it without charge but, when I said I didn't want to go through all that, they volunteerd to knock some off the price to compensate for the damage. By all means, buy the Elite Bench itself, but consider making a compatible case of drawers yourself."
__label__2,"WOW!: Ok, all of you out there who thought that this movie was going to be dumb and not as good as the other two, wrong! I think this is the best. With the lead up and everyting to it, its fantastic! The Matrix launched you into it, and I had really no idea what was going on. The Matrix Reloaded was ok, but there was more psycho-babble going on than the first, plus that scene between Neo and Trinity was just too much bare skin for my taste. But The Matrix Revolutions was the best of all. Did you notice though, it has an uncanny resemblence to the book series, Dune by Frank Herbert? Heres the similarities: Neo is the one outcasts have been waiting for, he goes by a different name than the one he was born with in the Matrix itself, his great love dies, he becomes the blind messiah, there is a great war against machines, and, most significantly, he walks the Golden Path! I mean come on, as great a movie as it was, it could have been a little more original. Still, great movie, a must see for everyone!"
__label__1,"The worst war movie I have ever seen: This is truly the worst war movie I have ever seen, possibly the worst ever made. Practically every cliche of the genre is trotted out and poorly done. There is not the slightest trace of realism in the action scenes, in showing how troops move or execute tactics, in portaraying how the chain of command works or in showing how different branches of the service interact. The Vietnamese don't even look like Vietnamese. As a veteran, I find it amazing that anyone who was in Viet Nam could see this film as anything but ridiculous. On the other hand, I did watch the entire movie with morbid fascination, just to see how low things would go. If had been even a little better, I probably wouldn't have lasted half an hour."
__label__1,"Worst game I ever played.: Tries to be funny, comes out more like Postal 2. If you enjoy that sort of thing you might enjoy this; but for me it was one of the worst I have installed in years."

There last album was actually good, but this one.....no...go buy somthing else. It's not that bad, but i think it is boring. Alot of the songs sound the same. It just lacks creativity and beat. If anything, buy there last album instead."

__label__2,"These HEPA filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04152: Although it doesn't mention it, these HEPA filters also fit the Hamilton Beach Air Cleaner Model 04152. I had to email Hamilton Beach to find out, but they were very helpful and responded right away. When the filters arrived from ecom, I saw that on the box it says ""Fits Models 04162, 04163 & 04152.""With our cat and houseful of antiques, we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around. I run this model in our office, under the table which holds the computer. Since placing it there I have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated. I placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job. The regular settings can be louder than expected, but I leave them on the ""whisper quiet"" setting when we're in that room and I don't even notice them being on. I would definitely recommend the Hamilton Beach air cleaners."
__label__2,"A real life love story: This book beautifully captures the feeling and excitement one gets when first falling in love. Even though I am straight and married, I was totally drawn in to the relationship developing between the two main characters, both women, and I wished for them to find happiness together."
__label__1,"Too much like a computer adventure game: The plot of this story is too simplistic and too much like watching someone play a computer adventure game. The hero dies or fails the mission, so is repeatedly taken back to the previous spot to try again. Just like playing a computer game, dying, and them starting back from the last saved position. Q, rather than being the nuissance that he usually is, plays the role of the game's ""hint book"". There's also the feeling of limited choice in the character's action, just as with an adventure game. (For example, there are oonly three things that the hypo-syringe can be used for at the end, vs. the kind of open-ended use of things that exists in real life.)"
__label__2,"Turophile: I like this shampoo! High five. My hair is wavy and fine but there's A LOT of it. I've only been using the shampoo for about a week, but my hair seems less frizzled and tangled. The product is not thick; it's actually really runny. I think it works well though. I'd recommend giving it a shot."
__label__2,Inexpensive Knife: For the price these knives are great. After 2 weeks of ownership I have had trouble cutting through tomatoes already. I'm not overly impressed but maybe after I sharpen them they will be even sharper. I do recommend them.
__label__1,"Good product, HORRIBLE tech support: Good product, neat, small, useful. TERRIBLE HORRIBLE tech support. Long waits while techie looks up the simplest of questions. They're totally unprepared for the job. And I was given simply incorrect information which I had to wade through with more calls even to find out it was incorrect. If you're not a natural techie, expect a horrible experience with their tech support."
__label__1,not so satisfied: the product packaging was somewhat crushed when i got .....however more than than i think the floss action brush head itself is not a that great product to be praised on. its not so soft as i expected it to be and as advertised...plus its making the gaps between my teeth even more and more .....so overall i would not recommend this product to anyone.

__label__1,"pumps slow: It holds alot of gas but the pump is crap. it flows ok for a bit but then you nearly have to lift the thing higher to keep it flowing, and it's pretty heavy and defeats the purpose of having the pump...not worth the price."

I ended up purchaing this item for my husband who is in Iraq becuz its so hot there and he ended up with a pink fan. The paper he recieved with it said color may vary.....umm ok. So that didnt work out as planned. I was disappointed in the company. The fan is great if you can pick your color tho."
__label__2,"eurosploitation: the album is pretty good but after seeing them live twice I was left wanting more. If you have not seen them play live yet, you've done a great dis-service to yourself.

It is not so good as the ""Classic"" Friday the rabbi slept late"" but it is brilliant as well. Rabbi Small finds himself in troulbe (as usual): in a middle of a murder case and his job is in danger too. naturally he solves the problems with his clear logic, so you can count on the next stories."

__label__1,"Outdated and slow, leading to little Magic.: Seeing as there are many other effecient and productive magical systems avaliable for study, it baffles me as to why anybody would want to waste their time crawling along with this one.If you want to actually DO some magic, rather than simply considering it, or stopping short of really trying it (as this course does), then look elsewhere. I suggest Donald Michael Kraig's superb ""Modern Magick"" if the GD tradition appeals. At least Kraig's book gets to the heart of the WHOLE POINT for doing it in the first place, unlike this volume, which only discusses it in scared little whispers.Magic has moved on, and it's time that fact was recognised once and for all.So... don't buy this book, unless you like the picture on the cover."
__label__1,"Absolute rip-off: Change happens; deal with it. That is the total wisdom you will gain if you waste your money and an hour to read this grossly overpriced book. In 94 small pages of large type and full-page, repetitive illustrations, there is nothing useful. I have found more actual wisdom in a single Dilbert strip. The last several pages are nothing more than a blatant attempt to persuade gullible managers to buy the book by the ton. Apparently, that tactic has worked very well. I am not sure what that says about American business education, but it can't be good."
__label__2,"Another Bang up job from Bang on a Can composers!: SO Percussion ensemble is a hot young New York percussion group with an exploring sensibility and plenty of chops. The works included here are by two of the composers closely associated with the Bang on a Can Festival, Evan Ziporyn and David Lang. Ziporyn's ""Melody Competition"" evokes elements I associate with some of the music of Bali, not surprising considering that Ziporyn directs a Balinese gamelan ensemble at MIT. Lang's ""So-Called Laws of Nature"" is slightly more ambitious, evolving in three movements for different instrumental combinations. I like the 2nd movement, where bell sounds eventually evolve into drums, and the 3rd movement, that sounds like the joyful romping of children in a mound of broken glass. It's been a long time since a recording label produced such consistently excellent stuff. Thanks, Cantelope, for another beauty!"

I haven't been able to see it even on reruns for over 20 years, so I am thrilled that the first season has FINALLY been released. It's even better than I remembered: Buddy Ebsen is wonderfully understated as the soft-spoken, milk-drinking PI that does his own forensics work 1970s style. The picture quality and colors on this set are amazing. I can't believe anyone is carping about the price when it took this long for it to come out at all, but I guess some people can't be happy about anything.I can't wait for the Second Season. I would have bought the whole series at once."
__label__1,treatment ready: I believe this video should be used in treatment centers to show the progression and physical impairment created by alcoholism. I work in the field of addictions and feel this movie is one of the most realistic portrayals of addiction that Hollywood has ever made.
__label__2,I Love This DVD!: I love this DVD. I really like the lady from the Wendy's commercials. (Where's the beef?}. I laugh ever time I play it. I am slowly trying to convert all of my vhs into dvd's.
__label__1,"Ramblin' Rose: I did not enjoy watching this DVD, because the actors talked so fast I had to glue my eyes and ears to the TV trying to follow the dialogue. I understood why they talked so fast, because in R. Russell's book LIFE IS A BANQUET, she told how she had hired someone to add extra ""smart-aleck"" lines to the screenplay to add interest. In my opinion, it ruined the movie! That style of dialogue was not unusual for the era in which the movie was made, I realize."

I only watched the first 15 minutes and then turned it off. I've since found out what the ending is, but I'm not sure it justifies having to watch more than five minutes of film to get there. As a ten minute Twilight Zone episode, it might be great, but otherwise, please watch something else of her's."
__label__1,"be a woman and act like one: Why do women need to think like a man in order to lead them into commitment or marriage? The things said about men seem very judgmental to me and I have the opinion that most men are not as simple minded as described in the book. To respond to the example of the Japanese business man, the author mentioned. You do not need to think like the other partner to build a bridge for successful communication. You need to respect the other partner for who he is and be compassionate. It does not necessarily mean that you agree, but you allow the other person to be who he is, while you think and act the way you are. I encourage women to be authentic and men either like you for that or not. It might be a fun book for some readers, but not to be taken seriously."
__label__1,no good: This stuff just made my heart rate go up and made me feel like I was gonna have a heart attack all the time. My energy levels were the same and workouts did not improve anymore than normal. I figured I would try it my self to see if it worked and indeed it does not. I would not reccomend this product to anyone.
__label__1,"Used to be great: I first bought 3 sets of these in November of 2008. They have always been fantastic.The two sets I ordered in Sept 2010 frayed like crazy after the initial wash and dry cycle. In comparing them to the previous sets, it is obvious they have cheapened these towels considerably. If you look at the large image of the taupe towels pictured on the site and zoom in, you see a nice, thick embroidery running the length of the towels. This is how my sets from 2008 look. The embroidery on the new sets is less than half as thick. Also, holding a 2008 wash cloth in one hand and a 2010 wash cloth in the other, the 2010 one feels lighter.I checked back on the Nov 2008 order and it was titled 725 gram 100% Egyptian cotton - the same as these. They are clearly not the same.The 2008 sets have never frayed and since more than half of the towels had a ridiculous amount of fraying after the first wash, I returned both sets for a refund.It's a shame. These were great towels until they were cheapened."
__label__1,"Incomprehensible for Students: I previewed this film in hopes of running it for my 10th grade world history class. Usually, I find History Channel productions to be relatively good, but this piece is abominable. The narrator's voice is difficult to hear over the sound effects and music, and even when it can be heard, his phrasing and word choice is so pompous and garrulious as to be incomprehensible by students. Granted: students find most documentaries to be boring, but this one would inpsire a lynch mob. P.S.: The running time given in the product details above is not correct. The film runs 100 minutes, not 50."

__label__1,"An 'interruption' would have been welcomed....: Ignore the hype (not that there was much anyhow), ignore the 'Oscar' win (they never go to the right people) and most certainly ignore this dull and sickly 'melodrama'. Girl, Interrupted attempts to try and recapture the dark humour of the book but ultimately fails. The characters seem to be extras from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (yes, tics and all) and of course the obvious stereotypes are presented; fat girl, thin girl, extremely mad girl, dyke, etc. Even the introduction of Angelina Jolie as the psychotic and downright nasty Lisa fails to save this predictable mess from going downhill. Wonders how she bagged the Oscar, as her performance seems reminiscent of an OTT soap opera actress. Such a shame really, as the talented cast seem capable of better performances and films. A waste of time, money and talent."
__label__1,"AWEFUL!!: I wish I could have given this zero stars, only then could my distaste for the book be demonstrated. This is the first book which has both made me physically ill and been thrown away. I don't care how much I paid for it or whether I get the money back, I am certainly not selling it and subjecting others to it. It is nothing more than splatter porn, it does for books what SAW did for movies. I am sure there are some sickos who liked it but I will certainly be burning my copy."
__label__2,"rec'd on time, undamaged. car started up. time will tell: Quite exactly what my title suggests, my purchase ordered more quickly than expected and in perfect condition with sufficient packaging. My car started right up when I installed it. This is my first red top, so time will tell on the longivity or if I ultimately have to fight about the warranty."
__label__2,"Inspiring, Informative, and Insightful!: Please let me join the lengthening parade and climb aboard the band wagon. I like this work. As to whether it is merely a pale reflection of Catton, Foote, et al, or if it is a plowing of new ground in Civil War work, only time will tell. I thought it was a bit pricey, though."
__label__2,"One of the most moving, rewarding books I have read: I am a psychotherapist who works with children so this book had particular interest for me. With that said, Mira writes about her unconventional, absolutely brilliantly creative approach to working with ""disturbed"" children in ways that will deeply touch anyone reading her book. She could care less about diagnostic labels and her work with each child is geared strictly to that child - and these are children that most practitioners and doctors considered untreatable. Mira is an extremely genuine, direct and honest person who treated these children with respect. An amazing book."
__label__1,"not so good...: The examples are too basic, the design is boring and canned. If you have any graphic design skill whatsoever, you are already ahead of this book, even if you have never touched Flash.Buy Hillman Curtis' 'Flash Web Design' for inspiration about designing in Flash and the 'Flash 4 Bible' to figure out how to accomplish it. But don't waste your money on this one."
__label__1,"Somewhat boring: Granted that these books are meant for a young audience. But as we have seen with Harry Potter, you don't have to disintegrate into such simpering text. This particular book ranks as one of the worst books in this series.Wish that Dave (the one who wrote book number one) could've written the whole series."

It is functional and handy and trims well. I would give it 5 stars but I don't like changing the head for moustache trimming. Those that complain about the battery life probably didn't charge it fully and use it until the charge was depleted before re-charging. All and all another good Norelco.
__label__2,protects: My son says this is helpful when playing paintball and gives him added protection. The adjustable sides is a plus so depending on how many layers you need (weather and such) you can adjust for that and for human growth as well!!
__label__1,broke!: The switch on ours broke too; the whole piece just came off the lid. I have to fiddle with it to put it back on every time I want to use the grinder (which is why I'm replacing it now). I think we'd had it a month when it broke.It's not too loud and it probably does as good of a job grinding consistently as you can expect from a grinder in its price range.
__label__1,"Stay Away!: Stay away from this treadmill! Once I unpackaged this treadmill and put it in my basement I noticed that while the incline setting was at 0, there was still an incline to the treadmill. I contacted Lifespan about this and they said that this model of treadmill comes with a default incline even though the setting is at 0. WHAT????? Are you joking? That's what the incline mechanism is for! They said to unscrew the feet in the back of the the treadmill in order to get it level. OK, even though I should have returned the treadmill on the spot I decided to humor them and try to deploy the feet. This did not solve the issue either because THE FEET WOULDN'T UNSCREW FAR ENOUGH TO GET IT LEVEL!!!!!! The documentation that came with the treadmill did not mention any of this, neither did their website. For $2500 bucks this treadmill was a huge disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone."

__label__1,"Pretty poor quality -- missing pieces: I had high hopes for this, since I remembered these from when I was young. Unfortunately, we had to do some quick explaining at Christmas when we opened the package and there were no stickers! I ended up just throwing the game away."
__label__2,"Still A Favorite: I wrote the original review in 1998...now, almost 10 years and 2 children later, this book is once again the hands down favorite for nap/bed time. Our 22 month old son loves the beautiful art work: every page has a favorite image he points out. The story is well written as it moves through the parents' attempts to get their baby to sleep...good lesson in the story for parents I might add :-) I would highly recommend this book as a gift for parents expecting a child and/or with young kiddos."
__label__2,"Boxed Bevel Edge Chisels Set/6: Bought this as a gift for my husband who wanted to get started using hand tools for his wood projects. He was very impressed with the guality and thought they were a terrific buy for the price. He has not begun using them as yet, so time will tell how they are working out."
__label__1,"Silas Marner review: If you do not have to read this book, don't. It is very difficult to understand and catch on to, especially because of the slow plot build-up and the overall slowness of the book. It has a nice meaning to it but hard to understand because of the way the author words things."
__label__2,"Awesome movie!: Despite some unreal special effects, The Langoliers is an awesome movie! I have watched it over and over again. I can't get enough!"
__label__1,"Too bad~~~: I paid more than one hundred dollars on this toy, but when I received it, it looks very cheap, I mean the parts are made by cheap material and easy to broken; so I have return this toy already. Not recommend on this..."
__label__2,"Beautiful sound: I wanted chimes that sounded melodic and soft, and not atonal and tinny like some chimes can. This fit the bill. I'm surprised by how sturdy and large the whole thing is, for the price. If I have one complaint, it's that the whole setup gets lopsided rather easily. I have to straighten them up more frequently than I would like."
__label__1,Eh...: 360 watt max my a**! They were sounding distorted even by the 50 watt max head unit. Took way too long to ship.
__label__2,"Admins still need diskette drives....: Very good product, good price, fast delivery and usable with all systems and servers - very good !VD"
__label__2,"no problems with XP: I've had only positive experiences with my 1440, and while running under XP. I just downloaded the latest driver from the Brother website and didn't seem to have any problem. Yes, when you switch to 300dpi or toner save mode, the resolution is not the best, but given the overall quality of the printer, its ease of operation and the price (otherwise known as bang for the buck), I have to give it five stars. The HL 1440 is especially a good option if you're sick of paying more for printer cartridges on inkjets than on the actual printer."
__label__1,"Welcome Kit!!: I signed for this contract just for free Razar phone. Just after 1 week T-mobile came up with same deal but with 1yr contract. So I thought of returning the phone and taking up T-mobile service. But I didn't, because of the contract and cancellation fees. The welcome kit arrived after 40 days and it said I can cancel the service without any chanrges within 30 days. It was posted exactly after 30 days !! Beware !!So far the service is OK."
__label__1,"2001 Lesabre Floormats: The floormats are not a good fit in the front floor boards. Neither side fits like the manufacturers mats and they are not cut as seen in the picture. If you want something that is a meg shift fit, then these are for you."

__label__2,"New Balance Men's 574 Soes: I have several pair of New Balance shoes that I wear when running. When I saw the 574 line, I thought that the shoes would be great to wear to work. When I got the shoes, I was a little surprised that the back of the shoes were reflective, but otherwise the shoes were exactly what I expected. They are typically comfortable for NB shoes. I stepped right in and had no issues. I would have liked them better without the reflective surfaces and the big ""N"" on the side (after all, I am wearing them to work), but I do like them and will be wearing the to work. I typically put in a lot of walking time at work, so I have to have comfortable shoes and I really cannot get away with the typical sneaker look. So these shoes should work well for me."
__label__2,"THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!: I FIRST READ A JOYOUS SEASON ON A CROSS COUNTRY TRIP THE SUMMER OF 1974. I WAS ONLY 13, AND REMEMBER RELATING TO THIS STORY WRITTEN THRU THE EYES OF A CHILD. I MUST HAVE READ THIS BOOK A LEAST A DOZEN TIMES. UNFORTUNATELY, THE BOOK WAS LOST (OH HORRORS!) IN A MOVE. I'VE LOOKED HIGH AND LOW FOR A COPY, BUT HAVE HAD NO LUCK. I WOULD PAY ALMOST ANY PRICE TO HAVE ANOTHER COPY. PLEASE, WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE REPRINT THIS WONDERFUL BOOK?!?!?!?"
__label__2,"Good travel guide: Good reference if you are buying olive oil from lots of different countries, or going on a trip and want to include olive oil farms in your itinerary. Very well-written discussion of basic olive oil information. But check it out at your library before you buy. It is very good for what it is, but it may not be worth a spot on your home bookshelf."

__label__2,"Fantastic animation: The first VHD movie tried to stay true to the source manga but failed due to budget constraints. This movie however is as good as it gets, the characters appear in the correct lineup this time, and the voice acting is much better as it was originally created for english speaking dialogue (the japanese had subtitles this time). There is significant use of CG (computer Graphics) but this is totally un-noticeable and helps create perhaps the best looking anime ever made, even surpassing Ninja Scroll and Ghost in the Shell. MADHOUSE STUDIOS is my favorite animation studio, the did Ninja Scroll, X, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, a few spots in PetShop of Horrors, etc. Always top notch work from those guys."
__label__2,"Great parka: Exactly as described, very light, but warm parka. It's big, so you'll have to order at least one size smaller you normally wear. The only issue is that buttons are poorly stitched and fell off by the end of the first day. I restitched them all, so all good now. Not a big deal, otherwise it's a great product."
__label__2,"Tasty: This is a very palatable product, tasty actually! And, the container looks terrific on the kitchen counter!!!! I use it daily in my breakfast shake."
__label__2,"Straight thinking based on good data: Levitt's insights on the nature of ""experts"" is worth the cost of the book. All experts have an agenda. The public by and large has lost the Roman concept of ""buyer beware."" Each person must be responsible for his or her own life rather than relying solely on the opinions of experts."
__label__1,"Every pick had fallen out of the box !: These picks are probably great, but due to the packaging they come loose and then fall out the cracks in the box.If you buy these, unless it is packed in with many other items, it is unlikely these will ever reach you."
__label__2,"There is no Loch Ness monster, only a romantic heart in all of us: A parallel love story that will enchant you as much as the hunt for ""Nessie."" The vivid pictures Mr. Corrigan paints with his prose rivals poetry. He is to be read and savored again and again. The story will capture your heart and recall the thrill of love all over again. I found a pleasant suprise at the conclusion, which only enhanced my enjoyment more. The characters and the story will live in your memory long after the book is retired to the shelf. I'm looking for more stories from this most gifted writer."
__label__1,"Worthless: It took 70 minutes to read this book and it was a complete waste of time. Basically the book's advice is create a website and get people to pay you somehow. The big ideas are literally to sell something and the author hilariously give each thing it's own category like #20 SELL BOOKS and #44 SELL ART SUPPLIES! and #14 SELL BEAUTY SUPPLIES. Those are not different business ideas. Also, most of the ~~business~~ ideas are NOT internet business ideas they are normal businesses such as cleaning services, event planning, PR firms and numerous others that may ALSO benefit from having a website. But they cannot exist solely on the internet and would need a specialized skill set and the ability to go out and get the clients.The book is also annoying to read because it is repetitive, redundant and insultingly simple. It was written for idiots. I'm not an idiot so I found nothing of value in it. I don't recommend this book at all."
__label__1,"Too much of the illustrations are devoted to words!: At the age you potty train (2-3) the kids really respond to simple humor and interesting pictures. My one big problem with this book is that about 75% of each illustration is devoted to presenting each individual word of prose on the page. Even with the humor, there wasnt enough pictoral depiction of the sequence of sensing and doing the business! Not many kids this age are really going to focus on each word in the caption so I think the illustration allocation is totally off."
__label__2,"Great product, not so hot vendor: I have used the card reader several times with no problems experienced. That said, if I had to purchase again I would not do so from BLUEPROTON. My initial purchase was to be a 32Gb micro SD card. When I was ordering there was an offer, from blueproton, for free shipping on orders over $50 plus a free micro SD card reader. The micro SD reader shipped seperately and I was billed for both the product and the shipping. When the 32Gb card shipped I was charged for shipping again in spite of the fact that the billing price for the item was in excess of $50. I will never purchase another product from BLUEPROTON and I have lost considerable faith in ecom for allowing a vendor with so little ethical integrity to remain on their site.I would suggest to all who will listen that they look elsewhere for product."
__label__2,Good Game: Got this for my girlfriend at the time now wife. She liked it for about 5 months. Does not see much use now but is a really fun game.
__label__2,"If I were stuck on a desert island...: My all-time favorite album by anybody, anytime. I used to listen to some part of it everyday. Pick a bass line, a vocal track, a dual guitar lead, whatever. There is mastery in every component and yet these guys were so young! If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be the CD that I would hope to have! God bless the Allman Brothers."
__label__1,"This video is about 20 minutes long: An extremely cheaply made, WAY TOO SHORT documentary that doesn't teach anything that you couldn't get by spending a couple of minutes online. A complete rip-off, for the close to 40 bucks I spent on it."
__label__2,"Oh my darling how beautiful you are...: This song always makes me cry. I want to have Gone With The Sin tatooed on my chest.P.S. Surf Colorado, you're an idiot. If you dont like them, just don't listen. There's no trash music, but music you don't listen. Learn to respect !! Otherwise,you're just pathetic."
__label__2,"Flylady Baby~: This book was absolutely a joy to read ~ and as depressed as I am about my house right now, I do see hope..LOL! Easy to read and you just don't want to put it down. A+++++"
__label__1,"If not for vanity presses-This would not have been published!,: I can't believe I wasted my time reading this. I felt as if I were reading a childrens book. No history, no accounts of other people, just her cutesy monolog about ""little bitty things that go bump in the twilight"". NOT at all scary or historic. I would have settled for accurate but not even close. I couldn't even overlook how bad it was and just take down what was haunted because there was absolutely nothing there. I put the book in my bathroom where it has the slightest chance of doing some good. It's so embarrassing when one has guests and runs out of toliet paper."
__label__2,"Function packed in your pocket: Well, although I haven't had it very long... I like this multipurpose item. Being quick small and powered over USB if you like is really nice. I mostly use it in hotel rooms that don't have wireless to so I can move anywhere in the room.Make sure you update the firmware right away. You might also have to read the manual to figure out how the different functions work and how to connect to administer this thing. Basically each of the three fuctions act as a seperate device totally, so you have to make sure to set your admin passwords, features, etc. Over all I like it."
__label__2,"Watch your mouth: Well, Finally I bought this book and read it right through. The book gives us insights as to how we use our tongues for the good and bad both knowingly and unknowingly. It reflected the way I use my words to express sorrow, defeat and other negative things. It is true that we create our world with our words and we have to live in it. My best interest in the book was with the chapter Calling the things that are not. Read the book. you wont be disappointed"
__label__1,"Epic Fail: One of the worst products I've every purchased. Poor design clogs easily and requires frequent and messy cleanings to keep in operation. Even then, it takes forever to cut anything. My older Braun still does a better job (after 8 years!) than this does after one. Don't be seduced by the specs an neat-looking design. Where it counts, this fails completely."
__label__2,"Oscar is a delight !: A delightful comedy directed by John Landis (Trading Places, Coming To America) and starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) in one of his best performances to date. He plays a gangster who is trying to lead a clean life as a banker after vowing to his dying father (played by Kirk Douglas) to leave his life of crime. The events that occur on the day he will become a banker puts him and everybody around in one big surprise after the other. Funny performances by Marisa Tomei, Tim Curry, and the remaining cast.Oscar is a classic comedy despite the negative reviews it recieved when it was released. The audience loved it. Well at least I did!RecommendedA-"
__label__1,"too speed: hi,its good device but we cud not get this working.. quite complicated .. i wish only one blade made all the choping, shredding ,scling etc..and the motot speed was too high to control to get the desred consistency ! we are trying out to return this product !"
__label__2,"Great Vac!: This is an absolutely fantastic vacuum for smaller clean-ups. The suction power is better than what I had expected it to be and you get the same power running off the battery as when plugged in. This vac runs for a solid 15-minutes off a fully charged 18v XRP battery. As a contractor that does various types of work (and cleans up after my work), I HIGHLY recommend this Dewalt Vac. This was a great addition to my tool collection."
__label__1,Presentation device 1: Envelope arrived with only a velveteen pouch and directions - no device. I phoned ecom and they issued a refund. I emailed the vendor and had no reply.
__label__2,"Finally, a quality product: We've tried pads from the major retailers and they all have soaked thru leaving a mess to clean up. Look no further. They may cost a little bit more but well worth it. For reference we have a small Chihuahua. He stays in the utility room all day while we work. He has urinated as much as three times on the pad and no soak thru. Update - found for a much better price at Jeffers Pets, just google their name for the web site."
__label__2,Works great once you get it going.: The instructions could be better esoecially about the need to clone the mac address. I had to go to the DLINK site and browse through the faqs and to play aorund with the settings a bit to get it going. It's been working great since. I have 2 windows PC's and a Linux PC on the network using the DHCP server on the router. I even have the Linux box on the internet as a web server and I have set it up so I can telnet to it from work and access my home network.
__label__2,"Love it!: I use it for more than just flour and pastry recipes, and it's sturdy and holds up just fine with all of it. This product was an upgrade from a flimsy wire pastry blender that bent out of shape over time, so that's my only comparison, and this Norpro 3245 Grip Ez is awesome. Shipping was efficient, nothing wrong with the packaging, and no scratches or dents. I'm pleased."
__label__1,"Not as good as Rina and Peter!!: I was very excited to see a new novel by Faye Kellerman, but was soon disappointed. The story is extremely difficult to follow. There are too many characters and none of them are well developed. The only thing Ms. Kellerman hit right on the nail was her description of Las Vegas. Stick to what you do best and please give us more stories with Rina and Peter!"
__label__1,"Nice product but terrible screws: The product works well if you can get it installed. It's uncomfortable enough to install this type of thing. Nothing is worse than when you finally get it aligned correctly and you start putting the screws in and the screw breaks. I had 6 screws break within the first 5 latches I installed. I had to stop what I was doing, drive to Home Depot and buy different screws. They are that bad. Don't even start installing until you have replaced the screws."
__label__2,"Students' voices are finally heard: This book touches the hearts and opens the minds of everyone who reads it. It contains the voices and experiences of LGBT college students, former students, and those serving this population on college campuses. These stories are real. These lives are real. This book offers both reflection and validation of the experiences of an invisible population. Give it as a gift to someone. Better yet, buy it for yourself, and understand..."
__label__2,"good service doing double duty: This is an excellent product. I use it to slide bread onto the stone in the oven and to slide it out. It also is a fabulous cutting board that does not dull knives. It is high quality, approved for commercial/restaurant use. It can go into the dishwasher to get really clean. No warping, cracking, hand washing or need to oil like wood boards."
__label__1,"Beware of ramped up reviews: I enjoy westerns, Mitchum is one of my favorite underrated actors and, when it comes to movies I don't recall seeing OR hearing about, I am usually skeptical of strong reviews without the confirmation of well known ecom reviewers. This movie has a 'Top 500' reviewer and that sold me for an inexpensive bet. DON'T BITE!!You have to REALLY like Mitchum to justify this clunker. Maybe the issuers are building big reviewers just to take advantage of this kind of browsing."
__label__1,"only works as a charger, does not hot sync Tungsten E2: This cable is not for the Tungsten E2, it is for a Treo 600. It has no hot sync button and will not hot sync through software despite what they assert. Don't get it."
__label__1,"not worth it: The item took a long time to arrive, and when it did I was very disappointed with it. It cost a lot of money and the content was pretty much what you read in the books. The few pictures of the characters in the book are good, but not worth the price. I can see now why there are no preview pages for this book!"
__label__1,"Good movie, but I think the first one is the best!: Okay, I thought this sequel was going to have the same actors in it but it didn't. I got a little disappointed that I didn't see the same actors that were in the first one. But this sequel only had Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield. Where's John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John? This movie has gone way too far. I liked the other actors better but these are the worst actors I have ever seen. Do me a favor do not see this movie you will be a little disappointed stick with the first one."
__label__2,"The best recipes for everyday food: This is not a cookbook for the gourmets. This is for everyday people who love food made with ingredients readily available on the Gulf Coast. And the recipes really do yield results that taste like the restaurant's dishes. I've had the Crawfish Etouffe recipe made in Pennsylvania, and it was an exact duplicate of what I order at the restaurant.Eat at the Gumbo Shop whenever you can. The rest of the time, use their cookbook.Caroline JumperSan Jose"
__label__1,"Dangerous design: This popcorn maker does some things well, but the flip design requires that you flip it over to get the popcorn out. The first time I did this, my hand slipped and it burned my thumb pretty badly (blister) in about 2 seconds. I'd consider this design flaw extreme, and wouldn't recommend people, especially kids, use this maker."
__label__1,"Quiltigami - Terrible Book: I received this book for Christmas 2007 and made one of the flower wall-hangings. These are hands down the worst instructions I have ever tried to follow. I was so frustrated that I went on-line to see if there were any updated instructions or corrections and could only find a message board from 2004 with other frustrated Quiltigami users. It seems as though the author wrote the instructions, had someone illustrate it without reading the instructions and then had it published with nobody ever trying to follow the instructions before printing the book! I recommend not wasting your money. Find a paper origami book and try creating them in fabric. I wish my sister could receive her money back."
__label__2,"Absolutely great!! All PRINE fans will love it! Love it!!!!: Am a long time Prine fan. This album is great. Just love ""quit hollerin' at me!"" John has his own unique style of music and his songs tell a story.LOVE YA, JOHN"
__label__2,"better than I expected: When you read the reviews of other people, there is no doubt that you will get the impression that this might be the best album you could ever have, and it probably is. When I went to the record store, I originally wanted to buy ""the bends"", because of the title track, that was actually the song that introduced me to radiohead, I knew that songs like ""high and dry"", ""street spirit"" and ""fake plastic trees"" were amazing too but when I got to the record store they only had ""OK computer"", It definitely turned out for the best, because this CD is amazing, I actually tried to not like it but the songs grew on me, my personal favorites are ""no surprises"", ""lucky"" and ""let down"" and the song that made me say ""I like radiohead!""(which not everyone could easily say because of the fear of being pretentious)has to be ""airbag""."
__label__1,It's a ripoff: Don't waste your money. This is basically a few pages photocopied out of other books. There were almost as many blank pages as there were photocopied pages. Go to the LDS church's website (LDS.org) and you will find much more information - and it is FREE!
__label__1,"what plot?: Ok. I had heard she was a great writer, and I started with this book. At the end I was still trying to figure out the storyline. Too much bizarre sex, and no real live plot. I don't recommend this one. Maybe her other books are better. This one left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
__label__2,"Support Texas Local Music: If you like this album, try to find Quick Biomic Arms. This album consist of 6 songs and every song of is fabulous."
__label__2,"Great gun but magazines can be hard to load: This gun shoots hard and accurate. It has a nice weight, realistic appearance and feel, and it also can be disassembled like the real thing. The slide locks back when you're out of ammo. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is loading the magazine. The bb's are supposed to go in a zigzag pattern, but even with a loading tool you have to be very careful in order to actually get them in the zigzag pattern. If you don't then you'll shoot some blanks."
__label__2,"We are ""B"": The skeletal premise of this book is something that philosophers have been trying to instill in the masses for a long time, but have little success doing so: You have been told what to believe since the day you were born. Everything that you have been taught, is just that-- taught, not necessarily true.Just like `Ishmael' I didn't always agree with the argument presented to me, however, I cannot emphasize enough how important this book, and others like it are, because they present an entirely new way of thinking. One that is less myopic and arrogant. One that could very well save our species, if not the planet. Even if you don't agree with the conclusions drawn, the premises will still change the way you see the world, and THAT is important.However, read Ishmael first. If you don't like that book, then I doubt you will make it very far in this one."
__label__1,"So-so: I found it only moderately good at what it's supposed to do. I think a tennis ball or other small rubber ball would work as well. I used it to put pressure on sore muscles between my shoulder blades. It seems as if it might be too large for me to position well (I'm a 5'5"" male). It's not really bad, but seems overpriced to me."
__label__2,"Hoot is GREAT!!!: Hi!While I was reading Hoot I loved it, it's just the bad words were kind of crazy. Although, i could skip over because there wasnt tons. This book is my favorite and could throw Hunger Games series in the trash. The book is made for ages 10+ and i'm 13. Could not put the book down. What I really loved was Mr. Hiaasen's humor. I liked how Beatrice kept calling Roy ""cowgirl"" since he lived in Montana before Florida. I could make a suggestion though, I could have got rid of Officer Delinko and Mother Paula. Could really care less about them. Thanks for reading! Bye!! :-)"
__label__2,"True Sim Lover: Hi there all sims fans and those who are just discovering the sims. First in foremost I have loved The sims for the past four years and when I heard about the upcoming sequel in the sim series I was blown away. I have viewed screen shots, joined in chat and read chat transcripts that I missed,just to get as much information about the sims 2 as possible, and the more I found out the more blown away I became. If you thought the original sims was awsome there is no way you won't be impressed by the sims 2. After all it's not the best selling PC and in my opinion The Best PC game of all time for nothing. So if you ask me this is a game that's totally worth buying for fans of the sims or lovers of games abroad:-)!"
__label__1,"Try a 1 cent nail instead: I was too much of a geek to take the advice of the guy at the hardware store, so I bought one of these gizmos instead of a nail. On my walls, at least, this thing is useless. Basically, it finds many more studs than are actually present. So in the end I have to confirm its predictions by driving a thin nail through the wallboard and seeing if it hits wood. There are probably electronic stud finders that work, but this isn't one of them."
__label__2,"I love this book!: This is the best book I have ever read on affirmations and prosperity thinking. It fires you up!! I have very little time to read and have yet to finish the book. But, I am so inspired! Catherine Ponder is an excellent author. She makes the reading easy and even exciting. I make notecards as I go through the book and keep them in a card keeper. This makes it easy for me to do my affirmations at a later date.This book is huge! It is so packed with information. There's tons of examples of how people have used the principles of prosperity thinking to advance themselves and their situations. Each one used a different approach for the specific area where they were lacking. This book covers every imaginable situation. It really does! There is no stone left unturned. It is that thorough.The saying goes, ""You have nothing to lose."" Well, you have everything to gain by buying this book! It is worth every penny!"
__label__1,"The One Book for Epsonians based in US: The author forgot to mention in the foreword that the world is composed only of Americans using Epson printers, I am afraid.Should I live in US, I would award the book the usual five stars, on the other hand. But - if you are not a US citizen and, worse yet, believe that there are other printer brands than Epson, you have been warned."
__label__2,"An enchanting book!: This is a wonderful story with captivating illistrations, and good book for all ages. I loved it and read it over and over again"
__label__1,"A Krummy Krups: I have now ordered two of these coffeemakers, and they've both had the same problem with the opening/closing mechanism. The door to the coffee filter basket does not open properly or stay closed. Also, the water measuring tube often fills with air bubbles so you are unable to read accurately how much water you've poured in. I was very disappointed in this Krups product."
__label__1,"A tedious read: This brings a lot of new-age mysticism to rock climbing. There are definitely some valuable insights but you have to wade through a bunch of tired prose to find them. Overall, it won't do as much for your climbing as spending that time climbing."
__label__1,"Propagandist fairy tale: The other reviewers have already captured my experience of this film. I really enjoyed the lead actors, but the film, itself was such a disappointment. It is really nothing more than cheap political propaganda. I felt I'd been used."
__label__1,"Waste of money: I bought this capo for my 12 string Seagull and it is difficult at best to get this work. It doesn't have enough tension to hold down all the strings and often either pulls them out of tune or the strings don't play. The closer you get to the headstock the worse it is. Not once have I ever been able to get it to work on the first fret, second fret is maddening, 3rd fret is slightly less maddening, fourth fret, hit or miss, and so on, it only gets marginally better as you move up the neck but what's the point of a Capo if you can't use it anywhere on the neck that you need to.I have a Keyser capo for my 6 string Washburn and it works beautifully, I just think they don't put enough tension on their ""12 string"" capos to be be effective. So I'm off to find a new better capo for my 12 string. If you are Seagull 12 string owner don't waste your time, energy or money on this capo you will only end up poorer, and more frustrated."
__label__2,Great gray coverage and natural looking color: I use this product about every two months. It has great gray coverage and natural-looking color. I have received many compliments on my hair color with this product. My only complaint is that it can start to burn my scalp towards the end of the processing time. But the feeling goes away after I wash it out.

__label__1,"Deja Boo!: David Ash is a paranormal investigator haunted by the childhood death of his sister, he finds escape at the bottom of a bottle. David is sent to debunk the claims of a haunting at the estate of the mysterious Mariell family. While there he is forced to confront his own demons while battling malevolent manifestations in the home. This character also appears in Herbert's ""Ghosts of Sleath.""Well if you've seen ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others,"" (Not Herbert's ""Others) you pretty much know what's coming by the first few pages. Unfortunately, the element of surprise is the entire foundation of the book, it's what the suspense is building to. With that gone, there are no engaging characters, no sense of atmosphere, nothing to really hold the interest. Worst yet, when David falls in love it annoyed me, as there seemed no basis for it except to up the stakes for the ""surprise"" ending."
__label__2,"Free Your Mind: The Danielson Famile provides perhaps the most innovative, unique approach to song-writing and execution in the last 20 years. With the fervor of the Oblivans, they run head-first into songs without the pretense of production or market appeal.Make no mistake, this is religious music in the truest sense.While ""A Prayer..."" is the least refined of their recordings, it doesn't lack what makes their music infectious and joyful.Listen once... then promise to listen 10 more times before giving up on them."

__label__2,"No Problems: KitchenAid JE Citrus Juicer Stand Mixer AttachmentI greased the shaft with butter as suggested earlier and made short work of two bags of lemons that were as big as grapefruits from my uncle's tree in Indio, CA.I didn't use the included strainer but a sieve over the mouth of a large bowl instead. Worked just fine to keep the seeds and pulp out of the juice. I couldn't get the juice to run down my arm as others report experiencing, so I don't understand how it can be a problem.As a comparison, last year I bought a DeLonghi Citrus Juicer and the motor burned out before I juiced one grocery bag of lemons.I'd have to say that this KitchenAid attachment is every bit as good at the mixer I use it with."
__label__1,"I am still trying to get the doll set up --Very disappointed grandmother!!!: I purchased two dolls for my granddaughters. We are still trying to get the dolls set up. Although we've followed the instructions we've had problems. The dolls continue to say that batteries are needed, when we put brand new batteries in them. Their eyes won't open, their mouths will not move. We are just plain disappointed with them. The dolls could really be wonderful---that's if they would work. I live in a different city and therefore, had to live my grandaughters with half operating dolls to their disappointment. I have told my daughter to return the dolls for a refund."
__label__1,"This phone sounds like you're in a tunnel.: When you are talking on this phone, the person to whom you are talking sounds like they are in a tunnel. It works the same on the other end. i.e., on a speaker phone. Also the phone is very unattractive. I haven't had it long enough to rate the battery life."
__label__2,"Good for the money.: This style of exercise bike is exactly what I needed. It relieves a lot of the stress from my back and shoulders while allowing me to get a real workout, especially at higher resistance levels. Putting the bike together wasn't hard, except for a snag or two with the wiring to the computer. (Once I figured out that the pieces snapped together after a lot of pressure and didn't require tape, the monitor worked almost flawlessly.) The bike itself isn't built excellently, and it rickets back and forth a bit at faster speeds, but considering how much I paid for it, it's a minor issue. A comfortable seat, adjustable lengths, and the near silence of operation make this an easy piece of machinery to come back to.(By the way, the calorie counter is useless. If you multiply the number of miles you've traveled by 35, regardless of what your speed and resistance levels are, you'll get the same calorie readout as the monitor.)"
__label__1,Slow Paced and Dragging: Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
__label__2,Great service: My wife has been using this product for long and she is quite happy with the results. I always order it in ecom and get it on time. I would like to receive more goodies next time as this is the way my wife learnt about this product.

__label__1,"Critical Mistake: I usually am very loyal to authors I've come to prize and buy their hardcover editions to show my support. I had a collection of Steve Martini's work right up until I bought Critical Mass.I know everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I also am entitled to not having to pay for someone mocking mine. Specifically by ridiculing a President and his wife whom I enthusiastically support.Dale Brown did the same thing some time in the past and I quit reading the offending book mid-page and tossed all of his work. Tom Clancy did a similar thing when saying that he felt persecuted for smoking (after all, it wasn't like he had AIDS!). Out that pile of paper went.I hope Martini feels better now that he's catharsis'ized his political opinions, and that the good feelings are enough to offset the minimal amount of discomfort my ceasing to further contribute to his income will cause.Plus, look at the book shelf space I freed up!"
__label__2,"(+): It is evident with this particular book, that long and hard hours were spent to detail a topic that few really believe is true. The author works to bring fact (old rail lines, old rail towns) and fiction (headless lampmen, ghost passengers) together into a form of entertainment suitable for reading. Any person who spent even the slightest time as a child walking along a rail line, or as a ticket holding guest will enjoy the mixture of realism and folklore. If you don't care too much for the ghost part of it, fine ... the historical documentation is rich. And if you want to hear about campfire 'lore, Mr. Reevy supplies not only the stories, but sometimes the people who tell them."
__label__2,"Real and Personal: Jeannie St. Marie tells a very entertaining, poignant, and personal story -- her real life experiences with John Denver. A must read for anyone desiring an inside look at the mega-star's intimate side. Jeannie's conversational and down-to-earth writing style makes you feel as if she's right in your own living room. Through her eyes, I've come to a new level of appreciation for John's beautiful musical works and his passionate spiritual service to our world. Many John Denver facts and reference sources are also included."
__label__2,"AN EXCITING DEBUT!: This book swept me along as if I were riding on a fire truck. The excitement never waned, and the details about fire equipment and fire fighting were intelligently explained to this layman. I look forward to the next Georgia Skeehan book. Mac sounds like a really promising romantic interest; I hope he appears in the next book."

__label__2,"Should be seen and discussed by all Christians: This documentary is about a Church with a vision they are convinced is from God. At least their pastor thinks so and convinces his congregation to get on board. As the story progresses we start to see how severely deluded this vision is. The filmmaker did not try to make these people look foolish. He lets them tell their own story. The Church has some extremely likeable people including the Pastor who guides them. They are very sincere people and are geniune Christians devoted to God. As things begin to unravel for them, you wonder why God did not intervene in some way. I think this is an important film that needs to be seen and discussed by Christians in small groups. It would be an ideal place to begin a discussion on ""Is that voice we hear really from God?"" or a hundred other topics of people attempting to serve their Creator. Highly recommended."

__label__2,"Really Super Product: I have used Curlaway for about a year now and my hair is absolutely fabulous. It took some time to understand how to apply the product for the best results, but once I did....great. Hair must be pulled straight during both the application and the drying process or it just flops.I no longer have any breakage, my hair is bouncy, looks great, full of body and has grown faster than ever before. I would never consider using a chemical relaxer on my hair again."
__label__1,"HORRIBLE!!!: Acting was good, but there is absolutely NO plot. There are some funny lines, but its not worth the money to even rent it. There is some descent action in the last 15 minutes, then a little tear jerker, but I feel like I just wasted 2 hours of my life."

__label__2,"Great easel: We purchased this easel for our daughter's 3rd birthday. It was by far the best gift she received. While she's not too into the chalkboard, she paints or uses the dry-erase board every day. We assembled the easel on the shortest setting and it's just perfect for her even though she's a very petite 3 year old. We love the fact that it is height adjustable and will grow with her but in order to change the height, the easel has to be completely taken apart and reassembled. Other than that, this is an amazing product!"
__label__1,"Returned it: Bought this because of all the positive reviews, but returned it right after trying it once. It hardly had any suction power and felt very cheap and flimsy. Maybe something was wrong with the one I received, because it's hard to reconcile what I got and what other people say about this vacuum. But I felt strongly enough to write a review. It's the weakest vacuum I have ever used."
__label__2,"Reymond integrates Paul as theologian and Missionary: If you appreciated Reymond's systematic theology, you will also appreciate this book. Based originally on his lecture notes, it has grown through several stages to the current publication. It's divided into two major parts. The first, ""Paul's Missionary Labours"", derives from his study of Acts and Paul's letters. He also argues for Pauline authorship of Hebrews. The second part of the book (Paul's Missionary Theology), treats major orthodox doctrines, based on Paul's writings. There is a thought provoking chapter at the end of this book, ""Lessons from Paul's Ministry for Today's Missionaries"". In it, I believe he underscores the necessity of sound doctrine as it relates to proclaiming the gospel to the nations. This book should be valuable to all who are interested in, or active in missions or evangelism in any way. There is an extensive bibliography, and scripture index which should be helpful for further study."

I was fine before only with a year old lower back issue. My left knee developed a serious problem and then the back of my legs are in bad shape from use of this machine. I have to invest in a chiropractor now. I'm a woman, 48 and would like to caution older people that this product can do more harm then good."
__label__2,Kubrick's Best: and the only film he ever made that truly has withstood the test of time. While his brooding pretentiousness got the better of him through the '60's until his death--this film is an honest and straightforward Hollywood movie in the best since of the word.
__label__1,"Californication empty shadow of earlier works: I feel sorry for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It must be hard to keep up the energy and vitality and fire and emotion that exudes from Blood Sugar Sex Magik and other earlier albums. I can picture the musicians recording this album--particularly drummer Chad Smith--just beating away to yet another song with the same groove as 39 of their other songs. I believe that RHCP still want to innovate--and their skills are musicians are formidable--but this album is not the forum. There is nothing new here. It's still RHCP--Kiedis' focused, penetrating vocals will not disappoint--but the album lacks the freshness and punch of earlier works."

But as I tested the temp of the oil, I got the feeling that the thermometer's calibration was off. So I tested the temp of the oil with my Thermapen Instant Thermometer and, sure enough, the deep fry thermometer was off by 20-degrees. That would have been enough for a 3-star rating, but even worse, after calibration the deep fryer thermometer didn't hold the calibrated temp. The only positive thing I can say is that the thermometer is easy to calibrate - and it should be since calibration is required so often."

In this book she wasn't which was the first thing that made it bad. Second, it was over with in the third book. It didn't need to come back. But don't listen to me, after reading Christopher Pike's books I've hated the way RL Stine writes. I want to be a writer and I'd never take after Stine!"
__label__1,"Do not bother buying this one: To anyone considering buying this book, I suggest you read it in the store. It is definitely not worth a dime. As for reviewers calling Malkin ""the best of the best"" know tha t unless you know nothing about history or ethnic studies, you will probably be impressed by this. The reader is drowned by her conviction and well, that's about all that keeps this historical fantasy a page-turner. Just read her blog for a dose of hate, it's free."
__label__1,"poorly written and pompous: Although he often tries to act humble, you get the feeling that Mr. Piper is actually quite self-centered and a bit arrogant. I was particularly turned off by his judgmental attitude toward non-Christians. I personally don't believe Piper actually saw Heaven. I think he never really died and was just hallucinating."
__label__1,Not his best: I am surprised at how many people like this album compared to his other solo albums as I dont like the 'bitty' jazz feel to this compared to the more rocky feel to eg.Hard Wired. Some moments are good and there actually are a couple tracks which dont just dissapear into an off the wall brandon fields sax solo and the less said about the one with his daughter on vocals the better... Dont get me wrong I am a big Weckl fan but I somehow feel his best days are gone.

I remember as a kid seeing gliders made of metal with springs that groaned and made up of fused together rust. After reading other reviews and taking a chance, I bought it. It went together easily enough except for one locking bolt that did not line up. I had read another reviewers suggestion that I keep a drill handy, and with that and a little persuasion, it came together fine. Even though the wood was treated at the factory, I live in Florida where everything gets old before it's time,so I gave it a treatment with teak oil. It looks great, feels solid and is very comfortable. Great buy for the price."

__label__1,"just ok: Diana Krall has always been a Artist that I respected Her talent,but I never quite got the full buzz over,but over her past two albums I'm really lost now,because Her voice doesn't work well in a bigger band enviroment. She is better suited in a smaller unit that allows her instrument of voice to be heard&given that feel she is known for doing in her material. there is way too much going on in the overall sounds&they don't blend with her vocally enough. She doesn't have enough in her Chops to keep up with what she is trying to pull off here. I applaud the effort,but she has to get back to what best compliments her stylings."

The Lasser is not my primary text, and I assign reading about once a chapter (6-8 days). My kids complain about the Lasser because it is more abstract and opinionated than their text. I try to tie the article to current events and class discussion. The Lasser covers lots of ground, giving you atleast one article on your curriculum topics. The comparative section is impressive, but I don't teach a comparative class, so we don't go there to often. It's tough reading for the above average high school junior, but I insist they read."
__label__2,"This should be the bible of dog training.: This book is eye opening, gives the dog a lot of credit for figuring things out on his own, in my mind turns out the author is justified. Very satisfied, opened up my eyes on giving the pup a lot more leeway. After 8mo. I can say the system is sound, I used it on a rescue pup with some trust issues and at 1 1/2 yrs, 8 of those months with us, he had himself an awesome season. Started out a little slow, but as he went he learn, then he had one day where he just broke out and never looked back. Very satisfying to see where he came from, to where he is, I am convinced he would not have responded to heavy handed training."

There is almost nothing left of the beautiful Irish folk themes, which you can find on ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"" and ""Talk on Corners"". If it weren't for the last instrumental track, it would sound like another Spice Girls album..."

Most of the goodies section is about what happens in each episode, which any fan of the goodies knows anyway.Disappointing."
__label__2,"Best PDA ever: I bought this Palm Z22 as a replacement for my first Z22, which was stolen during a recent office burglary. My first one cost about a hundred dollars, and a new one, ten years later, is an astonishing $275. However, I found several used ones that claimed to be in good shape, so I bought one, for less than $100. It works perfectly, it's as good as new. No better tool for appointments, phone numbers & alarms for meetings. I don't have a smart phone, and don't need one, so the Z22 is a perfect office tool for me."
__label__1,"Too much ego: I enjoyed this book - the cover's mountain scenery, a review of raja yoga, and the rendering of experience to poetry. But many chapters close with boasting, hardly contained. And that contradicts the overall message, surrender of ego to embrace the divine. Then there was the author's YouTube statement that Babaji is ""der feurer"" which is to say ""the leader."" But why that choice of words? Freudian slip? A cultural thing? Is it that the Indian culture is more deferential to authority than the American? What seems harsh or even wacko to me, might be nothing to someone else."

We were on a trip in Switzerland so a friend took it in and got it serviced. I don't know what they did, it was still under warranty. Anyway, now it's been two years, about 6 months since I got the watch back and it is even worse than before. Now the only thing that works is the altimiter, I can barely get it to tell time anymore.

I searched high and low for an FM Transmitter which would enable me to position the Zune in an upright and safe position in my automobile. The TuneBase fulfilled this requirement, however performed poorly as far as reception is concerned. The reception was terrible. Also, I was not able to tune to 87.9, which is the only station that will work where I live. I bought this produce because it has the base for the Zune, however the transmitter is not better than the Zune tranmitter purchased from Microsoft. Belkin needs to go back to the drawing board a develop the product the right way instead rushing to the marketplace with an inferior product."

The largest single section of the book was about breeding cichlids-- there was not a lot of discussion about individual species, compatability, or how a beginning aquariast might be able to start a cichlid aquarium. The book did have some interesting information about cichlids in their native habitat, and a few fun anecdotes/stories. However, as an aquarium neophyte, I found I had little more practical knowledge about keeping cichlids after I read this book than before I started."

Most of the book is spent teaching the beginner how to knit, which I have no qualms with, except to say that there are tons of books out there that do that and do it better. There are only a few patterns in the book, none of which are original and all of which are, frankly, unattractive. There are 2 multicolor ponchos which use a variety of yarn types, but the colors used are hideous. Even when trying a project like this using leftover yarn from your stash, most of us would try to pick yarns that complement each other. The worst part of the book though is the constant name-dropping for name-dropping's sake. In many cases, the entire point of Eig's anecdotes are tell the readers how close she is with the stars. If you like the Hollywood angle, try Hollywood Knits Style by Suss Cousins for patterns that are more original."

Regardless, the pleasing trickle of water from the candle spouts was overwhelmed by the churning machine below. Can't recommend it."
__label__2,"Starts out slow, only gets better: This is one of the best animes I have seen in a while. While the first episodes (the ones in this DVD) are a little slow, and weird (talking to a doll), if you can get past that, the storyline develops and hooks you until you won't want to stop watching it. Overall, there are some cliche anime things here and there, but the production quality is high, and it has a unique blend of genres. A little sci-fi, romance, comedy, and action all put together form an unforgetable experience."

All the while, Americans are willing to let him do as he pleases in the name of not upsetting the balance of our economy (read: greed). His defenders state that he did what every other man in his position would have done. Not everyman is president, and clearly, Bill Clinton, is a man who cannot handle the responsibility of the Oval Office and should be removed."
__label__1,"I would rate lower if a lower rating existed: I have this book because it is requred for the course in computer architecture I am taking. In addition to the stuff the other guys above wrote which is all true, it has the infuriating habit of placing figures overleaf the explanation for the figures."
__label__2,Great: I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. It really shed some light on myself as well as others in my life. This book is well worth it.
__label__1,"WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ: it was just bland and boring, thats all, the plot was ok, but not worth reading. the only reason i'd buy is so that i could use it for scrap paper, or maybe for oragami. otehr than that, its honestly useless."
__label__1,"Overwritten, sexist and dull: I would give this book zero stars if I could. The narrator is unlikeable and misogynist. His descriptions of his adult daughter I found frankly creepy. The prose is horribly overwritten - florid and clumsy, with unbelievably clunky dialogue.In general, if I buy a book on ecom and don't care for it, I can't be bothered to return it; this particular book inspired me to pay the postage and send it back. Not recommended."
__label__1,"Only Able To Enjoy Two Games: I was only able to install and run two games from this set. I really enjoy The Web, and Creep Night, although has ""cartoonish"" graphics is highly enjoyable...but I have no idea what the other games included in this set are like because they froze my computer up and wouldn't install. Instead of wasting your money, buy Creep Night and The Web individually...sometimes quality is better than quanity."
__label__2,"NEVER buy cheap tape!!: Tape is one of those items that can be incredibly frustrating when bought in low quality. It is simply not worth it to re-do anything because I wanted to save 1 penny per foot on tape and buy some cheap Chinese electrical tape that cracks, gets stiff, and comes apart in the cold, or melts and gets gooey and messy and slides off the work when it gets hot. This USA made 3M tape is excellent quality for general use but the thicker 3M 88 tape is best for ultra-heavy duty use. I use both and have NEVER regretted paying that extra penny per foot. I'm too cranky and lazy to re-do work because of cheap tape."
__label__2,"One of the most interesting books I have read: Mohammed Odeh al-Rahaief has written a riveting story about his life in Iraq and his dangerous adventures in struggling to help save Jessica's life. It was eye opening to see what life in Iraq was like, and I love the way the book was written in a very interesting manner. I couldn't put the book down and I would recommend it to everyone. It was so inspirational to read about someone who acted so selflessly by putting his own life and that of his family's on the line to help another human being who was not even from his country. He lost the vision in one eye during the perilous adventure to try to help Jessica. I hope his life will be richly blessed and those who come in contact with him and his family will be caring, generous, and supportive. I am proud to have Mohammed and his family in America."
__label__2,"My favorite in the series: Of all the wonderful videos in this series, I love this one the most. The fictional plotline that is woven around the facts here is perfect for Rossini; a sort of chaotic, lighthearted, and charmingly Italian tale (love, friendship, good music, and good food) that reflects his musical personality quite well. The little girl is a sweetheart, and there's just enough touches of romance and intrigue in this one to keep my 5th and 6th graders completely riveted."
__label__1,"Didn't Enjoy This Book: I really didn't enjoy this book. The only things I really liked about this book were the sexual chemistry between the characters and that the little boy was adorable. With that exception, I found the story and the relationship lacking. She also used what I believe was Jamaican dialect through too much of the book, too often, and it lost me. Using the dialect made it hard to follow, those parts could have been key in drawing me into the book, but it didn't. Lastly, Ms. Esdaile makes attempts to make the characters more ""hip"" by using slang, which she has done in other novels too, and it just didn't work for me. This book may work for some, but it just doesn't for me.This was my second or third attempt at reading Ms. Esdaile and I finally gave her up after reading this book, which is a shame since she sets most of her books in Philadelphia and it's always nice to read stories set in towns I'm familiar with."
__label__1,"Scattered, Hard to Follow, Could not finish it.: I wanted to like this. I am not a religious person, but I did enjoy the Left Behind series, I love end of the world books and though I'm not a believer, I find religion interesting for its relationship to history and its effect on society. This book however, is terrible. It is scattered and confusing. There is no flow at all. The characters are not believable or likable. Let me put it another way. If I had not had the book jacket to tell me what it was supposed to be about I would have been completely lost. As it was I was completely bored and confused. I made it about 1/3 of the way through before I threw it in the trash.I am surprised it found a publisher and for my own sake, I wish it had not since I wasted my money on it."
__label__2,"Reasonably happy: I started using this with my older male cat after a friend recommended trying it. It seems to work fairly well. My cat has only gone to the bathroom outside the litter box once since I switched. I also started using theFeliway Plug-In Diffuser with Refill, 48 Millilitersat the same time, so it's hard to say which one has a bigger effect. However, this definitely is more expensive than regular litter, so I may try going back to regular litter. It seems to clump better than the normal Tidy-cat/etc litter I was using before. Unfortunately it seems to do a worse job of suppressing odors. Tracking outside the litter box is about the same as other litters I've used. My cat wasn't *marking* outside the box before I switched to this, so I can't comment on how effective it is for that problem."
__label__2,"This was recommended to me by a mechanic friend.: I first learned of this tool from a friend that's a mechanic. So, when I was working on a car where I thought this would come in handy (2000 VW New Beetle) on, I bought it.It made life SOO much easier. Although I've only used it one time on one car, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again. I think it's a good tool to have around the shop!"
__label__1,"This is made for a person with minature legs: The quality of the fabric and stitching appear to be very good. It is comfortable and warm. However, the fit is anything by normal. The crotch is halfway to my knees and the pant length is very short. I am 5'9"" and weigh 185 and ordered a large. My inseam is 30"". The shoulders and sleeve length fit comfortably. The pant length goes just to the top of my boots but when seated on my motorcycle, they ride up to above the top of the boots. Hence, my legs get cold and it defeats the purpose of having an insulated suit. When walking the very low crotch is cumbersome and just plain looks silly. I returned this item."
__label__2,Happy Neil fan!: I would consider this Neil record one of his most successful and artistically satisfying works.
__label__1,"The product carried by ecom is grey market: The item I received from ecom was an authentic Michael Kors fragrance. However, the serial number was etched off the bottom of the bottle. The fragrance inside was also very degraded and old. It didn't smell anything like the sample I have. This product was either exposed to heat or light in storage. The other fragrances in my package were fine."
__label__2,"LOVE this flatware!!: I was tired of our old stainless steel flatware that was dull and worn. I fell in love with the pattern online and wasn't disappointed when it showed up. It's a classic pattern that won't go out of style, it's shiny and elegant but simple enough for everyday use. I like the distinct differnce between the place fork and salad fork. And don't know how I got by previously without all the extra teaspoons. We've only had it a month but I love it and know it'll last forever."
__label__1,"Faulty Design: Don't buy this or any of Philips' TVs. The electronic board is poorly designed and will, fry itself. If you're lucky, like me, it'll fry itself in the first month so you can get warranty work for free.. Otherwise you're going to pay about the price of the TV to repair it.Philips is extremely uncooperative. It took 5 calls to their support line and finally a series of letters to the Better Business Bureau to get them to authorize warranty work on a faulty set. Then it takes a month to get repaired.Save yourself an extra $100 and get the crappy daewoo. At least you won't be out $270 for a tv when it breaks."
__label__2,"Superb book!: One of the few scientists to stand up against the AIDS propaganda that has stifled dissent and discussion of the real causes of AIDS, the author deserves kudos for finally putting it all down in writing. A valuable book for anyone interested in free inquiry and scientific discussion whether they are interested in AIDS or not."
__label__2,"An interesting read: I purchased this book at the recommendation of Sonlight Curriculum for my kids to read. I read the book in a couple of evenings and learned a bit about Napolean myself. I found the book one I would recommend more for high school aged girls than any aged boy as it had some details that I wouldn't want my son reading about-things that don't bother girls as much. I wish the author had read Betsey's diary before writing so she could be as accurate as possible in the presentation, but the book did succeed in putting Napolean in an interesting light for young readers."
__label__1,"nice characters, really slow story line: the lead characters were very well developed, esp the heroine. they both were charming and surrounded by other characters who possessed the same qualities. my biggest gripe is that the story moved at a snail's pace. a good editor could have tightened this novel up and it would have been much more enjoyable. as to the plot line with the villian, no real explanation as to the animosity there. great history lesson though."
__label__2,awesome: An Amazing toothbrush. I will never go back to anything else. Gives a great clean feeling. I like the 2 minute timer so I always know I am cleaning thoroughly.
__label__1,"Hangs and denied Rebate: The unit hangs every other night on downloading data from the telephone, the unit doesn't get some channels, they say the signal strength is too low and they denied my rebate claim saying I didn't send in the UPC code, which I am 99+% sure I did, especially since it is missing from my box. Buy the TIVO."
__label__1,"A waste of a great ensemble of actors: Although I was warned by a friend that this movie wasn't that great, I went ahead and rented it anyway.The big attraction to this movie for me was the top actors. I love Samuel L. Jackson, and Colin Farrell, and figured with these two involved the movie couldn't be that bad.Well I was wrong (yawn) after enduring predictable dialogue and action scenes that seemed unexciting and very repetitive to say the least, I wish that I had saved the money and spent it elsewhere. No real story line, boring scenes, and nothing that even slightly got my interest, I would say that this was a fine set of actors used in a very disappointing way.Don't waste your time or money on this one."

__label__1,"Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now."
__label__2,Absolutely perfect!: Order was received in three days! Not 3-4 weeks as estimated (ships from England) with standard shipping. Fits perfectly in my 2012 X5. The pictorial instructions leave a little to be desired but it still took less than 30 mins to install. It was definatley worth the price.
__label__2,"I love this book: This is my 3rd book I have been through. I use this in my daycare and all my kids love it. It is part colored foil and all interactive(kids will flock to this book) It promotes counting, colors, shapes, compare and contrast and time"
__label__1,"Unconvincing: Acrosleuth clearly draws inspiration from the more musically complex contemporary electronica outfits (especially the likes of Plaid and Download). However, ""Acrosluke Firewalker"" has nowhere near the impact of these more successful acts, largely due to the fact that the various instrumental parts fail to gel together and provide a cohesive whole. Even though the liner notes suggest a healthy dose of ""real"" organic instrumentation, the majority of the album is remniscent of the rather plastic sounding MIDI-generated music from the '80s. This is particularly disappointing in the light of more recent developments on the electronica scene, where ProTools sonic manipulation and more flexible generative software are becoming the norm, opening up musical vistas well beyond conventional twelve-tone sensibilities."
__label__1,"Nope!: Four technicians at Avery, two at MC...no one was able to get DesignPro to work on my MAC. Avery won't support Safari, Firefox won't support Adobe on Avery. 4.5 hours and I can't print one label.No, Avery, just NO."
__label__1,"Good message, lousy execution.: While the information provided may be engaging in a discussion after viewing, the production value of this movie is absolutely horrible. Filmed in someone's backyard, the noises of the cars and birds in the background are incredibly distracting, and the actors tend to flub their lines quite a bit. Granted, I understand that the message that is being relayed through the movie is key in understanding the role postmodernism plays in relation to therapy, but the shoddy workmanship that went into this detracts from the message. It was painful to sit through."
__label__2,Great Book: This was a real page turner. Can't wait to read more about Sarah. The characters were so believable. One of those books I didn't want to be over at the end.
__label__1,"Fraught with so many basic errors: This is one of the most ridiculous books I have read on the subject. It is written by a someone who OBVIOUSLY did not do his homework. The medical terms are used completely wrong. The description of what actually happened has so many errors (what he thought happened and reality) that it ruins his message. The message of the book, (I think is valid) but is much better described and explained in ALL of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross books. (Scientist, MD, researcher). Waste of your time, even if its free."
__label__2,grandaughters baby: I bought this doll because I have a red haired grandaughter that is turning one and I wanted a doll that looks like her.Its beautiful! It looks just like her!!It has beautiful blue eyes and red hair. She loves it!!The only thing I am worried about is that I have to watch her with the costume. Every thing goes to her mouth!!
__label__2,"Good Beginner Book: I found this book to be helpful as a way to learn a little about everything in Delphi. I realize that a book would have to be several thousand pages to cover all that Delphi does, so I knew this was a 'taste' of it. It was much better written than the documentation form Borland. I would recommend this book as a way to 'get going' with delphi. Sam's should have included the source code on disk/CD-ROM, but I found it at ftp://ftp.mcp.com/pub/sams/books/TYDELPHI2/tde2src.zip, and that helped"
__label__1,"NOT WORTH IT!: I did NOT like the ""new & improved"" Diaper Genie. First the button kept breaking off to open the thing. Second, you have to stick your hand deep in the pail - more than I wanted to for a diaper pail. Third, the cutter rarely worked. I had to use scissors more times. Forth, when I put the refills in, it never started off correctly. Finally, the odor control was aweful. Although, no matter what diaper disposal unit you use, the only way to completely control the odor is to empty it regularly and clean it. I was NOT impressed with this product at all - I would have given it zero stars if it was an option. I ended up going to buy another one, that was cheaper and works a lot better - no fuss at all."
__label__2,"Outstanding Work: I purchased this book due to the overwhelming number of posative reviews it recieved... and boy, I wasn't disappointed. Quite frankly, it's *best* book I've encountered on the subject of modeling low-mid poly figures for use in Games. The technique lessons therein are invaluable to someone new to the software... and veterans will pick up a few nifty things too.I find the best books to be those that will take the reader by the hand, and explicitly lead him/her through the entire life cycle of a 3D project... Paul Steed did a WONDERFUL job with this book!In reference to one of the negative reviews above: This book was not designed specifically to cater to only 3D Studio Max 3.0... I'm not exactly sure how he arrived at that conclusion. It sounds more like either his units are calibrated differently, or he made a misstep through the project. I encountered no such difficulties."
__label__1,"The Few Who Bothered/Shrugged: What absolute bull that 220 people gave this piece of dog feces of a movie could be voted 5 stars. Clearly, the sick little far right vermin that slimed through this earth clearly tried to affect the outcome of movie reviews. I really reluctantly saw this piece of trash and was offended on screen. It is unbearable to watch as a movie. Disastrous. And it's tired, cold, ""pull yourself up by your boot strings"" or ""only the strong survive"" in low level Darwinism. It is a piece of trash. It is not worth even watching the unwatchable trailer.Luckily, it was an unmitigated box office disaster. It did less than $500,000 in movie receipts. The joke was clearly on the infidels behind this crap."

__label__1,"Too bad it stinks, it is a nice idea: Form factor, rubber pads, screen, size, weight... all perfect for a handheld. The OS drove me to drink, then back to Palm. Why on earth you would release something so buggy and problem ridden is beyond me. Any Palm I have ever used has never missed alarms, appointments, or clock events... This beauty never would work. Task alarms - failed, Event alarms - failed, even soft resets, set an alarm on the stupid clock (never starting any apps) would fail. Get a Palm powered device if you want reliability... get a PocketPC if you want a game gadget that you can sell for a lot less than you paid! (same experience with iPaq 1910)"
__label__2,Best book for toddler products: Toddler bargains is a great resource book when it comes to buying toddler products. I was very eager to receive my copy and learn about double strollers. The information and advice given in the book helped my decide on the best and safest stroller for my family. I will also refer to it when I'm ready to buy a convertible car seat. The toy and potty seat reviews are also good.

__label__1,"Disappointing. Unconvincing. Self-imitation.: I've read and reread ""The Godfather"" and enjoyed it everytime. I'm sorry to say I found ""The Last Don"" weak andunconvincing. I even at times start to wonder if the Mafia lingo is real or if he's making it up. Early in the book, he says killing where the body is intended to be found are ""confirmations,"" ones where it is intended not to be found are ""communions."" Then, throughout the book, over and over, whenever a killing is contemplated someone says something about whether it's to be ""a communion or a confirmation."" Maybe we're to assume this is Clericuzio family language, not shared by other Mafia families? Reads like Puzo is imitating Richard Condon imitating Puzo."
__label__2,"The book queer theory should have made its ur-text...: Van Leer's book is everything we want from gay and lesbian (and queer) theory. Written in extremely lucid, beautifully crisp prose, Van Leer looks closely at how ""the closet"" could and did function in important ways in mid-20th c. America. He returns theory to the masses here--offering an analysis that is truly accessible to all readers, academic and non-academic alike. Moreover, he pays close attention to minority subcultures and their intersections; he is not solely interested in gay, white male specificity. In this respect alone, the book is completely novel and important--evidencing a respect for all minority populations existing within hegemony. A theoretical tour-de-force and a treat to read, ""The Queening of America"" is the book we all should have turned to in queer theory's nascent period. It's a shame it isn't read and cited more often."
__label__1,"42 lumens is WEAK: Maybe a few years ago this was a good idea.42 lumens is the LED manufacturer's spec for a 1-watt LED. This flashlight probably doesn't even put out 42 lumens, they are just pasting in the LED specification (which doesn't account for light loss due to reflectors, etc.). In reality, this is probably about 30 lumens.If you really need a good flashlight for ""professional"" use, pay more for a Surefire G2. It's twice as bright, and they publish accurate light output numbers based on end-product testing.If you just want a flashlight for occasional use and don't need anything brighter, there are currently a lot of other 1-watt flashlights which run off of 1 or 2 AA batteries. Lithium batteries are great when power consumption needs them, but this isn't the kind of light that needs it."
__label__1,"Do Not Buy!: Piece of junk. The ""glass"" (plastic) crystals warped and fell off both sides. Very difficult to re-zero. If you want a tool like this, go with one of the electronic ones, which cost no more than this one (like the Scalex mapwheel)."

__label__2,"Phenominal, enlightening, and scary: The end is near, that fact is certain. Through the book, Hagee unravels the mysteries of Daniel and parts of Revelation, taking nothing out of context, and remaining biblically sound. His writing is inspiring, yet scary for those who don't know the truth. From Daniel to Doomsday can be a great witnessing tool for skeptics, for it shows the unrefutable EXACTNESS that prophecy really displays. An excellent book, an excellent read, recommendable to pastors, teachers, christians and non-believers alike. It will challenge the thoughts and doctrines and presuppositions that anyone has. EXCELLENT!"
__label__1,Piece of Junk: I have the DGB-600BC model. I received it as a Christmas gift a year ago and have exchanged it 4 times. I loved it up until it quit working. It would only brew 1 to 2 cups at a time. Well we drink a lot of coffee in this house and I cannot devote and hour a day to making coffee and cleaning a machine.

Angry dissenters from Church doctrine attempt to show that the Church has reversed itself on key moral issues, but the methods used fall far below the minimum for theological scholarship.

We tried to return it but CC insisted on sending it out to have it repaired vs. giving our money back. The repair attempts were unsuccessful x2, with the technician finding no problems. We are now back to the drawing board and will have to purchase another player. It definitely won't be a Zenith!"
__label__1,"quaint: As PvR writes, this book is dated. By more than the 40 some years since publication; it has the flavor of a book from the early 1900's; the protestant missionary - tourist in a hundred exotic gardens whose names are mispelled; unsystematic; creationist. The funny tree the ""natives"" called tumbo, properly named for the German who ""discovered"" it and such wonders described in bubbles of enthusiasm for god's menagerie.And yet a quaint book for your bathroom, for a quick contemplative chuckle at peculiarities of nature and at our silly selves. Very like a whale!"

They seem to think that I'm trying to rip them off or something!From what I have read in the book, it seems pretty good and informative, but so far I've attempted finding coding examples for several specific problems using the index and haven't found any answers yet."

The pictures of the screen that you see online look like a normal laptop computer, with a screen full of colorful games. The pictures are very deceptive, though, because when you open it up, the screen has a picture over most of it, and the actual screen where the game appears is appx. a 2""x4"" window, with only black and white games.It's a cool toy, but don't expect it to actually be similar to a real computer."
__label__1,"unconvincing: seen many war movies and this is not one of the better ones. it is still watchable with a fairly original theme about bomb squads. the movie is slow at times and what kept my attention are the various bomb situations. character development was ok but i don't really feel like rooting for any of the main characters. the most convincing scene is the first few minutes with guy pearce.for me, this won't hold up to classics like 'das boot', 'braveheart', 'thin red line', 'platoon', 'last samurai', 'flags of our fathers', 'we were soldiers' etc"

Some of the blues stuff on here is OK, but there is quite a few fey pop songs on here that are a real drag. The biggest bummer of all, however, is the singer's habit of breaking into Robert Plant impersonations from time to time. If it's raw modern bluesy raunch you're after I'd suggest starting with a Gories album. Pass on this."
__label__1,"Horrible Movie: I am beyond words why so many people like this movie on ecom. From the morally vapid scenery of a tool looking for love in Los Angeles, Ashton Kutcher had no charisma and a pretty dumb character.Only thing i liked was Anne Heche, but she has been in better also. Guess if you are looking for a prototypical Cougar movie, this is just a movie. but it isn't a good one. it is pretty banal and offering not too much quality."
__label__1,my review: It was ok . Not great. I felt it left out a lot of adds that I remember from the 60s and 70s.
__label__1,"Most Boring Book on Record: This is certainly the most boring book of modern times. And worse, completely senseless.How is it that people keep buying her books? And of all the reviews ever written of this one, not one reviewermentions the name of the guy who died and left the heroine her fortune. Stanley Pearlman. Not one reviewer, nor the author, nor the heroine wonders why this Jewish eccentric and recluse has left all his money to relatives who are all Christians. As is the heroine."
__label__2,This thing rocks!: I bought this for my kitchen backsplash over the sink. Wow is all I can say! What a nice easy way to update the look of your kitchen while adding handy storage space. I use the utensil holder for spray oil...to keep it handy by the stove...commonly used spices...and it's really nice getting the paper towel holder off of the counter.You'll need a carbide tipped bit for installing the mounting studs on a tile surface. But once the holes were drilled...it went up in 10-minutes!
__label__1,"Brian's On the Mark: ""Last of the Dixie Heroes"" was a great read for most of the book, but went absolutely haywire in the last several chapters. After finishing it, I was glad that I had borrowed it from the library instead of paying for it. Perhaps Mr. Abrahams had something profoundly surreal in mind; if so, he missed the mark by a country mile. See Mr. English's reveiw for more details... I couldn't agree more."
__label__2,"Finally found Pokeno!!!: I love Pokeno and like many others have been looking for it for a long time. It finally came today. I can't wait to play Christmas day. The extended family gathers almost every weekend to play tonk but the younger kids could never join in. Also, we had to rotate because most did not like more than 5 players at one time. Now there is something everyone will be able to play...at the same time! I need to get my pennies ready..."
__label__1,Lame: This didn't do exactly what I expected. I assumed this would increase the aspect ratio of the camera- but in reality it simply added a magnifying glass to my lens. Which means I had to be zoomed in just to use the attachment.
__label__1,"move on: Contigo made the best mug I ever had... it was the contigo extreme prior to 2010. I still have it, it is a tank it doesnt leak. even if you drop it. I got 2 of these thinking it would be good to have some extra mugs for when i leave mine at work. This model is not even close!! to the quaity of the old mugs. in addition to that, the way the coffee comes out of the spout is certian to burn the heck out of your lip. My wife thought I was being fussy until she had the same thin happen. This is a lot of money for a mug you will only use twice. move on to something else."
__label__1,"Would be more useful without all the typographial errors.: This book looks like it would be very good, but starting on page 95 there is a font change, and this font change is accompanied by many typographical errors, replacing Es with null-set symbols, missing Os, and irregular spacing that makes the words difficult to read. When learning a new language, this is even more of a problem than it would be in a book in one's native language.It's a shame, because this seemed like it would be an otherwise very useful book."
__label__2,Before Five in a Row: What a wonderful book - so many great ideas!! My four year old boy - Loves it - We have enjoyed it very much!
__label__1,"Wrong info: You have eleven seasons, but Fishborne was only in 3, William Petersen was in 8 of them, and better that Fishborne. You need to get your correct info before submitting it."
__label__1,"Don't waste your money !: In my opinion - an absolute piece of junk. The handle kept pulling off the unit while in use, it took three charges and wouldn't recharge after that. I had to keep going over popcorn kernels several times before it picked up. What a waste of my time and money !"
__label__2,"A must for every Westie Lover's library!: The most indepth, comprehensive book about the West Highland White Terrier available today. This book is a must for the library of the breed lover. The historical lineage of the breed, as well as the sketches of those who've made an impact in the breed in the 20th century, is beyond compare. Ms. Gentry offered something for everyone from the pet lover to the most serious dog show owner. I appreciated the separate chapters that are written by experts in the fields of grooming, performance events, and health. You will find something on every page that will help you and your beloved Westie!"
__label__2,"expensive, but WORTH IT!: I love these socks! Yes, they are expensive, but they are SO WORTH IT! The thick cushion provides an extra layer of cushioning, useful for both pronators and supinators, and also helps keep the socks from shifting on your feet, reducing blisters. They are strong enough to reduce that dreaded ""big toenail hole"", but soft and comfy.I do hang them to dry, rather than use the dryer, but I have 8 or 9 pairs that are over 6 years old, so they wind up costing less in the long run than do cheaper socks."
__label__1,"disappointed....: should not even get one star, read all the reviews, made sure that the right product was ordered, and they still sent a knock off of what I specifically ordered, this is absolute crap, shame on ecom for deceiving the public and ripping people off."
__label__1,"Great story, terrible edition: I read this series a long time ago, and was very exited to finally see Kindle versions of the books, so I could re-read them.As many other reiewers have said, this edition needs a serious edit. The Kindle version is clearly an OCR scan of some printed edition, and the most basic of human edits would have caught all of the typos.The pubIsher really need sto fix this fundamental problem with the Kindle edition."
__label__2,"Worth $200: For the price, this is worth it. I work in many remote locations without TV or american TV. This product gives me TV wherever I am in the world, as long as I have internet. The picture quality is not great unless you have a really good internet connection on both ends, but it is better than no tv at all. I love the fact that there is no monthly fees. Sling media support was very helpful in helping me get everything set up, they did it remotely. Well worth the price."

__label__2,"A Natural Classic!: 'Endangered Species' was the first of Barr's books I'd ever read. The book was great! I loved how she worked in the turtles, so it didn't just evolve around the airplane crash. I also like how Barr semi-explained Anna's history, so I wouldn't be lost."
__label__2,"Excellent Book!!!!: I Have read alot of books over the years about both the Nephilim and the Apocalypse. This book is by far my favorite! It's very well written book and fasinating subject matter!If your thinking of buying this book please don't hesitate,you will not be sorry!!!I am really looking forward to reading any future books written by Patrick Heron!!!"
__label__2,"Nice unit: Nice unit, good screen, great battery life, good barometric elevation sensor. The only thing I would change is to have it come with auto-routing maps (city navigator) rather than the auto-routing base map (horrible). Even a straight goto line would be preferable sometimes. Other than that, it can take 2G memory cards, which is a LOT of mapping; I load metroguide maps, topo maps to exhaustion (mine). Floats, supposedly, but I haven't had the..luck..to verify this.Satellite reception is tremendously good, a point I can't overemphasize. I haven't tried it under dense canopy, but in the urban condo canyons & whatnot it has always gotten great coverage."
__label__2,"NOT the wrong title: This film is not ""Z"", another great film by Costa Gravas. ""Z"" takes place in Greece, and ""State of Siege"" takes place in Latin America. Both films are highly political. I believe that ""Z"" is the superior film, but Costa-Gravas is a master. I hope it will be re-released soon."
__label__1,Leaks on all ends: I have been using the previous-design water faucet purifier and it started to leak on all ends after a year. i thought it was a design flaw and gave it a second try with the newly designed 2-stage faucet filter. What a piece of crap! It leaks at the faucet and at the clip-on right from the start! who had this cheap idea? Their Chinese suppliers? They are ruining the P&G brand name with this crap! I buy a Brita now and return the Pur.
__label__2,Awesome 3D Movie: Awesome Movie! I know it doesn't go with history but has a lot of ties ins to it. Must See!
__label__1,uncomfortable: I tried to go for the best and i still ended up with sores on my bumbum.There are much more comfortable seats in your local super center. Make sure you test the quality and the material before you buy those. Now it just sits there looking at me reminding me of my mistake. dont buy
__label__2,"quality american craftsmanship????: a little dissapointing for the price. as the saying goes , they dont make em like they use to.first of all , like other reviews the grips tend to wiggle , I solved that problem with a little stick-em. second , like the other reviews , the paint by the serial numbers is flaking, wich lets the brass show thru. i am still satisfied with the gun. however i will carefully choose my ""made in the U.S.A "" products from now on. update 2012. after firing 1000 plus pellets thru this gun, it still has as much power as it did when new, and the sights are still right on. i have taken a fair number of squirrels with this. i now give it 4 stars instead of three."
__label__1,"disappointed: Normally I would love the toy for my son, but when I recieved it, it was BROKEN! The toy didn't read the letters correctly or some, not at all!"
__label__1,"It's no wonder this rapper is ""lonely""!: Well in may I had a school dance, so I sat down with a bunch of chicks to take a break from dancing (I was pretty sweaty, just in the face area) and so alluva sudden, I hear this voice that sounds like some guy trying smoke pot and snort coke at the same time, coming out of the speaker! He appears to be saying ""Lonely! Hi Mr. Lonely! I've not nobody, I'm on my own!""So then I laugh my ass off, thinking it was the DJ trying to [...] around with us.So then I ask the chick on my left, ""What the f*** is this?!""She goes, ""It's Akon and his HORRIBLE stinker, Lonely.""I Laugh. I go, ""It sounds nothing like AKON at all!""This guy just plain SUCKS. He is ripping of K-Os, and he just adds these lame lyrics and stupid beats into his song. Yet another lame MTV ripoff artist.Oh well. This sucks, same goes for pretty much every rapper (except K-Os) out there."
__label__2,"WOW: When I first started the book, I thought it was boring, but I was determined to finish it. As I got through it...it became so interesting that I couldn't put it down. The only part that was kind of cheesy was how fast Sammy forgave his father. It happened a little too suddenly. But after I was done....I wanted to read it all over again. I can't wait to read Dr. Spark's other books. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old."
__label__1,Misleading photo: Why do they show a single pair of drumsticks when the photo shows two pairs? Buy something else.
__label__1,Good at first but not for long: This armband worked great for a couple months but then the elastic started breaking down. It's not made for small arms in the first place so after a while it got really loose and not too comfortable. Also it's open on the front and top so no working out in the rain. :(
__label__1,"Gary Pucket and the Vocal Gap: dont watch this, his voice is gone from all the bongs and partying of the 60's. Listen to the CD greatest hits and enjoy the memory of summer love!!"
__label__1,"flawed concept: Here's my problem: While I do think we create a lot of our own problems in this life, I don't think every single situation in life is one of our own creation. To me, saying that we create everything in our lives through our ""thought vibrations"" is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly. Our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs? Really? So, for example, the Jews killed during the Holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy? Granted, what the author is really talking about is MUCH smaller situations in our everyday lives, ones we can control. But still, this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me. Also, I was looking for more concrete ""how to"" information, which I found a bit lacking in this book. I know the author was going for simplicity, but I found the illustrations and exercises a bit too simplistic and not terribly helpful."
__label__1,"Good Bible, but.....: I wish I had known before that there are a few pictures that were drawn inappropriately. One of Eve, of course--and one of Potipher's Wife, looking seductive, with cleavage showing and all. The other is of Mary, dressed in a low-cut, sleveless shirt. I don't think these pictures are appropriate for a children's Bible. The rest of the content is good and speaks to young children right at their level--but I don't like having to hide the above mentioned pictures from my 3 young boys."
__label__1,"One Question: I have just one question... How much did the FBI pay her to write this drivel? (There really should be a Zero Stars rating choice for this one). Do yourself a favor and read ""Altered Evidence"" by James Sanders (available on ecom.com). The truth shall set you free...but Jim Kallstrom & the FBI will only treat you like mushrooms (they'll keep you in the dark and feed you ""fertilizer"" all day long)."

__label__2,Nice patterns but you must know tatting techniques: This is a nice book and has nice patterns. But you must know how to read tatting diagrams and you must know split ring tatting among other techiques. This is not a book for a beginning tatter.For experienced tatters a must if you can get a copy that isn't to expensive.I got lucky when I found mine for a lower price. I recommend this tatting book for experienced tatters only.
__label__2,"Wonderous Wilburys: If you are the least bit a Traveling Wilburys fan, this is a must have. The music is fantastic . . . the DVD is excellent. There was a lot of forethought put into this project. You will not be sorry at all if you purchase this package."
__label__1,"Fluke? I sure hope so.: Fist let me say that I have used Tena for a long time. I have usually been very satisfied with it.The last two purchases were not that great. In the first one, 2 of the pads were not usable as they split as soon as you took the tape off.On the next package, there were 6 of the same thing. I am hoping that this is not a regular thing as these pads are expensive and should be intact.Hopefully this will be fixed soon and I can upgrade this review because I really like this product."
__label__1,"Huge Disappointment: This product was a huge disappointment to me. These trimmers were supposed to last much longer than regular line, but they didn't for me. They were easy to install, but their life was no better than a comparable diameter line I have used for years."
__label__2,"Excelent but highly technical: If you want to learn about the physics of nuclear explosions this is the ultimate source. It doesn't discuss how to make a bomb but does explain how one works and how it effects the surrounding world. Each section has a general discussion followed by a more technical discussion of the same material. At its least technical level you'll still need to understand physics and math at an advanced high school level. At its most technical it is written for degreed professionals.Even though the text is very dry and academic, I found it quite riveting because of the enormity of what was being described. The nuclear weapons effects calculator in the pocket of the back cover is pretty neat once you figure it out."
__label__1,"couldn't get through it: this story was so slow. I eventually put it down and didnt finish reading it(and I never do that). The author uses words beautifully, if only she could write a story that went somewhere and kept the reader interested."
__label__1,"feel like an old Lincoln Towncar!: These shocks are horrible! I thought I would try these from a well known manufacturer (KYB)to replace worn out Rancho 5000's. God, what a mistake! The body roll I experienced was WORSE than the worn out Rancho's! Brake dive was the same! I was so disappointed with these shocks that I ended up taking them off and purchasing a new set of Rancho 5000's. These may ride like OEM for some vehicles, but we all know OEM is not always a good thing. If you want your vehicle to ride like an '88 Lincoln Towncar, then these are a cheap option. But if you want something with stability and a little more firmness (but not harsh) spend the little extra for the Rancho's or ProComp's. I gave these 2 stars because they were not defective, looked like a quality product, and yes are a monotube design."
__label__1,Faulty design: This product failed in less than one year. It appears to be the rechargeable battery and is clearly a design or quality defect. It should be removed from the market.
__label__2,"Humorous tales of growing up in Appalachia: This is a book about growing up in the Appalachian Mountains, from the perspective of an adoloscent boy. The varied stories evoke emotions of anger, sadness and humor. It contains tales of witchcraft, murder, life and death. You will sense the deep love and respect that the writer has for his mother.There is a sense that you are sitting with the writer while he recounts many stories (whether real or imagined) of his coming of age.The book is not intended for children, but is well deserving of your time.I recommend this book."
__label__2,WOW. WOW. WOW !!!: This is an absolute gorgeous book. This is something you keep on the shelf for the rest of your life and dust it off when you give it to a child or grandchild. Quality all around. Take care of this one. There won't be many books like this as we move forward in the digital era.
__label__1,Not Made Like They Used To Be: My family has owned this model of waffle maker for about as long as Black and Decker has been making them. I got one as recently as my 4 years ago and it worked great and is still working great. Unfortunately when we bought a vacation home and I purchased one we were very disappointed. When set at normal waffle levels it barely cooks the waffle. Even when you raise the heat to the top of the waffle setting it cooks unevenly. The front waffles are perfect or even over cooked and the back ones are soft and still raw. I would love to tell you that this is just an individual lemon but it's not. Over the last 8 months I have purchased and returned 6 of these waffle makers and all had the same problem with some being worse than others but all being bad. My family loves waffles (I mean really loves waffles!!) and we are so upset that Black and Decker has obviously decreased their quality and turned an excellent product into a piece of junk.
__label__1,"this is sherlock holmes?: Buffalo Bill? Annie Oakley? Frank Butler? Moriarty back from the dead? A Time Machine? Werewolves? Doctor Jekyll? A 'half brother' unrecognizable as Moriarty himsef to the world's Best Consulting Detective? Holmes in Love? Wild West accents straight out of a cartoon? Twisted contrived plots.Holy Moly there Batman.....Actually Batman mysteriously didn't appear above the rooftops of London but who would have been surprised.page 135; 'Believe it or not Watson, I thing I'm beginning to understand a few things...' Well, he is Holmes and I am not...Like Watson I have to ask; 'Do you have any idea what is really going on?'To the true Holmes fan this has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes except to arbitrarily burden the main character with that name. What a shame for the reader and at $17. plus shipping and handling.Skip this book and author."
__label__2,"Come on....it wasn't that bad.: The movie wasn't as horrible as some make it out to be. It surely wasn't ""the worst vampire movie ever"". Jon Bon Jovi didn't suck in the roll either."
__label__1,"not quite there: This book is just too long. If it were condensed to sub-100 pages it might be worthwhile as it contains some interesting ideas. Unfortunately most of the examples begin with ""Cisco decided to.."", ""At Cisco we..., ""The Cisco method of..."" ......you get the idea. The authors cite ""Good to Great"" which is a real contrast, because the Collins team examines a wide variety of companies and industries rather than simply concentrating on Cisco. The book is also packed with graphics that -- let's face it folks -- are simply meaningless. I do not understand the reason for the other glowing reviews. Mediocre ""at best""."
__label__1,a little disappointed: i'm a little disappointed from the book. i'm a ZZ fan but the biography part of the book is short and not so interesting. most of the book is photos and explanations about cars and guitars which i didn't find interesting. i'm looking for a book with more biographic information about the texas trio.
__label__2,"Best help for older dogs I've found: I've tried several different medications with glucosamine and MSM and this one has by far the most positive result with our 10 year old lab mix. Prior to giving him these twice a day, he would have trouble rising from a sitting or laying position, was unable to jump up onto the bed without help, was generally cranky because he hurt all the time and often would avoid stairs. After about 2 weeks of taking these regularly, he's very mobile, wrestles with the other dogs, runs around the yard and jumps up on the bed without effort.The only con I have with it is that it only comes in liver flavor and my freak-of-nature dog does not like liver. A variety in chicken or peanut butter flavor would be nice."
__label__2,"A great reference guide for any Anime or Manga otaku ( fan ): This is not your everyday daily pose book. First of all; Eguchi's reference guides are hard to find, second is the fact that this is an import from Japan. Every pose is shot in a twelve frame 360 degree cycle to give you the dimension of the pose. If you have the desire to draw Anime or real life in the view of a shonen ( Japanese for male )this is the book for you."
__label__1,This is Trash.....: This album is garbage.... Just a pile of junk. Why did they put out this? It sounds like a bunch of trash. Metallica is way past its prime... and its going to be tough for them to get back in a groove.
__label__1,Yuck!: My 18 month old loves all the Baby E stuff. My son loves the puppets and the pictures of real objects like peas and oranges.He hates the clowns and crayons! The animated parts are awful. Why did they change a perfect format?
__label__1,"Terrible.: I won't talk about the paganini, as I already reviewed that album (and it was awful). As for the rest of the works on this disk, anyone who knows anything about classical music or anything about the fundamentals of guitar playing will quickly realize that Fisk falls embarrassingly short on so many levels it's ridiculous. There are certain standards of acceptable interpretation, rhythmic accuracy, cleanliness (there are MISTAKES on this CD!!), and tone quality, all of which Fisk grossly fails to meet. The unfortunate thing is that the guitar community as a whole doesn't seem to care about these things. If Fisk played any other instrument, he would not have a career. If you want to hear these pieces played well, I suggest you try David Russell, Manuel Barrueco, John Williams, Jason Vieaux, Pepe Romero, or Paul Galbraith. The difference between these players and Fisk is obvious."
__label__1,"It's an accident alright: Reading this tale of a pathetic, dysfunctional woman and her stupid, tiresome life feels like rubbernecking a multiple car accident in which no one was wearing a seat belt. The ""heroine,"" Lily, is clueless almost to the point of retardation, and her family and friends are two dimensional if they're lucky. It is impossible to suspend disbelief to the extent required to believe in one single exchange of dialogue or one single thought ascribed to any of these absurd characters. The only vaguely redeeming things about this irritating book are a couple of snappy oneliners and a Martha Stewart spoof, but that's just not enough to make it worth the price of admission, or even the time it would take to borrow it from the library...."
__label__2,"light and frothy fun: i just had to respond to the negative reviews to plum Sykes's book. i think its absolutely hillarious - i read it in a single sitting. No, its not quantum physics but it doesn't pretend to be. It is, however, 100% entertaining and i laughed out loud throughout. Get over yourselves, haters, and set yourselves a make-out challenge!"
__label__2,"Fabulous!: This is definately one of the best gay novels out there. I appreciated it as a very open look at the partying gay lifestyle of the 70's. The best way to describe it would be Tales of the City meets Queer as Folk. I give it 4 stars because it does revolve around the sex, drugs, and disco lifestyle that alot of people don't find particularly positive. And also the characters really are a sea of dancing faces with no real depth. But if you can get past that and see the book for the slice of brutally honest gay history that it is and appreciate the lives that were lived that way it really is a fabulous, fabulous book."
__label__1,"game is worth more as a frisbee.: When i bought this game i thought it would be like gotham racing but with more of a variety, but i was wrong, it has less variety. No damage on the cars and the lighting sucks. Almost every level i have been to(which is as far as the 4th level on underground mode because i just gave up cause it was to damn long and hard.) is in the night which is anouying. Also you cant get a lead on the computer they are always right there. The cops are also anouying especailly when they pull you over right near the end of the level. Also the computer can knock you into oblivion but you cant even knock them off course, and characters are anouying, they say the same thing every time. This game isnt even worth renting and definantly do not! i repeat, do not buy test drive! Its an exspensive frisbee. In fact i am turning it into funco land."
__label__1,Huh?: I dont thnk the price matches the productand it was not soft as silkit was not what I expected.. it was to transparent and not what it looks like on the webi did not like itI tought it was going to be more like poleyster or Lycra
__label__2,"A writer I can relate to: Now here is a well written beliveble story anyone would enjoy.The synopsis of the book as already been well written by the other reviewers, so I will not repeat it here.This book as I mentioned before is VERY VERY well written and researched for it's Genre, the plot is excellent, the dialect and even some humor was excellently written.The only reason why I cannot give it a full five star inspite of my rave reviews is very personal.I have to be able to fall in love with the Hero of anybook I read. I could not in good faith give this Hero my heart.I'm much into Alpha male, take charge, don't bow to anyone type of characters and the Hero in this book was not such a man.Other than that minor personal preference this book is an awesome read."

__label__2,"The true story, with little fictionalization: The career and life of singer-actress Jane Froman was beautifully written for the screen by Lamar Trotti, with a great deal of Miss Froman's input. She was also portrayed most winningly by Academy Award nominee Susan Hayward (she won the Best Actress Oscar a few years later for ""I Want to Live""), who flawlessly lip-synched to Miss Froman's own gorgeous voice on the soundtrack.I never get tired of watching this film. It makes me realize just how small my problems are compared to those of really courageous people like Jane Froman. With faith, courage and strength, she endured what seems beyond human endurance. She had her ups and downs, but consistently got up to fight again and again. I marvel at how the film stuck very close to facts, up to the time the film was made. Even small details were covered in the dialogue.One of my all-time favorite films, with one of my all-time favorite actresses, portraying a lady who lived her life with grace and gallantry!"
__label__1,"Rare, recently produced, poorly done SW comic.: This is a review of the Dark horse comic ISBN 1569716234 published January, 2002 Printed in Canada, story by Ron Marz, Art by Tom Fowler. I have put this book on the SW timeline at -27.1 before NH.This comic features some of the worst artwork I have seen in a star wars based comic produced in the last several years. This story features Jango, Zam and a cameo from Boba. The story is a 3 but the artwork is a 2.I buy these comics for 2 reasons. First is so I can read them with my son. The second is that Lucas licensing sometimes allows Dark Horse to make an important contribution of fact and context to the SW expanded universe. One also buys a comic for its artwork. Because this one fails based on its art, I rounded down to 2 stars."
__label__1,One of the worst that I've heard: The singing in this album is one of the worst that I've heard. Russell Watson's smallish voice and ill-formed technique can in no way do justice to the music. His lack of interpretative talent is also an obstacle when he trys to convey any feeling to the listener. A totallyl insipid recording.

I saw it in an air conditioned theater. Thats all.Avoid this, its dull, not funny, the plot is predictable and part of you regrets watching it unfold, thats your soul try to commit suicide. What an incredibly horrible horrible film."
__label__1,"Not to my taste: After spending much time trying to pull all the plots and characters together, I have given up on this book. I find it too disjointed and hard to follow. I try to find books to excape the problems of the world and entertain me. This one missed the mark for me."
__label__2,"The Helmsman returns to defend in a new starship: The fourth book in the Helmsman series finds Wilf Brim as skipper of his own starship based on the racing hull of the last book. Due to politics, the crew ends up as Mercenaries on the far flung Fluvannian star system. Bewitched by his old love Margot, Brim sires a child and battles the League.Baldwin continues the saga of the Helmsman using his deft touch of technical and piloting jargon to carry the reader through the plot. Dedicated fans of the Helmsman will enjoy the read. New readers should start with'The Helmsman' or 'Galactic Convoy' or many of the plot interplays are lost.A fine read, but clearly the middle book of a series with all of the faults and traits such a books has. Some mature descriptions of Brim's love life"
__label__2,These guys can Swing !!!!: What a band!!! This group presents some Big Band and Swing standards in a whole new light: fresh and exciting!!! This CD is a must for any serious swing fan!!!
__label__1,"The World's Most Disappointing Tag Teams DVD: When I first heard about this I couldn't wait for it to be released. I expected a format like WWE's Greatest Wrestling Superstars of the 80's, but once I saw DX on the cover then I had a feeling the DVD wasn't going to deliver. DX is one of several teams thrown together purely for entertainment value and nothing else. There were quite a few teams featured that I would never consider great (i.e. The Smokin' Gunns).The bios were quick clips (with no real background or history) and then a match featuring the team. I hate this format. WWE needs to lay out the DVD like they did with the ""80's superstars"" - bios & history, then put the matches in the extras menu.It's too bad that the WWE seems more interested in just churning out DVDs expecting that fans will just buy them rather than putting out quality compilations. I've become a lot more selective due to the past few offerings."
__label__1,not real happy with the suction: The convenience is wonderful but the suction level is not great. I guess you really need to go with a corded vacuum to get great suction.
__label__2,Bad Romance - code of honor: This CD rocks - female vocals are great! All eleven tracks are quality work!! Joanna Dean hits the notes. You will be glad to have this out of print CD in your collection.
__label__2,"First album: Excellent songs and music and this is the firts album, so I think she will be an excellent singer"
__label__2,"Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Widescreen Edition): I mistakenly purchased Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End locally, not knowing it was the third installment in the series. I enjoyed it so much I decided to purchase the first two. If you like swashbuckling adventure mixed with the legend of Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman, you'll like these movies. I was thoroughly entertained. Excellent cast."
__label__2,"Good buy: Sturdy, works well, cheap. Long as hell. Don't Buy 50+$ ones from best buy works just as well and you'll save some mean cash"
__label__2,"100 girls: This unknown movie is a, ""gem."" It has a lot of truths between how each gender perceives the other. It may not have played out in your local theater, but it is worth watching when bored. Similar movies within its class would be a, ""boy girl thing"" and, ""the cutting edge."" Truly a fun movie to see with your better (or worse) half."
__label__2,"A exellent review on The sims vacation!: The sims vacation looks an exellent game. I have got all the The sims games(The sims, livin it up, houseparty + hotdate) and this one must beat them all. With brand new things to do it sounds so exiting that I will definately buy a copy of it! All The sims games are very good and addictive too and Maxis should be very proud to bring out such a popular game! My sims are in need of a good break anyway! WELL DONE MAXIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__2,"Great resource: Although this is a great resource it is a bit bulky. Even so, I wouldn't want less material. I appreciate the reproducible sheets so much. I don't have a lot to say that others haven't already said. I do want to recommend another set of books to use directly with the children. It is four Dolch sight word books by Betsy B. Lee. These don't look that much like little kid books and they are even used in middle school and the lower grades. Look up the author's name at ecom."
__label__1,"Do not buy: I would discourage people from buying this book if they are interested in learning Vietnamese. Vietnamese pronunciation is not readily apparent from the spelling system and the book gives little help in explaining the sound system of Vietnamese. Without this, it is almost impossible to learn spoken Vietnamese from the tapes, since most of the sentences in the book are not recorded on the tapes. The Vietnamese book in the ""Teach Yourself"" series looked more plausible for self- instruction."
__label__2,"Great Introduction: IMHO The reason the ""for dummies"" brand has been successfull aside from the catchy name, is the actual content and material of the books themselves.This book has been a great read for some one like myself that already had an idea of what investing entails, but that does not preclude total beginners with no idea from gaining an immense amount of great information from this book.It is written in plain language and is a great place for a beginner to start his journey."
__label__2,"Looking forward to the Reunion CD: This album was a good effort, but not indicative of Mark See's best work. I was fortunate enough to see him back in the 80's when he played in the Myx and Human Nature. The drummer especially was awesome in these groups and the chemistry in the band was awesome!I think that this CD is a good primer for his talents but the key to the best future efforts of Mark See rest in his past."
__label__2,"Celluloid Black and White Heaven: Watch this film and you are immediately one up!! Unlike poor Palfrey played by the wonderfully unassuming Ian Carmichael. If you are feeling down and want a story with a happy ending, thats romantic without being too sloppy, funny without being crudely slapstick and innocent but with a gleam in its eye, then this is the film for you. As ever the performances of Alastair Simm, Terry Thomas, Carmichael and the rest of the cast end up overshadowing the never-the-less delightful plot. Actors of this calibre from this period always seem not to be acting if you know what I mean. This gives the viewer such empathy with their plight that one becomes engrossed totally, squirming with Palfreys plight and chuckling at the Professors ploys and cheering when the baddy gets his and Palfrey gets the beautiful April.Please watch this fim but try not to take the wrong message from it! Remember that finally Palfrey has to open his heart to get the girl. Enjoy."
__label__2,A very good product: I actually eventually discarded the international adapters because I never travel outside the US. It was so reasonable I just use it as an extra charger.
__label__2,"Stravaganza, City Of Masks: This is a wonderful book! The author intertwined many plots and sub-plots that all pop up suddenly somewhere to add suspense to the book. Throughout the book, characters surprise you with links to other characters and sudden decisions. This book has everything from making lace to assasinatiion plans. I won't tell you more because it might ruin the ecsquisite suspense and twisted plots that make up this book."
__label__2,"Comments on Billy Health - Suvivor of Little Big Horn: Although not an historian of the Battle of Little Bighorn, the author does offer compelling evidence that there was a survivor. In addition, the book provides interesting information on the Pa. coal region, Custer, Little Bighorn, etc. The information appears to have been thoroughly researched and well written. It's very evident that the writer believes that Billy Heath is, in fact, the sole suvivor of the Battle of Little Bighorn."
__label__1,"Disappointing: I knew that I wasn't going to like this book after 2 minutes of flipping through the photos. They are mediocre at best. Not one inspiring shot in the entire book! And the advice is useless.Skip this book and buy ""The Simple Secret to Better Painting: How to Immediately Improve Your Work With the Golden Rule of Design"" by Greg Albert. And don't be fooled by the word ""painting"" in the title. This is a book about composition and it will help make you a better photographer."
__label__2,"great quality: This is a great product the only ""problem"" we have had is: attaching the wall mount to the wall and still having a centered television - it's impossible to center the television because of where our studs are in the wall. Our preferred method of ""fixing"" the problem was to have a longer wall plate constructed (special) - so that we have room to actually slide the television into the center."
__label__1,"Mediocre performances of great music - get the vinal: Our family fell in love with the Frank Sinatra / Marlon Brando movie of Guys and Dolls. Imagine our delight when we found the CD. Imagine the looks around the dinner table when even our four-year-old said ""This isn't as good as the movie, is it?"" In fact, after hearing the movie, it's almost unlistenable. We did unearth an old scratchy copy of the vinal record from the 1950's, and though it's not as good as the movie, it's very close, and it blows the doors off of the CD."
__label__1,"Wait until bugs are ironed out!!!: This latest expansion to EQ is nothing but trouble. Go check out the Everquest message boards (...)The game has been down for two days now awaiting fixes for this newest expansion. Not to mention in order to SEE any of this expansion Sony suggests you have 512MB RAM and a 64MB Video card, but only a select few video cards will work!Customer service is non-existant, spend your money on something else."
__label__1,The book series is marvolous but I didn't realize I was buying an abridged copy and too much was left out.: Vince Flynn is a very detailed writer and has made Mitch Rapp bigger than life. Abridging the reading made the book very mundain and I felt I needed the full copy. I also would have loved to download it to my Kindle Fire rather than buy discs because the chance of getting a bad disc when buying used copies is very likely and disc 3 didn't work in my audio book.
__label__1,"Did we see the same movie?: This movie is MUCH worse than the other reviews say it is. It is so stupid and so phony and so irritating - and the music is so annoying and overbearing - that I wanted to start screaming and write my OWN suicide note just to get away from it.Maybe you have to be Japanese or a ten year old girl to appreciate it, but whatever it takes I don't have. I hated it."
__label__1,"A movie about cheating without the cheater: I do not like gimmicks. Here is a movie where the main plot is about a cheating husband. However, the dude never appears. It is a cute little gimmick but it destroys all of the drama. The acting is very good, the cast is all-star but the net effect is boredom. The musical score is basically non-existent. Whatever you do, do not buy this movie without renting it first. I rented it at our neighborhood supermarket for a dollar. That is all it is worth."
__label__1,"Be ready to go to sleep: The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, fight scenes look like your grandma choreographed them. It's every bad action cliche wrapped up in one movie."
__label__1,"dissatisfied: I was shipped half of the soundtrack to Evita. This is a 2 disc set and I received only 1 disc, the first act. I e-mailed this company with no response. I am extremely disappointed in this company."
__label__1,"Not so helpful: I did not find this book to be very helpful. I was looking for specific information about the etiquette for hosting a rehearsal dinner, my expected contributions for the wedding etc. etc. I did not find it in this book. Consequently, I will head to the library to get the information I need."
__label__1,Good thing it's short!: Quarantine was a waste of time. I plowed through to the end but only because it was short and I kept thinking it was going to get better. Or at least it would have some trick ending. It didn't. Save your money.
__label__1,Terrible experience: You shipped the wrong product to me (2 times). Your description of the product was completely different than what you shipped. Ultimately I had to return both products and order the product through Walmart. Walmart shipped the right product in less than 4 days.
__label__2,"MENNA: This book takes you on a journey through the struggles, terrors, and triumphs that Meena and RAWA have gone through. In just under 300 pages you are given an amazing prospective of Meena's life, courage, and beliefs. I truly believe this book could be a key point in demolishing ignorant wide spread opinions about the innocent people, especially women, in the Middle East in our countries time of crisis."

__label__2,"My favorite 'go-to' guide: This is such a wonderful resourse! I have it on hand at all times for when 'something's just not quite right' with one of my doggies. As has been mentioned, it contains a chapter for every part of your pet. Excessive sratching?: Chapter six has almost 20 pages devoted to hair and skin disorders. Chapter nine lists over twenty pages concerning 'spine, limbs, and paws. And on and on...it literally covers every square inch of your pet. It also contains a handy ""Symptoms Quickfinder"" chart, and and a great ""list of recommended dosages"" chart, that gives you dosages for everything from aspirin to Zinc. I could go on and on, but I guarantee, you will never be disappointed you purchased this book!"
__label__2,Prompt: Received this book promptly and received it in the condition as mentioned. Thanks for your business.
__label__1,Did they test the recipes?: Not-Like-Mom's Meat Loaf was very good although a little too moist. Oakland-Style Barbecue Sauce was a loser - a waste of good ingredients as well as time. Am now skeptical of the rest of the book.
__label__1,"The Universe and Multiple Reality, by M R Franks: It deseves one star, at the most, compared to other books published on the same subject."

__label__1,"Razor Pocket Mod not as Advertised: After buying two razor scooters for Christmas, I am very disappointed in the end result. The battery life on one pocket mod is only 5 minutes and then it putters out. Apparently, this is a problem for Razor as they have easily found information on their website. Why don't they send out a quality product to begin with rather than having customers tell excited kids, ""Sorry, we'll have to get another battery because this one is broken."" This is a poor way to run a a business!"
__label__2,Handy to have around: This product is handy to have in case of a flat tire.Sure saves changing the tire in the hot summer.
__label__1,"not the best: I have on old Borner V-Slicer that i was ready to replace with something more streamlined. I liked the way the OXO stores the blades onboard. I liked the dial feature. I really wanted to like this slicer. I was sure that the negative reviews were due to the inexperience of those using this product. (Using a mandoline takes practice.) I needed to chop four onions today. I figured that was a good way to test the slicer. After mangling and mutilating the first three, I switched to my old Borner V-slicer for the last onion. It was like slicing through butter after using the OXO. I packed up the OXO which will be returned tomorrow."
__label__1,Spyware and bullying install tactics: I purposely keep my PCs away from the internet. You can get viruses even if you have a good virus protection package. I don't want my tax information to be hacked.This package has spyware ...in it and also requires an intrusive internet installation step.Boo and hiss.This is the last time I buy Turbotax (I've had it since 1999)
__label__1,"Book not in condition stated: Description says book was in good condition but when I received it, the back of the book was ripped. Book also look worn out. Was generally disapointed with my purchase from buyer. Buyer should be more descriotive of item sold in the future."
__label__2,"Baby Wise: I loved the first Baby Wise book and the 2nd is also just as helpful. Everyone tells me I have such a good baby and that I'm so lucky. I tell them it's not luck but, Baby Wise. I tell all my friends and family who are pregnant or have children about these books. They are so wonderful and based on Christian teachings which I think is so important. I am a pediatric emergency nurse and I see so many children that are demand fed and have no routine (as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends) in there lives and these parents are usually stressed out and have fussy babies. I recommend Baby Wise to them."
__label__2,Dragon Lords: Of all the books I own of Michelle this series is my all time favorite! Once again Michelle outdid her self in the theme and writing of these books.I have a area just for her books and this is the best place to start if you have never read her books. Once you read the first book you will be totally hooks on them and want to read more of her books !
__label__2,SPOOKY but awesome!!!!!: I love the book it's so interesting and SPOOKY I LOVE SPOOKY stories!!!!! Read it I love baby sitters club books
__label__2,"Excellent!: The book was in excellent condition, the edition restored some errors that were in previous editions. I have been lugging it around everywhere and it's still excellent. The book itself is one of those books that you can read many times over and still find new, and fresh things to wonder at. I read it once a year and as I change the book changes too, as I understand more and more of the text. As a student studying literature at Uni at the moment, the message that can be found in it is timeless and enduring; but that message is for the reader alone to find."
__label__2,"LSU Garden Gnome: Love it! Another gift for my boss the consumate Tiger fan. It is sitting on his breakfast bar in his house and his kids love it. I cannot wait to get one for my husband, but we will put ours in the garden where it belongs. I just wish it was a little taller/bigger."
__label__1,"Not a great running shoe: I had never worn Saucony so when they were recommended, I decided to try. I ran on the store's treadmill and they felt fine, but I really should have taken the time to run longer.They boast that there is cushion, but there isn't enough cushion (or the shoe breaks down REALLY fast). My feet ached after I ran only about 20 miles in these shoes (I run about 3 miles at a time). The toe box is big and too roomy for me.My advice? Keep a journal on your activity and what your feet felt like during and after and maybe even how they feel the next day. Go to a store that knows running shoes and take your time deciding. Hoping for better luck next time."
__label__1,as expected: this is a good quality of paper for the printing i needed. i would purchase again and this item did arrive on time.
__label__2,Love it!: I used to have a starbucks coffee grinder and this one is definitely much better. I love the fact that I can just push one button and walk away. I love the different settings so that I can adjust the grind (in case I want it stronger or weaker). I would definitely recommend this item...and if mine ever breaks I will definitely be ordering the same one again!!!
__label__2,"A Fount of Knowledge that Needs a Little Tweek...: This reference is an excellent source of information in regards to management systems, feeds & feeding, breeding, production, etc. What I find lacking is how little effort seemed to go into the breed illustrations. Rabbits depicted are poorly posed and therefore make a very unsatisfactory representation of the breeds' description. If you can get past that little bump, the book - for its wealth of knowledge is an excellent resource for rabbit breeders or those considering embarking on that adventure."
__label__1,They sent me product that was past its expiration date: I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a New Mexican living elsewhere who loves red and green chile. What I got was something that was probably a delicious product but it was PAST the expiration date listed on the jar. I contacted them and never heard back. It was like they took my $30+ and didn't give a flying fig what I got for it. VERY disappointing. If they had done right by me I probably would have ordered regularly. I do not recommend this company. They do not appear to be honest or care about quality or customer service.
__label__2,"FIRST MP3: The screen is very nice and easy to view, even in bright sunlight. I was able to load songs with no trouble, and sound quality is pretty good. Only negative is that you must use a USB hookup to charge it."
__label__2,"A Pretty Good Horror/Comedy: This movie has a lot in it that I usually despise, like cliched plot, almost non-existent actors, and desert dwelling psychos. How many times have we seen that particular movie. However, Steve Taylor created a movie that really worked for me, even though it had so many of the things that I hate. The part that worked best for me were the characters in the van. They were some of the most obnoxious people I'd seen in a while in a movie and I found myself rooting for the desert psychos. This movie really held my interest and kept me laughing, even while the blood was spilling. It's definitely worth the $10."
__label__1,"Read Ovid instead.: This book is self-indulgent tripe ... there's a fine line between the wonderful tradition of rewriting and reinterpreting previously-told stories (see Ann Carson's Autobiography of Red for an absolutely glittering example) and just retelling. In this case, the story of Cineras and Myrra is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses and spun out in excruciating detail. The difference between Ovid (and for that matter Carson) and Bidart is that the former poets use interesting language, whereas Bidart's is boring and self-aggrandizing."
__label__2,"So cute!!!: We got this helmet for my two-year-old son. It seems good quality and it fits well but still has room for him to grow a little. I let him choose the pattern he wanted because a helmet is useless if your child won't wear it. Without hesitation he chose the duck. He loves his duck helmet! And since he chose it, he wants to wear it whenever he can. (I am thankful for this because I have a nephew who never wanted to wear his bike helmet and it was a real struggle for his parents.) My son looks so cute riding around on his tricycle with his little ducky helmet and I have peace of mind knowing he is protected."
__label__1,"George b: I see this highly rated and don't understand how that can be, unless screen visibility is of no concern to those reviewers. Look before you buy this one!I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them."
__label__1,not very good: i read all the tales of the jedi comics lately and the best thing you can say about this one is at least it's not as bad as fall of the sith empire. poorly done
__label__1,"I couldn't put it together!!: I'm not rating the furniture or Simplicity, I'm rating Baby Universe for shipping the wrong furniture. I didn't notice that they sent a combo of the Walnut and Cherry changing tables from the Ellis line. So, when my friends and I attempted to put it together, the screw holes on the cabinet pieces didn't line up. I thought that maybe it was me, so I called my cousin, the handy-man, to see if he could fix it. As we looked closer, we noticed that some pieces were lighter than others. Simplicity instructs you to call them if something's wrong and I did. They're sending an entirely new unit to me and will pay for shipping to return the faulty/unmatched unit. I'm due in 2 weeks so I'm purchasing a playpen/changing table/bassinet in case I deliver before Simplicity does."
__label__2,"Learn as much as you can before you go to Thailand.: This book was informative. It gives you a basic outline of the place. You can read this book, as well as look for pics and videos of Thailand on the internet. Especially videos on youtube. A pic is worth a 1000 words, and a video is worth 1,000,000 words. You really don't know until you see a video of the place, how it is going to feel, and then you still don't know exactly, but you have a much better idea. One thing that has helped me decide where to go, and where not to go, is a software app called TubeSucker. Do a google on TubeSucker to find it. The turbo version lets you do a ""Download All"" for a given search, and then you can quickly scan through 100s of Thailand videos on your hard drive with no delays. I use is for all my travels, including the beach of Mexico, India, and Italy. This book paints a decent picture of the place. But with video you can almost smell the smells."
__label__1,"Disappointing: The beginning started out interesting; then character development just didn't really happen as the focus became more on the romance; and the story line dragged and the dialog became repetitive. I will read it through to the end as I'm already 70% committed. This was not what I expected in light of the ratings it received. I was expecting sympathetic characters in line with Girl w/Dragon Tattoo, Hunger Games, even Twilight and The Hostess. I could not buy into the characters--they are all too nice and unreal--kinda made me want to gag. People really don't think/speak in full dialog as this writer depicts. I would summarize that this is a Reader's Digest read: a Harlequin romance trying to be a detective story. I seriously doubt I would read anything by Dee Henderson again after this flop."
__label__1,"No Spirit: I bought this as a gift, but was able to listen to it afterward. If you're not a Burning Spear fan (like me), I wouldn't start. The songs all sound alike, and there was no real musical spirit. As for reggae, I recommend Toots and the Maytals over Burning Spear any day."
__label__1,Incorrect image: As a British citizen in the USA I was looking for a British Union Flag (It isn't a Union Jack unless it is on a boat) and noticed that the red diagonal St Patrick's cross is missing on the photo. It may be that the flag you receive is different to the displayed photo but buyer beware - this image is not the British flag.
__label__1,not as good as I thought it would be: This game was not fun for me at all!!!!! This game is cartoonish and the graphics suck. The only thing good about this game is the gang battles and after awhile that gets boring also. I downloaded this game of the playstation network for $12.99 and it was not worth it.
__label__2,"Good overview of pre-columbian world: I have not kept up with recent research in pre-columbian america, and this book gave alot of good information on what the recent discoveries and controversies are. The information on how advanced and extensive some of the south American cultures were was good. However, I found myself getting a bit impatient with all the details about royal lineages, who killed who, etc. A bit more micro focus than I expected. The information on ecology and the impact of the native cultures on the landscape was very interesting. It seems there should be more interchange between biologists and anthropologists. The issue of what is natural and how humans fit in with the natural world has major implications for our world today."
__label__2,"Awesome if you can actually get it: I love this product and have it on auto-ship from ecom. However, I've received only one shipment of this product, ever. ecom has cancelled EVERY SINGLE ORDER due to product shortage. So, I love the product but hate the fact that ecom can never seem to get it to me."
__label__1,THE YEARLING: The Yearling is an awful book!!!!!!!!!! Don't ever read it!!!!!! If you read the yearling you will puke because it is just that awful!
__label__2,"Pleasing in every way: If you're looking for talent, look no further. Bob Dylan proves his artistic skill yet again--even surpassing his own excellent previous works. This collection of musical arrangements is as diverse as it is consistently excellent. The lyrics are variously thought-provoking, romantic, funny, witty, gentle, challenging, warm, engaging, symbolic, and interesting.My newest fantasy: being seated on a trans-Atlantic flight beside Bob Dylan. I would keep my mouth shut and my ears open. This old guy is brilliant."
__label__1,"Conant Copper Weather Station: I received this Conant Copper weather station but the dial was broken when received. I called ecom.com and they quickly supplied return postage and refunded my charge.If the dial was not broken and if the temperature dial had worked well, the quality looked good. But I would not recommend this to you as the shipping may cause the dial to fall off. I've seen similar (1/3 the cost) temperature dials at Lowes with some of the dials broken. Its not a robust design."
__label__1,"Scratched: Mine too was scratched out of the box. I wouldn't really care except it's scratched right where the screen is and is fairly large. I bought it simply to put in a Bose Sounddock because I didn't like the fact that the screen was exposed. It looks really sharp there (minus the scratch)Has anyone got a non-scratched one? (ie, is it even worth trying to replace it.)"
__label__1,"ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm...: What the hell is this? This has GOT to be illegal! I believe Doreen Valiente is the one who would give permission for Gardner's actual material re-printed, or it would be in the hands of their publisher from their original ""Book of Shadows"" published grimoire.Gerald's NAME isn't even SPELLED CORRECTLY on the cover! WTF? This, if nothing else, should be an indicator as to what the material is like. Who is this other author? Obviously not Valiente. I wouldn't credit this book more than the dirt on my shoe."
__label__1,"Poor and Cheap Makover of a Previously Great Grill: Poor Weber! I'm not sure what Weber keeps thinking, but they keep down grading their grills. This grill is the latest makeover of an exisitng product into something that is cheaper and not as good. They have eliminated the nice stainless steel work area and replaced it with cheap plastic. Additionally, the wire grill baskets for the coals are more like metal boats that don't allow enough air to flow freely around the coals. The gas control is now on the front of the grill and the charcoal bin leans out and is quite flimsy. Additionally the total workspace next to the grill has been reduced.If you can find one of the original Performers prior to the 2005 models, buy one of those...they are awesome and worth the money. This is more like a cheap knock off and not worth the money.Weber Weber Weber...what are you thinking?"
__label__1,"Childish Advice - Big Self Focus: As with other and better written negative reviews, I thought the advice was childish and obvious. The only reason I did not give it 1 star was that sometimes the simple solution (ie. buy assets and not liabilities) is lost in the forest and is worth pointing out. Do I need to read how his real father was such a financial idiot and how he copied the behavior of his friends dad so that he could write books stroking himself and justifying his souless existance? Probably not. There are far better financial books out there."
__label__1,For men with small calves: I am by no means large but this was way too tight on the calves. Also it was longer than I thought it would be. The combination made them very uncomfortable and I never wear them.
__label__1,"not very comfortable, hissy: these headphones play music well, but they are very tight on my head and i can only wear them for 20 minutes or so at a clip. the nise cancelling produces an extremely noisy hiss. they're pretty good on airplanes, not really anywhere less noisy."
__label__2,Wonderful insight!: Wonderful book with excellent suggestions for guidance that you can make use of right away. I plan to reread this book and keep it close for regular insight on a daily basis. After finishing this book I definitely feel more in tune to my angels and guides. I highly recommend it.
__label__1,Does Not Work: Unfortunately this product does not work because the ants will not go near it to partake of the liquid. The Raid Ant bait does not work either for the same reason so still looking for a remedy.
__label__2,"read, OR DON'T READ: It really really sucks. Such a sellout. And I usually don't like using that phrase. Hmmm, big disappointment for the fans. Everything is way beyond exaggerated and inflamed. Too much of good sound sometimes can go overboard, and that's exactly what happened here. Every tune is very unique and so fat (full) that instead of balanced mix there is a struggle for a better space.Not to mention the selection of certain musicians with so much amazing music out there right now. I mean 'Burma'? Really? Two U.N.K.L.E. songs? Double Really? Oh yes, also our fav underground DJ, in the compilation of 10 placed the very special, truly underground genius of FELIX DA HOUSECAT. Well, thanks! When I was expecting Sasha, I got 'Buy Our Flashy Merchandise' Sasha. Maybe he was trying to be safe, but that's what killed his sound on this disc.Five stars because I'm not an a hole"
__label__1,"Nice unit, until it fails, and that wont take long.: The CanoScan LiDE 600F worked great for about a month, then the mechanism began to jerk and blur the image. ecom replaced it, and the new one failed in about a month, with the mechanism frozen in the park position. Now I had to deal with Canon tech support. (and yes, for the idiots at Canan Tech Support, the shipping lock was unlocked.) The third unit arrived DOA.What happened? Canon used to be a name you could trust"
__label__1,"Simply Deep - Not Deep Enough: Although most of the songs are well written, Miss Rowland does not do the song writers justice. Her voice lacks depth and is not strong enough to carry a solo album (although nowadays, that doesn't seem to concern the music industry). With the negative press in the past concerning Destiny Child, Miss Rowland had to put out a solo project. My suggestion is more vocal training before attempting a sophmore project. I was hoping this project would put Miss Rowland on the map as a force to be reckon with as a female solo artist --- well, maybe next time."
__label__1,"Disappointing: I loved Fire and Ice and Red Sky at Morning. But I set this book down because the characters were so thin, if not self-absorbed. Frankly, I didn't want to go on the voyage with them, however harrowing it might be.Mr. Garrison, you can do better than this"
__label__2,"Nikon D40: This is a great camera at a great price. Buying from Beach Camera through ecom made good sense and saved me money. The camera itself is very good. I've used smaller cameras in the past and really like all the options I have with the D40. I still have my little point and shoot in my camera bag, but I hardly use it. The D40 is a much better buy than the D40X. Ask yourself if you really need the extra pixels before you spend the extra money. Right now I'm experimenting with all the features of the D40. It is smarter than I am, but that's not a bad thing. I can set it on Auto and click away."
__label__2,"Lyrics to Go: I picked up this album when it dropped back in the summer of '96. Eventhough I did not feel all of the tracks on the album, I immediately got caught up in the lyricism displayed by De La. The track with Common is tight as hell. I am sometimes amazed at how most folks don't appreciate the lyrical abilites of these brothas. Sheer lyrical creativity and innovative production without all the commericialized grimey gangsta B.S. Some of the tracks could be used to teach the elements of poetry to many ""hard to teach"" students."
__label__1,"Music is lovely but you can't play it at work on your computer: I heard this reviewed on NPR. The music mostly lives up to it's billing.However, the CD is heavily copy-protected and wouldn't play in my home entertainment PC or in my PC at the office.This makes the CD a very limited value."
__label__1,"not what it said: I ordered this textbook ""like new""..it came with with first 3 chapters water damaged (but still readable) and the front and back covers had both broken off their binding. I would not call that ""like new""."
__label__2,"WHAT A WONDERFUL TRIBUTE!: It's about time someone took this great theme and gave it a great twist for the millemum! The only thing that was missing(for me) would have been some voiceovers from the movie! This has a great techno beat & still has the magic of the original version. Now, if he could only do man's road...... All you TLU fans will love this, since anything TLU related is gettting harder & harder to find! GRAB IT WHILE YOU CAN!"
__label__1,The Oprah version? Are you kidding?: If I had ordered this assuming it was the David Attenborough version and ended up hearing Oprah's voice of illegitimate victimization instead I would have waited to eject the disk from the player so that I could vomit on it before returning it. But not before wiping boogars on the packaging.
__label__2,"Beautiful page-turner about love and music: I ordered this book because I enjoyed Lisa Tucker's first novel, The Song Reader. Shout Down the Moon did not disappoint! Patty is so real I felt like I'd known her all my life. Her struggles to take care of her baby boy touched me like no book I've read recently. Add on the music, as Patty learns to sing her heart, and this is another great book by Tucker. My only question is whether Patty will end up with Jonathan. I hope so."
__label__1,They changed the collar: Jockey changed the shape of their crew neck T. Now it isn't as good. Before the collar didn't stick out the back of sweaters as much as it does now. Booooo.
__label__2,"Motorola Ojo's Realism: I spoke to my nephew, who is 3, today on the Ojo. It was interesting to say the least. He was very excited to see me, but didn't seem to understand the concept that this was a video and essentially not real. He asked to see my dog, which he tried to pet through the Ojo and was very disappointed when he couldn't. I thought he was going to cry. He kept begging my fiancee to let him come to my room. Which we atttempted to explain to him that I was far away and that was not possible.I thought our conversation was educational not because of what we dicussed (he is only 3), but of his reactions to the Ojo.If the Ojo could keep his attention for a 1/2 hour and make him think that he could touch a puppy through it, the video quality must be pretty realistic."
__label__1,"Nice Read - Not As Described: I have read the other two reviews and only agree with the first reviewer. I have been flying for 28 years as both a recreational pilot and a professional commercial airline pilot. I expected this book to be a guide and full of practical advise for my son who is in the middle of his career as a pilot. It is not. It is seriously over priced and over hyped. I agree there are much better books out there for advice and instruction. Do yourself a favor and try to get this from the library if you want to read it, do not spend the money."
__label__1,"Midland WR-300 not easy: I am an experience computer user, nevertheless, to this day, I have not been able to get this weather radio to function as well as my previous Radio Shack weather radio. The severe weather warnings do not play automatically but I do get lots of sirens without identifying the reason, although mostly seems to be for weekly checks.The user document must have been written in foreign countries. I would not recommend."
__label__2,"Yup, It's GONZO!! and I'm addicted!!: Well, what can I say.... This series deffinatly is not what I expected, however I still have to say that I am really enjoying it!! The stories follows a boy named Hajiki Sanada and his strugles to try to support his family after the passing of his father. Hajiki works as a delivery boy for a local delivery service in a town known simply as Night Town. When he is asked to make a special delivery to an unknown buyer, he stumbles upon a small stone known as a Gad, which is is mysteriously facinated by. Eventually his conection with the Gad increases as he witnesses the Gad evolve into a giant robot known as a Techode. Though the series starts off very slowly, it has alot of promise in terms of a clasic Mecha Story Line. I wouldn' recomend this series to just anybody, however if you are a fan of mecha and do not think that Evangellian is the only good mecha out there (which it's not), than you would probably enjoy this series, so check it out :)"
__label__2,XBox Live Card: Product recieved in a timely manner and in the condition as expected. The time cost benefits of buying through ecom greately out weigh buying direct from Microsoft.
__label__1,"Not very useful: I bought this mirror when my baby was only a few days old so I could keep an eye on her when she's in her carseat. It worked well at first but then it sort of frosted over and now I can't see anything in it. It's just cloudy and nothing will make it go away. I've tried Windex, soap and water, damp cloth..."
__label__2,Great music to soothe you: This man and his music will takeyou to places in your heart that maywell have been buried. So open yourselfand let his music bathe your soul.Highly recommended.
__label__1,"Really Bad: Terrible film.................bad music, all characters were miscast, and too much very poor cgi. The costumes were ridiculous and the sets were poorly designed and dressed. Most Holmes films are enjoyable...this one was not."
__label__1,"Does nothing but dirty: I got these at my local Petco store, figured I could use them when I went home for spring break. My mistake, these things are pieces of junk. I placed one in my bettas tank and it sunk watched and it did not appear to release any food. Plus it has plugged up two filter cartridges in just a matter of days. I do not recommend these."
__label__1,"Arrived Defective: I needed to purchase a basic, whistling teakettle. I chose a Farberware kettle because I had owned one previously and been very satisfied. Unfortunately, this kettle leaked lots of steam around the lid which I considered a safety hazard. The whistle was inaudible as well. The kettle was attractive and a good size, which earn it two stars. On the plus side, ecom furnished a postage-paid label for the return and credited my account promptly. I would not hesitate to order another teakettle from ecom."
__label__2,an entertaining read: I look forward to each of Rei's new adventures. This latest one did not disappoint me.
__label__2,"NO HOME SHOULD BE WITHOUT IT!: I use it in my bathtub to remove dark oil looking stains. Nothing else worked until I accidently used it on my tub. Wow, what a miracle product."
__label__2,Beautiful little book: Beautiful little book with positive meditations to begin or end your day! A joy to read on a regular basis.
__label__1,"""Vengence is mine!"" sayeth Jon Atack: I read this book already some years ago. It is - as the many others on the subject - full of biased ""information"" and seems to serve only one purpose: The childish revenge of a certain Mr. Atack on an organization which didn't want to deal with his bad manners and deceitful character and threw him out. What else can be expected by apostates?! To get an idea of the scriptures of Scientology I recommend to check for primary literature in libraries, any Scientology organization (There is plenty of them and they can be found in the phone book) or at ecom.com using keyword search ""L. Ron Hubbard""."
__label__2,Works well: Start up...yes but this is normal...took 4-5 days but had been flawless ever since.My only complaint would be that its a bit noisy! It sits in my sump and it is the only thing that makes noise from that area and its quite loud!
__label__2,"Way Cool: This book has so many wonderfully funny parts - Ce'nedra jumping up ""OH, NO!"", Relg's and Taiba's ""little theological discussions"", ""This isn't going to work, Rhodar,"" Anheg turned to the rotund monarch in disgust, ""What are we going to call her? The Overlady of the West?"", and so on. I memorized what is given of Ce'Nedra's first speech. I love these books! Breathe deep, seek peace. Tin"
__label__1,"Garbage: This is probably one of the worst things I have every gotten.I was trying to improve signal strength and it appear and the antenna would be helpful. The signal strength of this thing is pitiful. I had better signal with a cheap usb adapter than with this. Plus setup is difficult. When you get it set up there is no way to save your selection as to whether to have their software or windows manage the connection. Every time you do anything with your connection there is a pop up which asks you if you want Netgear or Windows to manage your connection. This thing is going back. By the way, I bought it through a brick and mortar store but I want to warn anyone on ecom who was thinking of buying this. The name Rangemax is a joke."
__label__1,"Decent enough... but SPOILERS: Does just about every romance have to judge the heroine on whether or not she wants kids? Really? Can we have a book in which the heroine doesn't want children and not have it be some sort of MORAL test or a crippling fear. (""Poor girl, she doesn't know what she wants. We must show her what a True Woman is - a mother!"")How about a heroine who knows what she wants and other characters who don't PRESSURE her into something else?"
__label__2,composition of product: The Five Crowns cards purchased at ecom.com are very difficult for children to shuffle. It would be nice to have a choice of plastic playing cards available even at a higher price. I have always been satisfied with ecom's products and service.
__label__1,"The book equivalent of shovelware: There were a lot of first generation ASP/Interdev books that were poorly done. I didn't complain about them, because first generation books on a new technology need to be cut some slack. This, however, is a second generation book and it deserves a lot of contempt.This book squanders half of it 623 pages covering the following (non-ASP/Interdev ) topics: VBScript, JavaScript, CSS, and DHTML. This coverage is superficial (mostly a property, event, and method table dump). The reader would be better off getting the full specifications off the web.Unfortunately, the coverage of ASP and Interdev is just as superficial. The author defines the difference between file and machine DSNs in two short inaccurate paragraphs and then keeps referring the reader to that definition as if it was useful.This book consumed several hours without providing any useful information."
__label__1,"So mediocre music is consider good now ?: Hmmm... A sound that repeats it self over & over again is actullie consider good? Can you people tell these songs apart? Siriously.Anywho, bleeding throught's "" this is love, this is murderous"" basically sounds like a worse version of atreyu mixing the same ussual lame and unoriginal typical sound of the sorry/trendy mallcore genger. Look past it. I mean, this album should be called this is bad music, this is poison."
__label__2,"moving and intelligent: This is a very moving an dintelligent book, with some marvellous and memorable lines. The book's first poem, 'Father and Son', brought tears to my eyes, while many of the others, 'History of Doing Nothing' (about laziness), 'Short Life of a Thought' (about what hapens in the mind as a thought takes shape) and 'Belgitude' (about being form Belgium) will stay with me.This is what poetry shoudl be: accessible, articulate, memorable.D. Rodway"
__label__2,Excellent: This set is exactly as described and is of excellent quality. The packaging is premium and well done. Thanks for making this series available. Excellent quality at a good price.
__label__1,not worth a rental even: This movie has a concept that will make you mildly chuckle. That's the first minute of the movie. The rest of the time you'll be sitting with a half-smile on your face waiting for something funny or interesting to happen. This half-smile will eventually turn into a look of disinterest and then the eye-rolling will start. It's a shame because I have a lot of respect for all the people who took part in it and have enjoyed their previous works.
__label__2,Great UK Hip Hop: Pretty good from a scene that's probably better than america. great beats and macho rhymes.
__label__1,Overpriced and weak handle: I was disappointed at how weak the handle was considering how beefy it looks in the picture. The problem is that the flat metal piece of meatal between the thick handle and ring is just too thin. Straining a full load would cause the whole basket to sag to the point where I thought the spot weld were going to break. My old plastic handle strainer deflected less than this metal one. You can see why I would be disappointed considering this is an expensive strainer.The spot welds that attach the handle to the steel ring also look very weak. I can see why the last reviewer's handle broke.The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because it does look nice. But all show and no-go doesn't cut it in my kitchen.
__label__2,"One of the best shows ever.: I used to watch this all the time when I was a kid, and I still love it today. Will Smith was hilarious on this show, and it really helped to catapult him to super-stardom. I loved how he was always making fun of Carlton, who was always just so goofy, and kind of full of himself. And it was also hilarious how Will used to dress back then, with the weird, multi-colored shirts, and that crazy high flat-top hairdo that all the black guys had 15 years ago. Nostalgic in a fun way. Anyway, great show, and a beloved part of my childhood.Oh, and the theme song was the first song I ever learned how to play on the drums."
__label__2,shimmery....fresh feeling: I had used Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener in the past... LOVED it... couldn't find it in any stores anymore so went on line... was THRILLED that I could still get it... Love it....ordered three !!! :)
__label__1,"World's most concise plot summary: Life didn't go how I planned. I got cancer. My career tanked. I had disappointments. Good people have bad things happen to them. Many religious people behave badly. Many formal religions are in conflict and therefore some of them are obviously wrong. Therefore there is no god. And by the way, I am smarter than the rest of you.There's a reason they call them ""believers"", not ""know-ers"". Anyone who gives an answer other than ""I don't know"" or ""I believe there is"" when asked about the existence of God is an arrogant fool. They didn't think there were germs 200 years ago. After all, there was no ""proof""."

__label__1,ok: we got this kent super scooter for our daughter for Christmas... It took about 3 hours to put it together... The breaks suck bad.... Had a very hard time getting the breaks adjusted and then they wouldn't break on the tires.... Other than the breaks sucking the scooter is nice....
__label__1,"Go, Save the Queen: Ann is a scary woman. The fact that people out there like this actually get to vote explains how Bush got into office. Run and hide people! THIS is Right Wing propaganda. The basic message is that Liberals are idiots and it's good to be greedy and selfish as long as you thump a Bible every once in a while. I love America!"
__label__2,"Functional -- Not the Height of Style: Well, This case isn't the crem de la crem of projector cases, but it doesn't cost $100 or more. If you are looking for functionality it does just fine and the price is, IMHO, fair for what you get. The bag fits the projector very well and the strap is comfortable for short hauls in & out of rooms which is my need. There is a side pocket the can contain the manuals, cables, etc. The case is black canvas and should protect well from scratches and light precipitation -- agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't have a lot of padding. This case is light and not much larger than the projector -- agree that this is a huge improvement over the box.I'm also OK with buying the case as a separate item because this projector is as good, again IMO, as many that cost a lot more. Having the case as a separate item allows those who want and need a case to get one -- since some projectors get permanently parked a case isn't always needed."
__label__1,Too Big!!!: Demasiado grandes!!!Tooo Bigggg!!!At the description they must say they're women's' sunglasses.The material also seems very cheap.I will buy Bolle no more...Sorry I spent my money in this out of fashion skeleton.Se debe especificar que son lentes para mujer.El material parece barato de muy mala calidad.No compraría la marca Bolle otra vez.
__label__2,"easy walk harness curbed pulling: I bought this easy walk harness for my Australian Shepherd. He's only 40lbs but has pulled me off my feet in the past. I've tried several other harnesses to get him to stop pulling. I've only had this a short while, but the walks have been the most enjoyable, as he does not pull my arms out of their sockets. I would recommend this product to anyone with a dog who pulls. It's fairly straight forward to fit and to use. Enjoy!"
__label__1,"Disappointing at best: I approached this DVD with an open mind, even though I believe radio shows turned into animation is akin to the colorization of classic black and white films. It did not take long to confirm my suspicions. The animation is computer generated and jerky, and the characters robotic in movement and general appearance, and Ronald Adams' car seems to be more like a fugitive from a ZZ Top album than from 1940. Don't waste your money on this turkey."
__label__2,"The Non Traditional Jesus: Phipps contends that Jesus was a master at using humor and wit to convey his message. Sometimes the Jewish leaders were the brunt of his humor, but, as Phipps points out, this tactic of public speaking was not unheard of in Jesus' time. Phipps suggests that many of the harder sayings of Jesus make more sense if interpreted as humorous sayings (such as a camel going through the eye of a needle). Phipps also proposes that the Gospels tell us much more about the personal and sexual character of Jesus than we are willing to see. He suggests that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. The Wisdom and Wit of Rabbi Jesus raises some interesting issues about who Jesus was, what he primary taught, and the teaching techniques he used to spread his message. It is a good commentary which breathes fresh insight into several of the more difficult passages in the Gospels."
__label__1,"Fall short of the book..... REAL short: Anytime a movie is made from a book, the producers ""trim the fat"" to make the film more appealing to the audience. Eragon takes this to a whole new level. The mysticism of being a dragonrider is removed. The hardships of the journey across the land are removed. The politics of the book... gone! Also a good majority of the plot is stricken from the record. This film could have easily been as epic as Lord of the Rings. But apparently the director/producers wanted a film empty of plot and full of special effects. I think that a casual movie goer may enjoy this film a bit, but any fan of the book will be sorely disappointed."
__label__1,"Downside vs Upside....: Downside:No digital copy !? Really -- wow, cheap...And no discount coupon or rebate offered for people who ponied up the $30 for the first Blu-ray release.Upside:16 minutes of footage.....My vote on this one ---- Pass, rent it maybe for the 16 minutes of footage, but its not worth buying."
__label__2,"Mr. Coffee rocks my girlfriends socks off: Well, the ecom.com specs for the machine are incorrect...it's 7 oz. 9 oz. or 14 oz. (the 14 takes 2 pods and is STRONG!!!) Good machine, good coffee, great price (got it for $31 @ Wal-Mart after using a $10 manufac. coupon."
__label__2,"A very powerful little book.: One-hundred short 2-page ideas/suggestions that really open your eyes about the way your mind works. Gets into the psychology of why we think and do such stupid and self-defeating stuff, and shows you a better way to handle everyday situations.If you're stressed-out or angry at anything, this book will put your problems in perspective and put your mind at peace. I plan on keeping it handy to refer to whenever I'm in a lousy mood. I found (and dog-eared) several pages that described me and my attitudes exactly. There are several people I know at work who really NEED this book.Highly recommended!"
__label__2,"Decent Looking 'Cheap' Sunglasses: I bought two pairs of these. Kept one and gave the other to may Dad. We both enjoy them. They look fine and are great for the beach, throwing around in the car, etc... You should not be purchasing these with the expectation that they are going to be identical to brand name though as they definitely aren't."
__label__2,"Great Book!: I totally recommend this book. The poems are wonderful, as are the illustrations in the book. My kids love it!"
__label__1,"Not a thing: I am sorry, but I didn't experience anything with this diet formula. I was just as hungry, and there was no change in my energy level. I gave it chance and took almost the whole bottle before I came to the conclusion I had wasted my money."
__label__2,"Oh my god! I almost bought the iBook!: What a mistake that would have been! First off this computer is absolutly beautiful and completely functional in its design. I don't feel confined to a desk in the least. My PowerBook fits comfortly in my lap, the keyboard is large and the keys have a solid springy resistantance. The display is amazing! It doesn't look like anything else I have seen out there. Widesceen, clear, sharp and easy on the eyes. I don't feel any eyestrain in the least. OS X (10) is so fluid, beautiful, sparklely and truely easy to use. iTunes and iMovie 2 do not disappoint. Voice control that will make you want to name your computer Hal. The new lower price and the free double RAM really makes this hard to pass up. Did I mention the DVD player? Apple has out done themselves with this machine. I cannot recomend this notebook highly enough."
__label__2,This will open your eyes regardless your political view.: This author is a Libertarian and regardless your political pursuasion this book will give you something to think about. It gives great insight into libertarian thinking. Whether you agree with this man or not you will come away with a better understanding of the political motivation behind some of our hottest political issues and a desire to learn more.
__label__2,Stylish and functional watch: Very nice watch for the price. Has a solid feel and face is well designed.
__label__2,"Invaluable: There are a million books on starting businesses, and every five years or so one comes along that raises the bar. Ehrenfeld's breakthrough book on entrepreneurship presents a sharp set of tools that set it apart from the pack. Clear, concise writing makes the difference. While many entrepreneurs have been successful in business, they haven't been able to give others the right information. In The Startup Garden, you'll get a complete toolkit and -- perhaps most important -- the keys to timing your business so that you have the true sense of an entrepreneur. This book won't help someone like Steve Jobs, but for the rest of us, it's worth its weight in stock certificates."
__label__2,"I was diagnosed: I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was advised to research the topic as best I could using internet sources which sometimes need a dose of cynisism. I was given this book and lo and behold, all my fears were allayed. Not only did Dr Scardino describe the basics of prostate cancer, but gave all the alternatives for treating it including side effects possible problems and expected outcomes, historical notes and a glimpse of the way forward.Dr Scardino's book will guide you in your own personal decision making.If you have been diagnosed as positive, get this book and read all about it. Well worth it."
__label__1,"For girls only: The main character is an idiot, if you're a guy spare yourself. They tried to rip off the x-files but did an awful job."
__label__1,"A mataphor?: The title must be a metaphor for West himself, because only someone as uneducated and stupid as he is would think as much of this garbage and himself as he does."
__label__1,"Don't Buy Ott: Buyers, be warned! I bought an Ott Lite a year ago, and was using it for needlework. Then one day, it did not work. I bought a new bulb for it, and it still didn't work. Then I learned about the ballast problems, and join the long line of people that bought from Ott and have expensive lights that no longer work. A beautiful lamp is now done for. I'll never buy another Ott product again. Steer clear!"
__label__2,"Good reading, insightful, a little weird: There's something unsettling about Palahniuk's writing style - something that seems just not quite right - but his stories always pull me in and I have to read until the story's finished. All of the essays here had the same effect on me. Some are simply weird and appeal to the Beavis in us all (""Testy Festy""). Most are glimpses into cultural cast asides that we miss because we aren't looking. I liked the personal essays that mostly revolve around the reactions by Palahniuk and others in response to the success of the film ""Fight Club.""Good reading that makes you look a little harder at everything you take for granted."
__label__2,"Extremely Good and Capable DVD player: This is a very good DVD player. I have used now for some weeks, and tested it with Progressive scan as well as the interlaced mode. The picture quality is sharp and vivid with no traces of any artifacts, edge jagging etc. Without wasting any one's time, I would say that if you are a perfectionist this is the DVD player for you."
__label__2,"Best book in the series......wonderful!: Ms. Quinn's writing has improved with each book, TO SIR PHILLIP, WITH LOVE has more emotions and depth than any of her other books. This book touches your heart, it isn't one of the light fluffy marshmallow reads most of her readers expect.Phillip's walk into the sunlight with Eloise is not to be missed. Ms. Quinn relieves some of the seriousness with Phillip's two mischievous twins and of course, a visit from Eloise's family will give readers a laugh."
__label__1,Not good: This play has poor acting. It features Fantasia Barrino (American Idol winner) and Faith Evans (R&B Singer). The two top stars only have cameo appearances and sing one song each. The remainder of the movie centers around the Gay club owner whose acting skills are not that great. The whole play was overdone as far as the acting was concerned and could have been done in alot better taste. Basically the whole play just drags on until you finally get to end which is horrible also.
__label__2,"What I expected: Item exactly as described. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The only downside is that the pieces are not weighted. Besides, the set is a lot of fun"
__label__2,"Excellent workout!: I ordered this DVD because I wanted something low impact for someone really out of shape but still gives a great workout. I picked the perfect DVD. I am not experienced with Pilates or Yoga and I was still able to do this DVD. The pace is slow enough and the moves are simple enough that you can follow along easily. The mood is very serene and calming and you don't realize how much you've done because your so calm. But I still broke a sweat! I only did the first half to start out and I was worn out! I could feel every muscle in my body and felt like a rubber band. It was amazing. I had so much energy afterwords that I felt like I could run a marathon. Don't get me wrong, it's tough if you don't have any experience, just to get used to all the different moves and stretches but trust me you will feel wonderful when you are done. Try this DVD, it is worth the money."
__label__1,"The Sacred Stones: I read the previous 3 books by this author and found them intriguing. There was a certain level of gore and cruelty that sickened me, but I could get through it. However, Sacred Stones begins immediately with the sacrifice of a young virgin girl named Ahnee. William Sarabande develops her characters so well that the reader immediately relates to their plight, feels their pain and confusion and suffers slowly through their demise. I stopped reading the book after Ahnee's horrible and painful death. She was only 12 years old. I won't continue to read an author that describes in vivid detail the murders and cruel rapes performed slowly and viciously on unsuspecting children. Ugh...!"
__label__1,"Connection Problems - cannot use all features: I have had this router for over a year. It worked well for the most part. But every once in a while I got problems with connection, for which I had to call customer support.Now suddenly it has become a big pain ... Both wired and wireless connections drop every 10 mins because router reboots itself. I have made over a dozen calls to tech support, but the problem has remained.The other thing is that D link tech support always tells you to go with basic 802.11b config with no encryption ( the most they would let me do was WEP, and always turned down WPA ). So even though this router has a lot of cool features ( super G, WPA, gaming mode etc. etc. ) , you are not allowed to use any of them. That is because if you try and it does not work, tech support will always tell you to turn all of them off. Thus all I have is a powerful router being used as basic 802.11b."

__label__1,"You Shall Know Our Duplicity: This is the worst, most meandering, sophomoric book I have ever picked up. Witness the hype machine printing money in full force as the pomo critics at the corporate conglomerates spam the world with ridiculous blurbs, all hoping to be allowed to publish in McSweeneys someday.I challenge anyone who has read this book to answer this--who are the characters? What are they up against? What moral dilemmas to they face? Who is the protagonsit, the antagonist? What is the catharsis? Why should we care about them? Is it a tragedy or comedy? What happens? Who changes? Where is the dramatic action? Who falls in love?Sadly, the novel is lacking these classical traits. Eggers lacks the talent to render them, and perhaps the incentive too, as a far better living can be made off of meandering, pandering hype, wasting shelf space and killing trees to fund the great egos of our generation."

__label__2,A Great Escape Book: A great book about WWII escape. I couldn't put book down once I started reading. A must read for anyone interested in WWII history.
__label__2,Awesome - One Of The Best CDs Ever and One Of Pearl Jams bes: This CD Rocks and is one of the best CDs of all time.Enough said.The only criticism is of the photo of the band on the Album cover who are wearing some of the most atrocious clothes I have ever seen.Pearl Jam don't have another CD that matches up to this.So get it.
__label__1,am I crazy or did people actually like this?: first off...let me say I am a huge everclear fan. I've seen them live plenty of times and love every record they put out. That said...I've listened to this record twice and tried my hardest to like it....but after two attempts...I sold it back..the songs don't make any sense to me...they have no flow and just basically sound like noise I could make in my basement....after seeing all of the positive reviews I feel someone has to take the other side of the debate
__label__1,"This book is sad, the characters are sad, it is ALL sad sad sad: God I hated this book. It was just depressing. I knew what Ms. Shreve was doing with the back and forth of stories and the similarites, etc. and I wanted to see how she would get there...but the going was just sad and depressing. I have read several of her books and have enjoyed many aspects of her writing and the sometimes haunting nature of her stories. This one was just predictable and sucked the enjoyment of reading out of it and I will never get the time I spent reading it back again. I think it was agonizing, not terribly smart, and I think she has lost me as a reader."
__label__1,One broke after a month: The glasses keep things cool for awhile but I had one break already by washing it. Kind of disappointed that it broke so soon.
__label__2,"Luminous!: A collection of well-crafted poems that take the reader across rural landscapes, through hospitals and henhouses, and into the bright, ever hopeful minds of people. There's Joe, who remembers in his Alzheimer fog the brilliant June day of courtship long ago. There's Ida, who seeks comfort from her chickens. And there's cocktail-swilling Winnie, a God-talking rooster, a punk teenager,and a refrigerator so new that it too is practically living and breathing. This is a lovely book, peopled with intriguing characters, and well deserving of its awards."
__label__2,"Great Book but Wish for Matching Hypnosis CD!: I bought a few hypnobirthing CDs, and books from different sources. Mongan's book is great and very practical to use for any type of person. I wish she had a package you could buy with a hypnosis CD or two. Of all the products on this topic, hers was the best. Unfortunately, hers is the only one I bought used. I wasted a lot of money on inferior hypnobirthing products elsewhere. There was one other site which I enjoyed; they were guided imagery tapes [...] I had my baby very comfortably using these methods!!!! I heathly seven pound girl in April!"
__label__2,"My fave college album: At college I was a DJ in my senior year at the school radio station - for my show my intro was Strange Magic and my exit music was One Summer Dream, both from this album. In my opinion, with this album ELO really started to click, paving the way for their following successes."
__label__2,PROVOCATIVE AND COMPELLING: Hagee makes his lastest installment a great pleasure to read. Believers an non-believers will find that this book will make you ponder what you did in this life. Take a chance on this with patience to finish it.
__label__2,"Really good shoes!: These shoes are great! I own a pair already and I've had them for nearly two years and have worn them in a medical/dental environment. The flooring at my workplace is mostly that nubby, low-pile carpeting that has torn up or worn down other shoe soles in no time at all -- most of my other shoes haven't made it past 6 months! The toes have had the black polish worn away, but some shoe polish and a quick shine with a soft cloth takes care of it.The only drawback is that I have a narrow heel, which makes it easy for me to twist my ankle. My remedy was to wear thicker socks, and that fixed it right up! I still love these shoes, even though I've pretty much worn them out now, that's why I'm ordering them again. I'll probably order two pair so should Ariat decide to do away with this shoe, at least I'll be set for another 4-5 years."
__label__1,WET!: This is a terrible product because all it did was soak the floor. All the steam just condensed 1 inch away from it and landed on it or the floor.
__label__2,"lightweight yet solid: I love this little radio! After lugging around another brand ""pocket size"" radio, this one is light as a feather! I'm still not exactly sure how to program the thing (as other reviewers stated, the little owners manual leaves something to be desired, but it is a great little unit) It has a little button where you ""lock"" in what you are listening to so that it doesn't inadvertently skip to another station. Yet, you can still adjust the volume even though the station is locked in! Good feature. I researched these little pocket size radios because I want to listen to music, talk radio and tv shows while walking my dog. This is just what I was looking for. Seems like a solid little unit. I bought this one over the DT 200 because this has an auto=turn=off feature after 90 minutes, (the other unit, DT 200 shut off after 60 minutes. Too soon for me. Plus, I think I read that you can disable this feature in the DT 210 but not the DT 200... Go for this little unit. You'll be happy."
__label__2,"Very Good!: I picked this lil gem up at Wally World for 3 buck, and diddnt dissapoint me! The Halloween track almost sounds better than the original. The highlights are tracks 1, 2, 5, and 11. This cd helps spark the halloween spirit. Not bad for a few bucks."
__label__1,"The case is not made by Sony!!: This case is advertise as Sony PSP Hard Shell Case and you think that it is a Sony product, but it is not! I don't know who actually makes it, but the problems with it is that it is bulky and the UMD case looks like it was glued to the top. It is also a ugly color of blue. The item is big and bulky. If you don't care about size and looks the go for it, but otherwise look around!"
__label__1,bad service: My watch stopped and the company didn't provide an international warranty. the customer said the watch has to be shipped back to the company and i have to cover the cost both ways. very bad service.
__label__1,"""Whisper His Name"" is not up to Thornton's other books.: I used to say, ""I'll read anything written by Elizabeth Thornton."" However, ""Whisper His Name"" was a total disappointment. I couldn't make it past Page 99, and even that was an effort."
__label__2,"Exactly what I needed; however, note of caution about orientation of rack: The world may be turning toward digital-only video, but mini-DV tapes still offer a measure of back-up not afforded by digital media.This storage rack is very sturdy, and perfect for keeping tapes organized.One word of warning: unless I'm mistaken, tapes should not be stored over the long term with their spools horizontal to the earth, as would be the case in the picture of the rack. Therefore, if hung on a wall or set on a shelf, the rack should have a ""portrait"" orientation. On the positive side, it's perfect for putting safely into a drawer."
__label__2,"cloe- the cutest bratz baby!: cloe is so adorable! i think she has the cutest little pig tails! the reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have baby sasha and sometimes i can get sick of her. i might only get sick of her because she only has 2 outfits and theres nothing really left 2 do with her, though. so, my advice is that if u r gonna get this doll for like a ten year old or older then it probably wont be very fun for them unless they get alot of outfits and accessories for the doll, so that they have something to do with it, and so it can be fun to put different outfits on it. i definitely recommend this doll for younger kids, but i dont recommend it for older kids as much."
__label__1,Received Defective Product Twice: The pre-seasoning coat was chipped and peeling on the dutch oven I received. I didn't want it flaking off in the food so I exchanged it. The second one I received has the same problem. How frustrating. I am not going to try for a third.
__label__1,"Snooooze: This film is soo nothing. The only time its interesting is when Gollum is on screen . The rest suuucks. Stupid hollywood cheese jokes about dwarf tossing and skating a rail with a sheild. Embarrassing. Lifeless story and perfomances, bar Gollum. Worst of the Trilogy. Give me Krull anyday."
__label__2,"It Ain't No Joke! Turnin' Fitty: Wow! very informative reading that mentally prepares us for the next half cent of living. It is a refresher of life looking back and reiterates in so many words that the reason the windshield is bigger than the rearview mirror is because it is more important where we are going than we we are coming from.Definitely a fun read with contributions from many recognized resident experts. Get this book before you turn fifty so you can set your GPS on the future and make the best of the senior adventures ahead.The book ends on a super positive message ""Trade Strength for Wisdom"" Your going to love it!Read this book and pass it down to the next person approaching 5-0."
__label__1,"Plastic gear teeth broke on 1st use: I researched the blender and accepted Consumer Reports' recommendation as a ""best buy"". I was wary about the reports of the plastic gear teeth breaking but CR indicated that recent tests were fine. The plastic teeth broke the very 1st time I used it making a smoothie with partially frozen strawberries (not even ice cubes). It did a good job chopping up the strawberries and blending it into a creamy smoothie but getting one use out of it is unacceptable. It's already packed up to be shipped back."
__label__1,"Disappointing and Unhelpful: Speaking as someone with a degreee in math, plus some graduate work, I found this book frustrating and disappointing. I wanted to fill in some historical perspective to all the math I had learned, but I was little illuminated by this book. While the author clearly knows a lot about math, his writing is vague, poorly organized, and unfocused. He answered few of my questions and does not present a coherent picture of his topic. Rather than this book, I recommend Morris Kline ""Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times"", which is infinitely better."
__label__1,"Things you should know before you buy this!: I used to listen to his show every day, but after reading the book, I can't bring myself to hear his voice... I for one was disappointed that the ""book"" was a compilation of his therapy journals. I had always considered Greenie a sort of 'everyman' sportscaster... a real fan with a real fan's perspective. Now, I consider him to be a self serving pompous sportscaster like the rest of them. ""everyman"" would never refer to himself continuously as ""a little famous,"" and a neighbor of billionaires, and certainly would never have the unmitigated gall to compare an internet rumor about himself to the fan adulation received by Bo Jackson! If you really want to read this, get on the waiting list at your library, borrow it from a friend or at least wait until the paperback."
__label__1,"This one's a true DUD: I purchased this humidifier in December. Less than two months later it has stopped working. Dealing with customer support has been a waste of time. They provided some instructions that did not even apply to the model I purchased. Lots of run around in email chains also, appearing that they have techinical support, but when it comes down to it, they'll ask you to lug it back to wherever you purcahsed it. If I could rate it a negative star, on a one to five scale, this one would get a -5 and their customer support a -5. Oh forget the 5 year warranty. With all the run around, I doubt it will be honored."
__label__1,"Very fun to read but the facts given are questionable: I found this book very fun to read. Kenneth C. Davis is a fine writer but I question the facts he gives. Also, at times this seems to be more of a history book the one on geography. Mr. Davis' view of historical events is very opinionated to put it mildly and he could have done more research when dealing with countries where he does not have first hand knowledge. You can throw out the whole section on Japan. It is just one big joke. Really, Mr. Davis, take a look at any supermarket in Japan. There are tons of dairy products. Also, there are large cow ranches throughout Japan. Also, his section on Hawaii was very one sided. He must have not bothered to reseach the material from a Hawaiian poin of view.If you want an enjoyable read, this is a great book. But, take the facts with a grain of salt."
__label__2,"Perfect for my needs: I didn't want a huge countertop knife block, or a 20-slot monster for the drawer, this one is perfect. Basic, well-made, gets the job done. Other comments about the true size are correct, make sure you know which dimensions are correct before you buy it."

__label__1,"Not worth the shipping fee: This was very poor quality, and not at all strong. The plastic is cheap, not strong at all. I suppose, as someone else mentioned, if you were *extremely* sensitive it would do, but with only one speed it just does not cut it for me. As well, the batteries did not last very long and are expensive to replace. The top kept popping off and wouldn't stay on which was frustrating. Over all, not worth the price at all as there are many other better quality products for similar prices!"

__label__2,25 years later ToTo is still explosive: I've been a ToTo fan since their inception in 1977. I was fortunate enough to see and hear them live in New Orleans during the 1985 Isolation Tour. After watching this live video and listening to the live cd I can see and hear the energy level in their music like it was still 1977. This is a powerful live performance that will leave you with a greater respect for their musical ability. These guys are some of the most respected players in the music industry and have been for a few decades. It's nice knowing that they are still performing and influencing the younger generation of apprentice musicians.
__label__1,"This game is terrible: My daughter just received this as a birthday gift. We have all the requirements to be able to run it. However, after trying to download it the game will not play and when I tried to uninstall and try again, it states that ""no file name"" ""could not load language"" and one other thing I can't recall right now. So, we have a game she can't play and junk on my computer I can not unload. Very angry about it! Definitely would not recommend this game."
__label__2,Wish it was available in Blu-ray: I love this series. So peaceful. Too bad it is standard def. Ran on PBS HD a lot a few years ago. Looking forward to it being available on Blu-ray from KUED someday.
__label__1,"Can't believe people like this book: Come on people. The writing quality is barely high-school level, assuming that it was translated fairly. How many times can one endure reading the same message over and over? ""Follow your Personal Legend."" Geez. If this is a revelation, you need to get out and challenge yourself more."
__label__2,This book is pure fun: This is one of my favourite craft books. Most of the projects are fairly quick so making gifts that people will love is a breeze. I helped a friend who had never sewed before make Steve the cat. She was so happy with it. Her husband couldn't believe that she had made it herself. This a great book to get people excited about sewing because a beautiful and inexpensive project can be completed in less than 2 hours. I hope Denyse will write another book soon. I'd love to see Steve the dog and some funky bags and hats.
__label__2,"Quiet and sufficent but it is cool mist: This cool mist is one of the best. I knew because I owned several different brands. This one served the purpose and it is quiet. I did not give it a five stars because I am still shopping for a warm mist and quiet one. If I cannot find another warm mist and it's quiet, I will buy another one of this cool mist to replace my current warm mist."
__label__2,"Hard-hitting advice, easily retained: I listened to this tape in about 1978 and have just read the hard copy that came with it. The written version strikes me as powerfully now as the tape did then. I would write more, but the time-saving advice found on the tape and in the hard copy bid me to save my own time by stopping here. Buy this tape."
__label__1,Disaster!!! Do NOT buy!: 1. Color same for all clips making it extremely difficult to find the right size clip.2. Unit would not steam after 5 uses!3. Definitely a waste of money for me!
__label__2,"Nice Story: Well, I was sitting in the break room one day at work and happened across this book. Just the summary on the back got me interested, so I went home and bought my own. Turns out, it was quite a good story. I found the magic in this book to be very credible in the sense that if magic DID exist, this is probably HOW it exists.Secondly, Harry Dresden is dry, sarcastic, kinda dumb, kinda smart, and just my kind of guy. He's a good character and so are some of the others in the story. I'm looking forward to reading the whole series.The story isn't all that complex, and I'm sure it's covered well enough in other reviews. What I enjoyed the most was simply Harry's character. You can have all the best story in the world, but if the character isn't interesting then the story usually isn't interesting either. People who like characters of the build that I described will probably enjoy this book!"
__label__2,"Real music communicates: I never expected this CD to be this good. I bought this and ""The Very Best of Cat Stevens"" together. Honestly, several of the songs on ""An Other Cup"" are even better than the Very Best. The two albums are sharply contrasted though. In the Very Best, he is clearly a man searching everywhere to find his peace, and often in the wrong places. ""Hard Headed Woman"" really speaks to that. But in An Other Cup, you see a man who has finally found his place, and reaches spiritual enlightenment. This CD communicates so well his journey. It is sincere and uplifting, and makes me feel that there is hope in the world. 5 stars, hands down."
__label__2,"Great Sauce Pot: I bought the sauce pot to go with the set I have. It is the perfect size for pasta and it's easy to clean, nothing sticks to it. I prefer to hand wash my pots and pans anyway, so not putting them in a dishwasher is not a negative for me. Just remember when you buy Anolon cookware, always buy the advanced, and you won't be disappointing."
__label__2,"I love these books!: It was kind of disheartening to know there were no more Harry Potter books to come out, but then I found these books to replace them. They are fantastic! I can't wait for the fourth book and the movies to come out!"
__label__2,"Cute, Quaint, & Hungry: Daniel Harris shoots from the hip with thought-provoking insights on the psychological craving for kitsch. This is not the usual mocking ""grocery list"" of tasteless objects. It is a probe into the causes of the craving. A must-read for anyone tracing the dehumanization of Man in the Twentieth Century."
__label__2,"Not much to say: Mechanix gloves are pretty much always a solid purchase. This is the third pair I've bought, and they've all been good quality, etc. They're not the most protective gloves in the world (for that, look for the impact-resistant version), but they're very good, and certainly help handle issues with heat, and lack of grip."
__label__1,Delayed GPS: Computer: Dell XFROS: Windows XPSoftware: Delorme Street Atlas 2011This unit works okay. Not great. There is about a 1/4 mile delay in where the GPS unit says I am compared to where I physically am. I unhooked it and reverted back to my TomTom because it's much faster at telling me where I am. I use this for work and travel backroads/urban streets/interstates in KY and a lot of times the roads I'm on aren't marked.Overall I'm not happy with it. I went back to using my TomTom and this GPS unit now sits in my computer desk.
__label__2,"My daughter adores Prince: I purchased this CD for my daughter for Christmas. She adores Prince, so of course, she loves the CD. It's almost time for a new one. She has played this one every day since she received it. Also, the service from ecom.com was excellent!"
__label__2,"Great for hardcore Star Trek fans!: I have to say that this film would probably only appeal to the more intense Star Trek fans. I myself think it was great! Lots of humor, great acting, awesome special effects, everything that we've come to expect in Star Trek movies. However, the story was more of a classic Star Trek story, almost like something you'd see in a tv episode, which I don't think would appeal to many fans, but again it is most definetly a great Star Trek movie."
__label__1,"Not as good as ""Tipping Point"".: I thin-sliced the cover of ""Blink"" and thought it would be as good as Tipping Point by the same author.I was as wrong as the cops mentioned in the book, while this is not a big waste of time, I didn't get anything new from this book."
__label__2,"The Most Underrated Billy Joel Album: Unfortunately, this album was completely overshadowed by The Stranger, but in it's own way it proves that it belongs with that album as the high-water mark of Billy Joel's career. Don't get me wrong, I like the later stuff too, but this album shows the full songwriting capability of a great talent and, at least for me, the overall songs on this album are more thoughtful than on The Stranger. ""Summer, Highland Falls"", ""New York State of Mind"", and ""Prelude/Angry Young Man"" alone make this a good album. ""Say Goodbye To Hollywood"" and ""Miami 2017"" make it a great album. While most of these songs were re-released as live versions on Songs From The Attic, I prefer the studio versions simply because most of the subtleness is lost before a stadium full of people. This was one that I insisted on getting for my collection."
__label__2,"Excellent introduction to moving tantric energy.: This book has one core teaching, which describes a technique using masturbation to raise erotic energy, and bring it up to the heart (rather than release it in orgasm). Margo is very eloquent on the positive aspects of masturbation, and its benefits in our sex lives generally; she uses the practices in the book to successfully resolve issues in her life regarding relationships and food. It's an easy technique to adopt for beginning tantra practitioners, who may not yet be able to sense chi movement within their body - after 3 months, most everyone can.It's definitely the simplest beginning tantra practice guide I've yet seen, after reading avidly about tantra for several months. Good stuff!"
__label__2,"One of the best Hardware's for an Animator: I'm so glad to have bought this off ecom for three reasons. I got it cheaper than the price stated on the Wacom site, the shipping was free and I got it in 4 days from the day I bought it under the ""free shipping"" plan.Cintiqs are some of the best hardware floating around the market for animators and artists alike. With the real time feel of drawing right on the Screen and softwares that support the Wacom's pressure sensitive and tilt features, this is a boon to the industry.I would love to give this product a 5/5 for everything but I think it loses a star only because of its high price."
__label__2,"All I can say is WOW!: Everybody's good at something...and Denn has finally found out what he is good at...it's not soccer, playing the piano, or calculus...it's playing poker. Denn is so good he is winning thousands of dollars, buying expensive gift for his girlfriend and even cars, but his relationships with his friends, parents and his girl are becoming distant---cold. Denn is certainly raking in the cash, but is he trading money for the important things in life? A surprise ending will have you wishing Denn all the luck in the world...because he'll need it!This book starts rolling and never stops despite the pages stopping you'll be left with the thoughts and images forever.Do yourself a favor and read this book and watch a masterpiece of charactization unfold."
__label__1,"Bad writing: I agree with one other reviewer. After reading the good reviews, I decided I had to have this book. It is nothing but filth. It is way too long and is filled with.... Don't bother."
__label__1,"Am I missing stomething?: The characters are not likable, the story is boring, the writing, repititious--and he wins the national book prize! I could only read half of it, then skipped to the end. One reviewer wrote the mother somehow ""developed"". From what I read all characters were stuck and obnoxious and narcissistic. No thanks. Wouldn't want to spend time with any of these people or the book."
__label__2,"Risque Roald at his best!: Tantalizingly teasing and sexually seductive, thelascivious tales of Uncle Oswald will keep you enchantedas our hero hops from one bed to the next. Not only anentertainingly bawdy tale, but a prophetic commentary on the'sticky' world of human genetics and morality."
__label__1,"Navy Seals in Vietnam.: As if we don't have enough books about Special Forces in Vietnam, here is still another one. Dockery's writings do not have the flow, and this short book takes longer than needed. The reader gets information about some of the missions, equipment, and the Brown Water Navy. The Navy Seals did not contribute as much as the Marines and Army in Vietnam. Still we get another book about Special Forces."
__label__2,"Fantastic: Unfortunately, I didn't know about this series when it started. My parents started watching it and were hooked so I decided I must check it out. I have almost completely caught up on the first 2 seasons in a matter of a a couple of days. I am that hooked. I am afraid once I do get caught up I will have a hard time waiting for the weekly installation of the show. I've gotten used to watching one after the other. I love the characters, the costumes, the scenery, everything is fabulous and now I want to visit the house someday!"
__label__1,"Over-priced at $3.40: I am not against formula romance but really, give me something of a story. Help it unfold. How many paragraphs can be spent with the characters reliving/rehashing their ""unintentional"" hot sexual encounter. And whose baby sleeps through the night without ever waking up? And what new mother just hands her baby over to a college friend whom she hasn't seen for a long time. And what college friend is so free, kind, and independently wealthy that she has time to just hang out and watch this friend's baby. And why, when she writes a popular syndicated column does it matter if she doesn't go into the office. And why bring up that she and her boss have a lot of tension when it has nothing to do with the story. Please."
__label__1,"J.D. Robb is great--The others aren't worth the time.: If you are a fan of the J. D. Robb ""In Death"" series with Eve Dallas as the main character, then you will probably want to get this book just to read the short story featuring Eve Dallas by J.D. Robb. The other three stories will probably be an ever-increasing disappointment to you. The final story in this book was about a menage a trois and ended with absolutely no resolution of any of the plot points whatsoever. I rate it a complete waste of time and money. But I love Eve Dallas' character so I would have bought the book if only for her story."
__label__1,"Dissatisfied: I was very excited to get this splitter, but when it came and I tried it out on my Ipod touch,My apple headphones didn't properly work, it was a fuzzyish noise and was distorted. My other Sony ones worked fine, although you have to pull then out just a little to sound ok. Don't buy these. It's ironic too because it says that they were made for iPod. Stupid people at monster"

__label__2,"Expensive taste: As pointed out by many of the other reviewers this CD-album of Holly Cole is one of the best CD's you can buy if you like the fusion between pop (sometimes country) and jazz; as a singer she is one of the best in the genre, there is no doubt about that. I don't want to review every song into depth, but One Trick Pony, Ghosts and Same Girl stand out as wonderful depictions of the original, not strangely enough most reminiscent to the songs she did on Temptation. The accompinament is wonderful, also due to the stunning sound quality. But then there is one thing I was quite surprised about: the total playing time hardly exceeds 43 minutes! I think there is no excuse worthwhile to justify such minimal achievement at the expense of the buyer (this import CD is very expensive)!"

Now, if this is your first FM Transmitter and you have nothing else to compare it to, then you may think that it is wonderful! But trust me, with this product, you get what you pay for.

__label__1,"NOT chocolate: FALSE LIST OF INGREDIENTS: Extremely disappointed in this product. It barely tastes of cinnamon at all and is downright gross. My main complaint, however, is that it's not chocolate at all. It's a cake of sugar held together with dyed brown vegetable fat with a bit of cocoa liquor thrown in as an afterthought. Unbelievable that they market it as chocolate. And the list of ingredients on this product page conveniently leaves out the fact that it contains vegetable fat, which is clearly states on the package. It also does NOT contain cacao nibs, but rather cheap cacao liqueur. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS TRANS FATS in the form of manteca/vegetable fat, also known as hydrogenated oil or Crisco. Don't let the legal loophole of ""0 grams"" fool you."
__label__1,"Leaky Coffee Pot: We've had this pot for six months. In the first couple of months, the carafe started to drip water down the front whenever I used it to pour water into the reservoir. At least a cup of water would run down the front of the pot onto the counter. We sent in the pot and got a replacement. That one leaks, too. Also, it leaks water from under the machine. After making coffee, if you lift the machine off the counter, there is leaked coffee underneath. We have also had trouble with it not perking all of the water in the reservoir. Sometimes there is up to 4 cups of water left in the reservoir when it is done perking. When I go to fill the reservoir the next time (assuming it is empty) I have an overflow because of the left-over water that never perked. This pot is a disaster. Don't buy one. P.S. When we sent for the replacement thermal pot, Cousinart said that they would only replace it once....that should have been a hint that things wouldn't go well."

__label__1,"Classics in Translation: Pere Goriot is a great novel, though what I loved as a college student is not what I loved upon re-reading. As a younger reader I loved the sacrificial devotion of the father for his daughters. As a mature adult, I was disturbed, finding it what we now would call enabling and infantilizing.The characters are so well drawn, as are the times, the era, the city of Paris in all it's glory and misery. These are what make the book greatThe problem is the translations of many of these free books. They are translated by more than one person, and it's very obvious. Some sections are fine, others very poor and hard to follow. So we aren't getting a fair shot at reading the novel as it was written. It's too bad, because these erratic translations may turn some readers away from the classic,novels of the 18th and 19th centuries."
__label__1,"stinker-oo: The plot was stupid, and not very interesting. The ending was so predictable, I figured it out before the first scene ended. The romantic nature of the story was forced, and seemed totally unrealistic. The main character keeps crying, his retarded brother keeps saying cutesy twaddle that tugs at the heart strings, and the jock looks cute and uninvolved all through the picture. This stuff went out with Shirley Temple. The hour and ten minutes went by like three hours. The music track was just an exercise in cheap sentiment. Avoid this movie like the plague. BORING!"
__label__2,"Awesome: I have had this STEAMER for almost 10 years. Yes, I have replaced the clean water tank twice, but I still consider this an excellent machine. The STEAM comes from the HOT WATER you put in the tank. YEA, I boil the water I put in the tank so it doesn't bother me that I have to replace a $50 part once every 5 years. WHY would you use CARPET SOAP with a steamer? The hot water is what cleans and to really freshen my 6 dog house, I add some non foaming deodorizer to the clean water tank. If used correctly, the carpet is virtually dry by the time you finish. I ALSO use this steamer for non-carpeted areas. The spinning brushes work on any surface. I also use the hand attachment to clean upholstered seats. GREAT MACHINE."

Like so much fluff, it's insulting to audiences when musicians turn out an album just for the sake of getting one off. It's patronizing and I don't appreciate the insult. This CD is NOT one of those.Colbie Caillat manages to make a record that's easy on the ears. Yet, you can tell that she has something to say and she says it so well. I enjoyed the experience of letting her music speak to who she is as a person, as a singer, and as an artist. I may not know her personally, but I got an insight to the person behind the music."

I was sorely disappointed.First of all, Weird Al isn't really that funny. Sure, he's amusing in a sort of 'this is something the whole family can enjoy' sort of way, but he's not edgy and he doesn't take risks.Furthermore, he doesn't even really bother with most of these songs. I don't know if this is meant to be a genuine 'greatest hits' or a hilarious parody of the greatest hits format, but I'm shocked if it is, because a lot of these 'songs' are mish-mashs and melodies, with very little in the way of coherence or humour to recommend them.Anyone with a functioning sense of humour should look elsewhere. Perhaps there are better Weird Al albums, but I don't plan to waste any more money finding out.(The two stars are for the two chuckles I got from this)"

__label__2,"Sutherland is wonderful!: Beatrice di Tenda is one of Bellini's most under rated operas. It was written right after Norma and right before I Puritani, his two greatest masterpieces. Unfortunatly, after a poor reception at its opening it was never really given many chances to catch up with its sisters. It was only after Sutherland gave these historic performances in the early 1960's that the opera was re-born. Today it is a rare opera to hear but a treasure to listen to if ever given the opportunity. This recording is terrific, Sutherland is in top form. The only problem is the pace of this performance is too slow and just doesn't sound, to me, like true Bellini. Much better recording are with Joan Sutherland and Pavarti (1966 Decca). Or with June Anderson (opera d'oro 1987), either of these give Beatrice the proper seat beatween her sisters Norma and Elvira."

The author describes everyday scenes well and weaves a fascinating situation. Alas, however, I just can't suspend my disbelief quite that much. I just didn't find the outcome of the book to be realistic. I like a tear jerker as much as the next person but there is a point at which it has to make some amount of sense.

Sue Townsend's clever writing style makes even the worst situations seem hilarious. The best thing about this book is that it's very real. In other words, I think almost anyone can relate to Adrian's problems in one way or another. The only thing that I didn't like about this book is that it is very redundant. For example, it seems as if Adrian is complaining about the same problems page after page. It started to get old after awhile, but not enough to keep me from reading.

I was blew away by the new concept of heros. the hero is a super powered unit that can destroy entire armies alone if used properly. the hero starts at lvl 1 and can go to lvl 10. some heros can raise from the dead, summon powerful units, turn into demons and mch more. the 3-d graphics are nice and dont cause much lag. the game isnt expensive like most other games.by far the best part of warcraft 3 is battle.net. it is the FREE(yes, free!) online part of wc3. u can crush other opponenets or relax and play a fun custom game.so wat are u doing sitting there and reading my review? go get the game!!!!!!!"

At about a year, like some other people who wrote a review, the timer button broke. I had it repaired and now six months after that it just died completely yesterday. What an awful product that this company gets away with selling."
__label__2,"Learning Tools: I have only had the chance to peruse this book lightly thus far. From what I can see in the table of contents and thumbing through, the book covers most of the topics I'm interested in.

__label__2,At War With the Self & the World: Who is a poet? A wordsmith who is struggling to grow up. An artist who doesn't know her voice yet. A painter still looking for a signature. Kundera seems to know the poet in each of us; Life is Elsewhere is a genuine portrait of a confused young man at war with himself and the world. 10/10

I'm not giving it 5 stars because when it is close to being done it sounds like the motor is working really hard and sometimes it will stop turning if it's really think. I don't have any other ice cream makers to compare it to, but it would be nice if it would keep churning a little more to make the ice cream fluffier and get more air in it so it wouldn't be as hard in the freezer."

__label__1,Not too good.: This book wasn't that great because it was boring and didn't have that much imformation. It's scientific facts of the people wern't that good.
__label__2,Not bad for the price: These were cheap so I bought three so I would have one for each car and an extra. One of them was DOA but the other two have been working fine ever since. I obviously took price into consideration when giving four stars. I would be more inclined to give three and a half stars but that is not an option and if one of these units die I will probably buy two or three more so I rounded up.
__label__2,"Very thought-provoking: Deepak Chopra has been on Oprah many times. He is Indian and this book is one of many he has written with a metaphysical or New Age philosophy. Each chapter contains one lesson and begins with a story involving a young boy, Arthur, and a wise old wizard, Merlin. The rest of the chapter explains the lesson learned by the young wizard. For instance, talking about transformation, or making changes in one's life: ""You cannot bring your same stale self to the world and expect the world to be new for you."""
__label__1,"Don't waste your time: All the problems with the mystery genre are typified by this novel: pedestrian writing, plot holes big enough to fly a plane through, flat characterization, totally implausible motivations, and a basic premise that just doesn't make any reasonable sense if you pause long enough to think about it. If Highsmith is one of the ""stars"" of this field, mystery readers must have very low standards."

This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.At least it only cost me $20 oredering from ecom. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price."

__label__1,"racist propaganda: The cover of this book makes the author's intentions obvious, to permanently brand the German identity with guilt.Inside the covers, you will find much selective information that supports the author's thesis- but you won't find a sincerely objective effort to present the truth.One can't blame all the Muslims of the world for the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001, and neither can you blame ordinary Germans for everything that happened during WWII. How offensive that a personal vendetta against an entire people should be masked as academic research."
__label__1,"Pornographic and bad acting: This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I saw it once and I don't care about seeing it again. This movie is a little pornographic, to warn you. The acting was also terrible -- DeFoe tries to sound erotic when he was with Madonna but he sounds like he's acting (poorly) through the sex scenes. Madonna looks like she was about to laugh when she poured hot wax on the poor guy. The only thing I learned about from this movie is the S&M stuff....the other scenes I would just put in the trash because it was so bad. I don't recommend this movie to anyone at all."
__label__2,"Full size performance in sleek size: This little netbook is half the size of a normal laptop, and weighs hardly anything. I was really impressed with the Ubuntu operating system - don't be intimidated if you have never used linux before! It is super easy to get used to, and what is really awesome is the add/remove program tool. Instead of going to the computer store and buying programs, you just use this application to access literally thousands of programs to do anything, even great games - ALL ARE FREE!It operates silently, runs all sorts of programs quickly (3D games not so well), transfers data via USB faster than any other computer I have used, and the battery lasts almost 3 hours - though it was 3.5 hours when I got it a month ago. Everyone who sees this computer loves it too.When comparing stats to other little netbooks you will see that this is the best buy, and trust me - get the Ubuntu version and stop being a slave to corporate software giants!!!"

The only thing is my laminator is an ""Ibico"" - not a newer model and the cover for the laminating pouches was too thick to go thru. I still had the covers from a previous purchase and they worked just fine with these pouches. I definitely recommend these and the lower cost was great."

When reaching inside to clean it, the edge is not rolled so I am careful not to cut myself. It is not sharp, but it is not smooth either. The handle is awkward and the trigger to open the spout is not smooth, comfortable, or easy. Don't waste your money on this one."

__label__2,The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog: The book was very informative. This is a very complex and little-known breed. People need to be aware of what they are getting into when bringing a Catahoula into a suburban environment. This book was very helpful and straightforward.

It is a great idea and he enjoyed playing with it, BUT ... after a few hours of throwing the LAX ball at the targets it started getting holes in the tarp.

The second target had similar problems, although not as severe, when we unfolded it from the box."

Playback is sharp and clear with little distortion. Remote is still a bit confusing with no clearly marked enter key for menu selections. However, at for the price paid and the single deck for both DVD and VHS, this unit is tough to beat, over $... less than competitiors from GO-Video."

__label__2,"Broken Bow: I purchased these because the ones that came with my Bowflex broke after only a few uses. I was expecting this because of the reviews on the product. I think it's best to warm the rods up by bending them slowly with a 10-pound rod in a exercise, first. Apparently, like with most materials, the rods become more rigid when cool. I have the Bowflex in my basement and the average temperature in the Fall/ Winter is around 50 degrees F. The replacement rods have worked well and nothing has broken since."
__label__2,"spin selling: The book makes sense and is easy to follow. It is aimed at those selling long term services or making larger sales.

__label__2,"Kissing Jessica Stein: This film is about relationships, regardless of the genders of the participants. Jessica Stein is a neurotic young woman who can't seem to find a man worth the time to date, so she answers a personals ad placed by another woman. Right off the bat the viewer sees how quirky Jessica really is. She runs out on the first meeting.Without giving too much of the movie away, we see how this relationship finally develops then succumbs to what many couples, both gay and straight ultimately have to face, the loss of compatibility. The movie goes from highs to lows as these characters are developed into living, breathing people. I think it helps that the main actors also wrote the script. Almost anyone with a sense of humor or sense of romance will enjoy this film."
__label__2,"very pleased / good value for it's price range: I have many higher end, expensive knives with ice hardened steel that I cherish ...however, I was looking for a set of decent steak knives that wouldn't break the bank....AND keep a good edge. These are probably one of the best value per dollar items in their price range. Forged, hardened steel, (tho not ice hardened) a bolster and full tang...all at a reasonable price! I use a professional electric sharpener on all my knives....so I don't know if those of you with just a sharpening steel will have as good an edge lasting on ""your"" knives. Bottom line, from my position....I did a lot of research on reasonably priced steak knife sets that met the above conditions and after multiple months of usage I have no regrests with these knives. Do keep your knives in a wooden block and PLEASE hand wash and dry them quickly, remember to sharpen them regularly....if you follow these steps you will have many good years from all your knives."

Even if your gaming group pools together a few dollars each to buy this product, there will not be enough to go through more than a few characters. Save your money for the other products, instead."
__label__2,"Should you buy this?: Red rescue team is a pretty good game, but I myself prefer the classic type pokemon games like pokemon sapphire and leaf green. (As well as the Blue, Gold, etc.) Red rescue team is a different experience where you are the pokemon. It depends on several factors if you should spend your money on this item. Looking at other reviews, younger kids love this game. So it depends what age group you are getting this for. Kids under 11 ""can't put it down"" maybe that's a bad thing... I still gave it 4 stars, but would rather spend my money on the new pokemon game coming out for the DS. Another factor may be which handheld you have. DS~Blue and GBA~Red I only have red so I don't know any plot differences between the two."

__label__1,"Enough already.: While the plot is creative and the author sets some interesting scenes with great detail, this is a laborious read. I felt that the author was trying too hard to prove his brilliance to the reader.Many of the sentences were too complex and the language was inefficient. While that style is reminicient of literature of the era, it made tedious what could have been a dynamic storyline."

__label__2,"Required Reading for the Gates/Buffet Foundation: I hope the folks at the Gates Foundation have read this book before they embark on spending the $30 billion just donated by Warren Buffet. The charity has to reach grass roots ideas that the disadvantaged can implement on their own and bypass the Warlords and Dictators. Otherwise, we are just lining the pockets of the bad guys- and creating ill will and a culture of dependency in the process. The seemingly intractable problems of the third world will not be solved by more Live Aid concerts but by the intelligent, targeted investment. I want to thank Professor Easterly for advancing this vital discussion."

__label__1,"Overrated and simplistic: Ms. Orman treatment of financial matters are rather basic in this book. Only beginners will get much information. Some of the advice is somewhat inaccurate (for example, recommendations on taking on a 15 year morgage)."
__label__1,"It made no sense...: ...I watched it at school, and everyone in my class was either sleeping or scratching their heads in confusion. I just don't understand why Spielberg made this movie...along the way, people started talking in random languages (pardon me for being vague, I don't remember WHICH languages) and, well...it was just weird. Why did they? I have no idea. The ending just baffled me...*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship? HUH? Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it really made no sense to me. I was alternating between bored and frustrated at not understanding the 'plotline'.Quite a poor effort, conclusively...this movie was weak."
__label__2,great mattress: I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
__label__2,"almost but not quite: As JMT's production gets weirder, the rhymes get more banal. I feel like they reached their peak with Violent by Design...in psychosocial the production wasnt quite as slick and the lyrics were a little forced (too many sci-fi metaphors that didnt quite make sense). And this album has fallen into the trap of boring gangsta lyrics, with outright incongruous and wacky production. Not to say that the production itself isnt good, and wasnt specifically meant to contrast like it does...the only problem is it doesnt quite work. This is quite a good album, but more of a novelty piece. It's worth getting, but i certainly wont be listening to it over and over like Violent by Design."
__label__1,"Overrated: After reading many great reviews about this book I finally broke down and bought it, and it was a waste of my time and money. While the book is not dreadfull, it is certainly not good. I found the writing to be very immature and the story to be unimaginative. Sebold could have done a much better job on this story since it felt rushed and thrown together. The characters could have been developed much better, the best lines in the book are about the father and I wish that Sebold would have spent more time on this and the mother. Many reviews detail the emotion that this book evokes, and I just didn't feel anything remotely close while reading. This story could have been great, but the writing just falls flat. If you really want to read this wait until its on the discount shelf because it is not worth it now."
__label__2,sanitary and convenient: No more leaving the tent for a mad dash to the restroom in the cold dark of the night. These Travel Johns are so convenient! Now I can go in the privacy of my tent without spilling a drop. The urine gells instantly and there is absolutely no spilling and no odor. It can be used multiple times with no problem (just don't overfill--you'll know). I've been using these for years now and can't go car camping without them. The resealable ones are even better but cost much more.

__label__1,"Hey Coupland!: I was in shock as I was reading the rave reviews for this novel. I can't believe anyone enjoyed this book even half as much as Coupland's other novels. I've read all his books, fiction and non-fiction, and this is by far the least Coupland-esque book I've ever read. It was mundane and typical. I'll admit, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. And, that's saying something. I have to finish books. It's the OCD in me. I hate an unfinished book. But, this was just painful. I couldn't do it. Even the writing was different. I can appreciate the novel, even the worst books I can appreciate, but it is definitely the worst of Coupland's amazing collection."

__label__2,"Perhaps the best Crimson album ever: The sound quality of this box set isn't up to today's standards, but perhaps that's one of the things that makes it so great. Close your eyes, and you'll almost feel as if you were back in some sweaty venue back in the day of the Mellotron.With various gigs included in this set, one gets a sense of how the same songs changed from night to night. Particulary striking is the interplay between John Wetton's voice and bass. My favorite disc is the third one, with versions of the Great Deceiver, Nightwatch, and Exiles. Peace/A Theme segueing into Cat Food is excellent as well (and a dandy little surprise).The only reason I give the set four stars instead of five is some of the improvisational numbers. But then, even when Crimson fails in its overindulgence, they seem to do so in an interesting way.The most human and powerful live album ever produced."
__label__2,"Hume: This was great. It was a short work, about 50 pages, but contained some great philosophy herein. Natural Religion has fascinated me, and this work helped me work through some issues"
__label__1,"Same old story: I concur with the criticisms already posted, but add one more. Light Before Day is but one more in a long, and very tired, line of gay lit that focuses on the travails of gay pretty boys living the life. Narrow, self-centered, and blessed with stylish, if not always high-paying jobs, these characters are always expected to pique our sympathy as they bemoan their plight. Violins, please.News flash! Most gay folks don't live in the ghetto (who can afford it?), have great jobs, or stop traffic when they walk down the street. Yet they hardly exist in most books about ""our"" community (whose?). How much of this stuff must we wade through before we find a Jim Grimsley or Joseph Hansen?I note Rice now lives in West Hollywood. Not encouraging."
__label__1,"Will not last very long: When I first recieved these sheets, I loved them. They are quite soft. They've been washed twice now, and the seams are starting to come apart on the fitted sheet and pillowcases.

__label__2,"Shows how strong friendships can be!: The Broken Hearts Club is a black comedy about a group of single gay men trying to find love and happines in the world. The chracters are warm and funny adn can easily be compared to yourself. As each of these characters broken up or single the other friends are there for him. When one of the characters begins to drugs and has a DO, they all come to the hospital to support him. This is not a movie with sex and nudity at all. Its a story of friend ship and being there for each other."

__label__1,"Don't drop it: I bought the Victorinox AAA LED flashlight as a Christmas gift for my 8-year-old son. As the other reviewers noted, it has a very bright beam. My son really enjoyed the gift and found MANY uses for it. However, after two weeks it stopped working when he dropped it on our hardwood floor. As best as I can tell, something broke in the bulb assembly. Since I can't find a replacement bulb, I am going to have to send it back to the mfr - too much hassle for a $10 product."

__label__1,"disgusting: The point of this movie is the opposite of what it purports to be. `Bang Bang You're Dead' was clearly designed to pollute innocent minds. It pretends to have a morally uplifting message. But nothing could be further from the truth. In case you are nave about what is going on in the world; there is a network of criminals who control the media. This network of criminals is focused on corrupting the minds of innocent children. They are trying to create chaos in the world. This movie, among other things, is telling children that one possible reaction to being bullied at school is to kill people. These criminal filmmakers get away with this type of message by pretending to say, ""Killing people is a bad idea."" In reality, the point of the film is to put the idea into the minds of children that killing people is an option.Putting this type of imagery into the mind of a child is criminal behavior. ""Teachers"" who are having their students watch this film should be arrested for child abuse. Word"
__label__2,"Quite possibly the best soup book ever: With recipes like New Zealand Sweet Potato Chowder, Moroccan Lamb Stew, Cuban Black Bean and Mulligatawny with Lentils the Daily Soup takes us on a world tour with our taste buds. I've owned this book for over 10 years and each of the dozens of recipes that I have tried turns out perfect without any need to adjust ingredients or add a dash of anything to complete it. Some recipes require ingredients not found in your local grocery store, but a trip to a specialty store for the missing ingredient is worth it! Believe me the Authors know what they are doing, you will taste the difference!If you love soup, then this is the perfect companion!"

A book Every Human should Read!: This book means a lot to me beacause it's a true story and I have to say that I am in love with Joseph Merrik(Jhon) There are no words to express my love for that man, he was perfect on the inside and thats the truth. I read a book and saw pictures of him, and I felt no disgust, only horror at the pain in his eye's, he was really mistreated!Those pictures haunt me to this day!"

The ""Tap and Go"" version is a handy feature, but these things are such junk it doesn't matter.The ""hydraulic"" or ""pneumatic"" slowing of the door only takes place in the last 25% of the piston stroke. By that time it has slammed into your ass (okay) or your ankle (which hurts like hell and bruised my son in when he had bare feet.Carried by both Home Depot and Lowes, they are complete junk. Not sure what the alternative is ... but avoid Wright!"
__label__1,"Great idea but poor quality: I am surprised that this product made it to the market. It is a great idea, but the end result is extremely dissappointing. The first luge I ordered was delivered broken in the box. ecom promptly sent a new luge and it shattered after the first use. The flimsy plastic that it is composed of does not stand up to the freezing and thawing. You are better off ordering an ice luge from your local ice company."

Had to buy it so if computer crashed all the cd's were in a nice spool. For those unaware of EverQuest you are better off sitting around burning your cash and punching yourself in the face.
__label__2,"Something smells in here....: The power of this fan is great, the design is great, I really like how high it is off the ground. It will keep you cool. But when I got mine it stunk. For weeks it stunk. It had a burning plastic or maybe some kind of burning lubricant smell after it had been running for awhile. It was really bad and really annoying considering I paid a hundred bucks for a smelly fan. I was so ticked off I put the fan out on the back porch with my dogs and left it running on high for a week straight. I was just going to leave it outside but I thought I would check and see if the smell had finally worn off and it had. So now the fan is back in my workout room where it belongs and it no longer smells like its burning. Maybe I just got a overly lubed fan or something because I didn't see anyone else mention this problem. So anyway its a really great fan but if yours stinks put it outside for a week or so and it should be fine."

__label__1,"More New Yorkers being New Yorkers: This book follows along the lines Bridget Jones seeems to have set up. What bothered me most was Mr. Wolcott's tiring, annoyingly,repeatedly over use of absurd adjectives and adverbs as he comesdown from his Vanity Fair heights to write for the masses. I foundmyself distracted from the storyline itself by this. Not reallyworth bothering to read."
__label__1,"anticlimactic: A couple of my coworkers went on and on about how amazing and terrifying this book was, so I was super excited to read it. The story of Johnny Truant was the most interesting part for me. The story of the house itself was overly illustrative which bored me half to death. Then, it just seemed to end. I was super disappointed."

__label__2,"Very good Larry David movie pre-Curb.: Years before Curb your Enthusiasm, and at the end of his Seinfeld run, Larry David creates a movie typical of his style. If you are a fan of Curb, and or a true fan of George, then you will appreciate this movie. It contains some quintessential Larry David-type moments, including those uncomfortable parts. Literally the first-half of this movie seems rather boring, perhaps it takes long to set-up the plot and establish characters. But the second-half is when we see a free-wheeling movie without those first-half encumbrances. You can see some of his Curb humor already in this 1998 movie. ""Having said that,"" it is not a great must-have movie, but still worth it for the low purchase price."
__label__2,"The Mavericks play ""country"". Don't hold this against them.: Speaking as a pop music fan who does not appreciate the kinds of music known as either the old ""country and western"" or the new ""new country"" (a genre that manages to simultaneously offend both rockers and country fans, all while causing label management to drool over the crossover demographics), let me say this about The Mavericks' ""Music For All Occasions"": Wow. Maybe it's ""new country"", maybe it's something else. Either way, I won't rehash others' comments about how great Raul Malo is as a singer/songwriter; I won't dwell on how tight the band is; I'll even forget my distaste for country music! I will instead advise that anyone with a taste for well-crafted, well-arranged, well-played and well-sung pop music (ok, with a slightly Latinized country flavor) do what I did: 1. Give this CD a spin. 2. Try to stop humming."
__label__2,"The best of the Derita features...: While I'm not wildly enthusiastic about the Joe Derita features, this is a good, solid movie. Don't go in expecting anything close to the masterpieces turned out during the stooges heyday making the short subjects with Curly and Shemp, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.The movie starts off well in the opening with the boys preparing Mr. Fogg's breakfast and some of the reused routines like ""pop goes the weasel"" and the ""maharajah"" routine are pulled off well in this feature. I especially enjoyed Curly-Joe's sumo wrestling rematch with the mighty Itchy-Kitchy.Overall, a pleasant 90 or so minutes and the best of the Stooges 1959-1960s features."
__label__1,"so so: I have this and I find it better for the attachment aspect than the carpet cleaning feature. It just doesn't seem to do much as a carpet cleaner. If you have spills on chairs or using it on car seats, it does a fair job. But cleaning carpets I am not impressed. It gets it wet, it tries to suck it up, but doesn't exactly clean, and the feature on it I hate is is pools water after you shut the thing off underneath, so you have this mess of a spot to deal with. So is why I rated it low. I have the bissell old type of canister carpet cleaner that is awesome. It has plastic parts that you can't get anymore, which is sad. But that outcleaned anything. You could saturate the stains and it would pull out the stain and the water used..."
__label__1,"TIP OVER DANGER!!!: Like most of the other reviewers we loved this stroller when we bought it. It was great for maneuvering around tight areas, especially small elevators! Curbs and bumpy sidewalks were no problem. My son just turned 2 and is 3 feet tall. He still fits well in the stroller but as he has grown it has become more and more unstable. With the brakes locked and the stroller sitting on a flat surface it has TIPPED OVER TWICE AND NEARLY TIPPED OVER A THIRD TIME! All while my son was strapped in!! The last time my son hit his head on the concrete!! He could have been seriously injured!! The wheel base is just too short for the height of the stroller. Add a toddler reaching out of it and you have a potentially very dangerous situation!! I gave it two stars because it worked great when he was a baby. It was just what we needed. Now, it's another piece of junk taking up space in our garage!!"

__label__1,"""B-Movie"" that stands for ""BAD"" movie: Easily the worst film I have had the misfortune to buy for some time. As SciFi, the premises of the movie stinks...the year is 2175, we have the technology to change a planet's atompshere but we are still using guns and dynamite? The acting is worse than typical B movie acting and frankly, I found it closer to performances I saw in my younger days when the principals wore less clothes and had a reason to make the film.RENT this baby before you drop any cash on it!"
__label__2,"A FABULOUS ALBUM!!!: Forget the know-nothings that enjoy bashing the big Mac, this is one of Sir Paul's finest albums -EVER-! Great tracks with a highly charged emotional edge, stylistically this album goes from strength to strength. Rinse the Raindrops is likely Paul's hardest rocking track since Helter Skelter! Pure bliss. Also forget the lackluster sales that merely point to a public infatuated with disposable pop. This album is a keeper and will be hard to find in any 2nd hand shop! I give a big tip 'o the hat to Paul for this magnificent effort!"
__label__1,"Not very insightful: All this test does is ask you to choose between a bunch of adjectives and preferences, and it summarizes what you've chosen, adding a few minor qualities. It's nice of Kiersey et al (what happened to Ms. Bates in the second edition?) to gather this information for us, but it hardly qualifies as some great source of insight."
__label__1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read: This book was just bad. When I first heard about The Wind Done Gone I thought it was a great idea. Then I read it. Ms. Randall's writing was bad and it isn't worth the money. How did this get published? I'm a historian and love to read historical fiction but I was unable to finish this VERY thin book. It was dull and dry. I would suggest Cane River which is a great book. Please don't buy this.
__label__1,Watch out its a scam!: This video is very mis-leading and sensationalized. The 'concrete' evidence of the ark loaction is created using divining rods! Ron Wyatt is known to the Christian community as a liar and a con artist who took tons of money from interested supporters and gave back nothing but lies. Search his name on christianitytoday.com if you want to know more. But his video is terrible!

__label__1,"Bland and boring: Remember when Janet Jackson actually used to *sing* on her CDs? With words you could make out and sing along to? (""Come on baby, let's get away/ save our troubles for another day..."") I've been a huge Janet fan since the late 80s and have loved most of the stuff she's done in the last 15 years.Unfortunately, on this CD, Janet has continued the sad trend she began with ""All for You"" -- she almost never SINGS. Instead, we get seductive lyrical whispers on nearly every track. There are only 2 or 3 songs on the entire CD that I could actually hear what she was saying without having to look the lyrics up.Some of the songs on this CD have a lot of promise... a few have really great beats that really make you want to dance, and they could be gold with another artist like Beyonce, who isn't afraid to use their voice. But honestly, unless you're a hardcore fan, I would skip ""Damita Jo."""

__label__1,"My heart bleeds when I hear this album...: Ok, Scott was gone forever, before reaching his full potential. Everyone thought tha band was history. But then they come with the masterpiece ""BACK IN BLACK"" and a new ""screaming"" singer in the form of Brian Johnson. SOme people think the material to Back in Black was composed while Bon was alive. In truth, you can almost close your eyes and imagine Bon singing that tunes. IT would fit perfectly. The same is not truth for the albuns that followed. Johnson was getting worse and worse in the vocal department. Then the quality of the songs and lyrics deteriorated amazingly. This FLY ON THE WALL was the first sign of the end of their creative genius. Of course, being AC/DC, it has strong moments, simple and heavy chords. But the general effect is disgraceful."
__label__2,"Great Winter Boot: Ok, I live in Minnesota where it has been -10 for about the last 3 weeks. I spend lots of time out on the ice, ice fishing and these have kept my feet nice and toasty warm. They are a bit on the heavier side, but it's nothing I can't deal with. They stick to the ice great, like I'm walking on cement, and they are the warmest boot I have ever worn. Can't wait to use these for some hunting next fall! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend them."
__label__1,"TERRIBLE: Where to begin? They butchered the story, left out key characters, the animation is of such low quality that the 1980s GIJOE cartoon looks like animation masterwork by comparison, the CG characters are poorly animated. The list goes on and on.If there was a zero star rating -id give this movie that. A complete bastardization of the novel with iconic moments happening in the wrong location, major characters being left out of the story and even a romance that makes no sense between two formerly unrelated characters.This movie takes the heart and soul of Dragonlance - the characters of the Heroes of the Lance - and spits in their face. What a tagic disapointment at all levels.The voice acting here is wasted - Keifer Sutherlans, Lucy Lawless et al - so hard to emote when your characters facial expression never changes.Avoid this one at all costs"
__label__2,"iRiver player pretty good, got screwed by ecom: I have no complaints with the iRiver h10, except for the fact that sometimes it forgets that I've charged it.

So now I have to buy it out of my own pocket, cause they have expressed no interest in sending me a new one. The thing about forgetting it was charged: every once in a while, it'll charge overnight, and when I try to play it, it'll still be dead."

__label__1,crapped out after 90 days: Hard drive stopped working after 3 months. Camera connections are sloppy and as a result the unit often loses the video signal. Likewise the ac input is sloppy and if bumped the unit loses power. The cameras work fine but the DVR function is apparently very cheaply made with an inferior hard drive. I do not advise buying and I would not buy again.Update: I replaced the hard drive and all is fine - likely they are using cheaper hard drives - since I replaced the hard drive it has been working fine 24/7.

Based on the majority of reviews being positive, I can only assume that it just doesn't work on smooth coats. My dog was clean and brushed out prior to trimming, but I had to repeatedly go over and over his coat. It still isn't even but I needed to stop since he was getting irritated. It shouldn't take this much effort to make a pair of clippers cut the hair properly. I am returning after 1 use."

A bit weird on the street at times but nothing i'm not used to having driven with non gas charged shocks before.If your main use is street, grab the bilistiens or RS9000's, for a cheaper, decent trail first street second shock these are decent."

__label__1,"Insipid: At over 300 pages, this debut novel by John Dunson reads like a hopscotch game. Numerous characters, plots and sub plots jumping all over. It is hard to keep up with the story line as no character was clearly developed. From the prolouge we jump 5 years, with the entire story crammed into a 24 hour day. Every other chapter a new character is introduced, without the connection to the previous characters being made clear.There is a sentence in the story that says ""He never knew where he would be from one day to the next."" I had the same ambivalent feeling about the book, I did not know where it was going from one page to the next.Mr. Dunson gave us numerous secrets, lies and murders to be the makings of a great mystery, but did a poor job of tying then together into a readable story. Wonderful creativity, horrible writing and editing. The story just kept going and going. With the sequel Day Two, I can only hope Mr. Dunson makes it clearer.Reviewed by Toni Bonita, APOOO BookClub"
__label__1,"What happened here?!: Oh Disney! You make some true jewels, and then there's Cinderella II. Plastic, short- sighted, half-hearted. My friend and I, big Disney fans, were excited to see this, but by the end were incredibly embarrassed that we had watched it, and for the people who made this thing. Dismal stories, so-so animation, and shameless exploitation of a classic with a few poorly-done silly antics scenes to brainwash the kids into liking it. Cinderella's voice sounded stiff and fake, like the actor was trying to hard, not sweet and genuine heart- of- gold like the first.They should have cut the first two stories and put more effort into developing a decent story out of the third, about Anastasia falling in love. AND, learned from their omission in the first Cinderella and made the Prince a more 3-d character!Come on Disney! Your adult fans should be celebrating your works, not feeling ashamed of them!"
__label__1,"Cussler has Bottomed Out !!!: I have been a fan of Cussler's books since first reading ""Raise the Titanic"" in the 60s, but this one was painful to listen to.Some books are not meant to be on audio, and this was one of them. If I had to head about ""sapphire blue eyes"" or ""cornsilk hair"" one more time I thought I would scream...and the descriptions of women's clothing were ridiculous.The episodes in this book seemed to exist in isolation and have little to do with each other beyond the most tenuous connection. The editing was poor and the story itself was contrived and formulaic. The ending was pitiful.Cussler's books always have some kernel of reality in them, something that MIGHT happen if scientific research were to allow it. But the things in this book that were happening were just plain silly.....the oil filling (via some weird transference) an otherwise-empty briefcase once every few hours! AS IF !!!!I think it is time for Dirk Pitt to retire and try to keep some of his former dignity."

The design is very cute but the material is like tissue it's so cheap. The worst part were the ears. I read a review that they were small, and I thought that meant that the ears were like pictured just teeny round ears. In fact, the ears look NOTHING like the picture. The are seriously two humps that are about an inch high. Not circles, more like flat hills. I'm not exaggerating. Had to return it because it was $26, but if I saw it in person first I wouldn't have paid more than $5. I'm really surprised that Disney sponsors this outfit. They must have forgotten to look at the ears, or else they wanted to make sure that parents would have to go to the store to buy ones that aren't as ridiculously inadequate."
__label__2,"Good value for the price but...: While I think the fan works well for the lost cost of the unit but I really wish I had just spent the extra money on a better unit. The power is okay but weaker than most square box fans. Also, not having a remote is really an inconvenience, especially since it does not have a sleep mode. If you want a good fan that's a real space saver and is inexpensive, I'd recommend the DY-012"
__label__1,"Might was no Spy and Eggers is not worth the time: This falls into the general i'm-20-something-and-becoming-an-adult-pity-me category that is well worn and better executed by others.

__label__2,"Another satisfying read from P.C. Cast: As usual, Ms. Cast delivers a novel that is as satisfying as a massage and just as decadent.With her lush underworld landscape and smart, interesting heroine, Ms. Cast beautifully depicts the story of gourmet bakery owner, Lina, who finds herself body-switched with the Goddess Persephone and caught in the underworld with the sexiest incarnation of Hades that I've ever read about.Exquisitely imaginative imagery and clever twists on classic Greek mythology make Goddess of Spring a keeper, and P.C.

The typos aren't simply misspellings, but rather references to methods that don't exist, incorrect references to return values, etc. The code snippets will pull variables and custom classes out of thin air without any introduction. The only saving grace (and the thing which has kept me from burning it) is that it is a _decent_ refresher on design patterns if you already know them. However, you'd be better off rereading the canonical ""Design Patterns"" book. Maybe this should be one star..."

Relates to PowerPoint without making it the central topic (which, of course, it's not). Draws on experience in hitech, as well as rhetorical skills from the ages. I can only quote Weissman himself, ""If a presentation is worth doing at all, it's worth doing well."""

I have used electronic deterrents and found them to be unreliable. With a yard FULL of Hostas, deer think the table is spread and I soon have only stems. Since using Liquid Fence the Hostas are full and beautiful; plus the deer are not harmed. WAY TO GO LIQUID FENCE!"
__label__1,"It doesn't include the charger!: This is terrible! With a price of ..., you'd think it includes the charger as well, but instead it tells you to use the charger that came with your phone. So it will work fine as a sync cradle (albeit an ... one), but now I need to spend MORE money to be able to both charge and sync my phone at work and at home. Very disappointed..."
__label__2,"Cooks impossible rice.: This rice cooker has successfully cooked rice, mixed wild and brown, which we have never been able to cook before. It sputters a bit and takes a while, but it works great! Several years later, it still works great. To keep it from sputtering, use filtered water. I suspect that this will also work for other rice cookers too."
__label__2,"I couldn't put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable."
__label__2,"Good compilation for the money.: If you know the 'traveling troubadour's' life story, and where his music came from, as well as how his music dovetailed, buy this. After you listen to all the songs, you'll still buy the Baer compilations."
__label__2,"Saves money: Bought due to ratings and it is worth it. Just bought my 2nd filter, in fact I have it set on automatic shipment in 2 months and I get like a $2 discount. I recall reading 10000 gallons or 3 months until replacement. Since I'll never be able to measure 10000 gallons 3 months sounds good, except I use it a lot and noticed at about 2.5 months that water was tasting like tap so I'd say every 2 months is good."
__label__1,"The Worst Kitchen Tool I've Ever Used: What a poorly designed device. The plunger makes it virtually impossible to rinse lettuce thoroughly, then it leaves the lettuce too wet after spinning. To top it off the spinning mechanism stripped after the third or fourth use. This thing is such total garbage that it's hard to believe it's made by KitchenAid."
__label__1,"Save your money.: I bought this unit to replace my old one which I use to play my ipod in my car. Right out of the box, sound quality was garbage. Very echo-y and for some reason the sound was not evenly and appropriately distributed between the left and right channels. It also had a delay between he left and right channels. I went out and got the Monster 800 adapter from target for $18 and it sound way better. You get what you pay for."
__label__2,"Pleasent Surprise: I have had this story for a while and have recently started reading it to my daughter. The real surprise was that one of my favorite and most talented authors was the writer! This is a great ""bed time book"" for all children. My daughter ""sings"" the story with me.As always, I was VERY impressed! The art is simple yet elegant and fits perfectly with the overall theme.I call this another win.Thank you to BOTH Savas!"
__label__2,"Great Beauty Book!: I really like the K.I.S.S. Guide to Beauty. It has a lot of good information in it.I also have the K.I.S.S. Guide to Weight Loss, too. I would recommend these two and think their other books in the K.I.S.S. series would be worth checking out."
__label__2,"Everything is funny, but Stan.: You'd have to go pretty far to find a more devoted Laurel and Hardy fan than I, but as I watched this great collection I realized that Stan wound up exactly where he belonged, behind the camera. The gags are funny, but they could have been done by any other able bodied comedian of the time. He HAD no character, and that is precisely the problem. I still gave this set 4 stars because the prints are gorgeous, the films are fun, and they are definitely worth preserving (KINO does an amazing job). My only negative comment has to do with Stan himself...who, if he wanted to continue as a performer, really needed Ollie a lot more than I'd realized. As for Ollie, well, he more than likely would have continued as a wonderful comic supporting character actor, just as Eugene Pallete did (another Roach veteran)."
__label__1,"Don't Waste Your Money: I am a 58 year old female who loves Michael Jackson. I have tapes from way back, albums, CD's and DVD's. THIS IS THE BIGGEST RIP OFF OF MJ PRODUCTS I HAVE SEEN SINCE HIS DEATH. ecom should refuse to sell it. It looks like cell phone footage of nothing much and some of the funeral that everyone saw on TV, but not all of the best parts. NO MUSIC of MJ's, probably were not given permission. This is the biggest waste of money, even if it's not that much money. I trashed it. Don't waste your time or money. There are so many other good DVD's to buy, and I'm sure more to come."

__label__1,"Another example of a fine series with unrealized promise.: SimCity 3000 had every opportunity in the world to be a correction on the mostly misguided SimCity 2000. Unfortunately, it succeeds mostly at making one want to play that earlier game again. Better designed overall, the simulation model has grown so complex that the game is nearly unplayable. It is extremely difficult to effectively get your city underway, and the available help functions in the game are not sufficient to explain the complex theories of economics that the game requires you to understand in order to effectively govern your city. When SimCity was still about being the mayor of a city instead of showing you just what feats of computing are possible, it was a much stronger game. Until Maxis gets that idea back, SimCity 3000--for all of its good points--is just simply not worth playing."

__label__2,"No more cleaning!: I liked The Wash because it simply states the complex and painful results of a marriage.Nobu and Masi are newly separated after 40 plus years together. They are in new territory though still attached, as Masi keeps washing Nobu's clothes even 13 months after separating. Clearly they are tied into each other, but how much is love and affection and how much is tradition and familiarity?This is a terrific ""little"" play about a family, not requiring much to produce. Occasionally beautiful, poignant and funny. Also a play about the advent of modern adaptation. Some beautiful Japanese lullabys too."
__label__2,"Very nice, keeps the shower clean: We keep it in our shower and wipe down the glass when we're done using it for the day. I think it's really helped to keep the glass looking clean (it helps that we paid ""out the wazoo"" for the glass). DO NOT use it on tile and other rough surfaces unless you like burning money. It will get moldy readily due to the close spaces between the blades, but it does clean up nicely in the dishwasher in the ""silver"" drawer."
__label__1,Difficult transition from Quicken for Windows: It is very difficult to convert a Windows Quicken file to a Mac version. One must manually change account and category names to no more than 15 characters in length. No automatic utility is provided to do this. So a considerable time investment is required to convert your files to Mac use. Don't expect Quicken to work like MS Word or other programs that can read files written on Mac and PC versions. I plan to keep my old PC and run the Windows version until the Mac version is cleaned up.
__label__1,"Mis-representation: I just received my new Delta Platinum Edition 36-485 table saw and needed someway to collect dust generated by the table saw and was about to buy item DC001. Thanks to the reviews, I learned that this item will not fit my new saw even though the mfg and writeup by Tool Crib would lead you to believe otherwise. This mis-representation should be corrected. There is a need for this type of collection system as the metal chute that comes with the Delta saws is totally unsat for use in a workshop."
__label__1,"VERY DISAPPOINTED!: After using Tupperware products nearly all my life, I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am with this product AND with the customer service I received from the company.I purchased this item directly from Tupperware. I followed the directions that say ""top rack dishwasher safe"". After one washing, I closed the container, and could not open it againt unless I used a screwdriver to force it open. Why? Because the clasp warped in the dishwasher!Tupperware will not replace items that melt or warp. They didn't care that I followed their washing/care instructions. They said they'd sent me a replacement set, IF I gave them five dollars for shipping. Why would I want another set it the same thing is going to happen to them in the dishwasher?Unless you want to wash these by hand constantly, and unless you want to pack a screwdriver in your kids lunch box so they can pry their sandwich out, this product is truly useless."
__label__2,"Nostalgia at its best: This album is so fun. Whenever I listen to it, I smell crayons. It brings back memories of my early years. Also, the album content has two faces, presenting adult issues (relationships, love, heartache, etc.) from the eyes of a little kid. I love it.PS Check out the boy least like to's version of George Michael's ""Faith"" on their website. It's super-fun too."
__label__2,"AMAZING!!: I have heard a lot of new music, but this CD is PHENOMENAL. There are nine tracks, and this is the first CD I have heard in years where EVERY SINGLE SONG is good! I have listened to this disc over and over again for over a week and I love it more and more every time I hear it. If you like good, catchy music with a melodic feel and smart lyrics... you won't go wrong with this disc."

__label__2,"How to grow a Xenophile: This book is a light-hearted examination of important issues in American culture. In Star Trek, we see racism, sexism, career choices,and pretty much anything else you would ever need to know, explored.We aren't always given the pat answer - indeed, part of the vision is that we never reach perfect unity.With Kirk's crew we meet new races - and forget that we ARE different races. We cease being black, white, yellow or red and attain the wonderful experience of being Human."
__label__2,"The Beginning of Snoop Dogg.........: This CD is really good. It's a mix between gangsta rap and g-funk. Guests include The Lady Of Rage, Warren G, Nate Dogg, and the rest of the Dogg Pound. Highly recommended for Snoop fans. One of my favorite rap albums I have! Buy the one with 13 tracks, the 18 track one's extra tracks are skits."
__label__1,"5-stars to 1 star in 2 weeks: When my cutting board arrived and I began to use it, I was very satisified with it's size, looks, functionality, etc. That was my opinion when it first arrived -- and for about 2 weeks thereafter. Then the board began to warp. It is still usable, but it has gone from a 5-star item to a 1-star dud. I am very disappointed and am looking for a replacement."
__label__2,"Nightmare before Christmas: Tim Burton does it again! I don't know why it is listed as a Christmas movie, I would think more of a Halloween movie, could be both I suppose. Awesome!!!"
__label__2,Forgiveness: This book is great. Cheryl Wolverton does an excellent job delving into how tough it is sometimes to forgive ourselves and others. She also shows how pride keeps us from connecting with other people. It is a beautiful story about how God can work out the best in people's lives.
__label__1,"Skip It: There is a need for such a ""tool"". No Latin person speaks as slowly as this CD presents the words. The idea is good,but it needs much improvement before it can be really useful for a person in the construction industry."
__label__1,Don't waste your money: I bought this gate because I run a home daycare and I have an extra-wide doorway that I need to close off. The gate quality is really good but the latch and lock system is terrible. I have children that are year and a half old and they figured out how to unlock and open the gate about a week after I installed it. So unless you plan on using it for pets I would not waste the money on this one.
__label__2,"5 star *bump*: After reading other reviews, there really isn't much for me to add other than my vote for 5 stars. Just starting book 3, and think I'm enjoying this as much as Game of Thrones. I think I might end up liking it more, as this author doesn't seem to suffer the writer's block that 'ol RR.Martin does."
__label__1,"Choppy writing style, corn-ball characters: I must've been really young when I read ""Circle of Friends"", or I just can't tolerate this kind of writing anymore. Maeve Binchy does a decent job of describing people and their surroundings, but as soon as dialogue appears, and we enter the characters minds, I couldn't help thinking ""People just DON'T talk and act this!"" A little too un-believable, especially considering the seriousness of the main character's dilemma. Typical of 'romance novel' writing styles."

Can the other hot chick steal her boyfriend, formal dances, etc., etc.The twist is that she now suspects her boyfriend Peter may be Spider-Man, and the hero himself does show up in tights a couple of times.There are actually two of these it seems, and this is the second, presumably the first is how they got to be in the same school in the first place."
__label__2,"A good resource: There are other checklists available for those homeschooling parents who want to know what they might need to teach their children. You can even find some of these checklists on line. The ""what your child needs to know in.."" series will also help.What sets this one aside is it also covers character education and has check lists for what you might need to teach your child at different ages in character education and Biblical education.One of the things that I liked is that there was a place to write each child's name and youc an easily track what your children know at each level up to three children. Another thing I liked was that the checklists seperated out by grade were also seperated out by Character/Biblical Principals vs. State expected checklists. This made it easy to concentrate on just one thing if you wanted to do so.The only complaint I had was that it stopped at 8th grade. I would like to see another book along these same lines with 8-12th grade.Enjoy."
__label__2,"Continuing to blow my mind: The Hip blends intricacy, energy, and emotion into World Container. Songs like ""The Lonely End of the Rink"" really get you pumped up but have emotional untertones if you ever stop headbanging and take a listen to the lyrics. Gordon Downie's poetic fervor never ceases to amaze me. Fun tunes like ""In View"" and ""The Drop Off"" keep you going through the slower quieter tunes in between. My favorite parts are the syncopated lyrical rhythms of ""Family Band"" and the sheer energy of ""The Lonely End of the Rink."" A great addition to your Hip collection."
__label__1,Could you make a good even worse?: There has to be better books than this. Every third word is a contraction. i have no problem with them persay except should we use them all the time? besides the teacher who is teaching my class (Steve Gerson) wrote the book so it seems like a way for him to make money on the side and the ability to make the students use his book. His content on web pages should have been left out because its outated. Overall try not to use this book.

Warner Brothers asked the group to record a cover album of the hits of day, although the record company had acquired the Brummels' complete recorded output - released and unreleased - after Autumn faltered. There was enough original material recorded that would have filled an excellent third album.My advise for completists: Buy it when you already have everything else."
__label__2,"delightful!: I am not overly concerned with which version of P&P inspired the drawings, I simply wanted to be able to enjoy the outfits. I am pleased with the detail and quality of these paper dolls."
__label__2,"How could this have happened???: This nonfiction story intertwines the building of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago and it's architects with the life of a sick seriel killer. The story is filled with interesting and complicated details regarding both, and knowing that it is based on real facts makes it even more intense. What an interesting way to learn about history and some of the best and worst men in it. Really worth reading and I could hardly put it down."

Don't expect to do much drying with it. Another thing, the dye is cheap and you can see some running."
__label__2,"This is one of the best movies from the late '80s: It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film. At first, it looks like an 80's attempt at a date movie, but this one goes much further than that. It has a captivating plot, likable characters, and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Even though I'm not a fan of musicals or dancing, I still found myself enjoying this story. If you are a fan of Saturday Night Fever, you will most likely appreciate Dirty Dancing as well."
__label__2,"BILL BILL BILL...: La pelicula es excelente todavia no entiendo como ignoraron la nominacion al oscar por el papel que hizo BILL MURRAY en esta pelicula, es un papel muy sutil con aires de ambiguedad pero en esencia el sarcasmo y humor negro que caracteriza a Murray, acompando con un elenco de primera hace que esta pelicula sea digna de ver y comprar. altamente recomendada"

She's fortunate to be rescued by a misanthropic retired cop who lives on a tiny island in the Florida Keyes. Yes, her husband is a jerk, but why did he want to kill her?This book is by no means the strongest of Hiasen's (my favorite remainsNative Tongue) but is still entertaining and provides the satisfaction of seeing the nature-hating polluters pay for their crimes."

__label__2,"Sonic Kung Fu: Fast and fun pop-rock, a more ballad oriented set than the debut album, but still plenty of electronica influence. From Rush Hour with Love, Try Everything, Luxury Cage and Kung Fu Movies are standout tracks. Saffron is the only singer whose lyrics reference Mortal Kombat 2, Haggen-Das and early Cure all in one song and make it work perfectly. Good Stuff."
__label__1,"A serious disappointment: As a long-term employee of the Keiko Project, I looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it is an example of shoddy journalism at its worst. The author spoke to very few people who had worked on the project; the book is full of factual errors or omissions; and the presentation of the story is very one-sided. In addition, it is poorly organized and contains no index. Photo credits are not given (even though the author did not take the vast majority of the photos). In short, the book is not worth the purchase price."

__label__1,"it's okay: I love that this unit has a remote. I hate a couple things about it though. The awkward step up doesn't fit well in my car and I definitely hear static using it. I drive about an hour to work and I set it when I leave home. About 30 minutes later I have to change the station because of the static. Also the part that plugs into the ipod is loose and I have to wiggle it for the sound to work. Overall it does what I want it to do, but isn't ideal."

__label__2,"A must for any Hercules fan (or Ricky Martin!) ;-): I've always been a fan of Disney's Hercules, so the Gold Collection video is a treat! At the end there is a ""making-of"" documentary that shows everything about the movie's production process--including interviews with the voice actors and directors. I only wish it were longer! But still, it's a pretty good overview. What the video DOESN'T advertise on the jacket is a special Ricky Martin music video shown after the documentary (which I don't understand why--it seems he would be a big selling point for the video). Ricky sings the Spanish version of ""Go the Distance"" entitled ""No Importa La Distancia."" In case you didn't know, Ricky was the voice of Hercules for the Spanish language version. So if you're a Hercules fan, or a Ricky Martin fan, grab this video!"
__label__1,"wrong item: They sent the wrong item, wrong color and wrong size. and was told that they couldn't send a replaced by Christmas, unless I pay for overnight. I thought since it was their mistake I shouldnot have to pay anything. Item was returned . Will not recommend this company."
__label__1,"Awful.: I think I laughed once in the entire movie - when Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side"" came on the radio as Bernie Mac switched stations while riding with Ashton Kutcher. Then, of course, they had to ruin the joke by having ""Ebony and Ivory"" come on the radio moments later, turning a mildly humorous moment into a lame and obvious one. The actors do their best, but the script is terrible and the direction uninspired. I actually found it more compelling to watch my cat clean himself than follow the ""plot"" of this dud. But I smelled ""dog"" after the first 5 minutes, so I can't say I was too disappointed. Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher sure make some lousy movies. Put this one at the top of this list. Not even the 5 minute gag reel included on the DVD was funny. Now that ought to tell you something."

If it's a good praise and worship CD you want, pass up Tomlin, because you won't be disappointed with this. This is one of the best genre's best talents in a long time.Note: I loved Aaron Shust before the craze. I bought his CD six months before ""My Savior, My God"" was released on radio. So don't say I ride the waves, I came before the wave. In fact, I created the waves. Alright, that might be an exaggeration."

__label__2,Hilarious spoof on Ed Wood's bizarre life.: Great picture by Tim Burton starring actor Johnny Depp as Ed Wood himself. Martin Landau nearly steals the show as Bela Lugosi.
__label__1,"Awful. Just awful.: The directions weren't difficult, though it did take quite awhile to put this piece together. However, once together, it looks horrible. The drawers are all warped! Not a single drawer is straight~they are all crooked. One drawer is a darker stain than all the others, and the screws for the knobs are already stripped. We're keeping it even though it looks hideous, simply because it would be too much of a pain to take the whole dang thing apart, try to repack it properly, and pay to ship it back. I'm extremely disappointed. The quality is awful. I would give this 0 stars if I could."
__label__1,"Awfully pointless and pointlessly awful: ""A masterpiece,"" says Roger Ebert, so going by that and other rave promises on the DVD cover, I rented it. I'll know better next time. What a meandering mess. What a cheat.These fine reviews remind me of when John Stossel of ""20/20"" got some kindergartners to create messy freestyle finger paintings, then stood back and laughed as ""serious art critics"" glowingly analyzed the greatness of these sloppy, meaningless creations.There is a sense, while watching UNDERTOW, that the youngest actor in the film wrote the dialogue, or else the actors simply made it up as they went along, with the director cueing them to be sure and disconnect all thoughts mid-sentence. This movie flatly refused to be interesting. Therefore IT IS SURELY ART.This was not ""atmospheric,"" so if you're from anywhere outside the back woods of the Deep South, please don't be fooled that this is how it is."
__label__1,"WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY: i love this movie. i got it on vhs, when that came out, and on dvd, when that came out. the movie, itself, is fantastic! it is well done, the color is beautiful and the score is great! i would certainly recommend the movie, itself! (and the cd.) but....the original dvd is better because it includes things about the cast.in this one, it SAYS interviews with the cast, but that means a couple of the dancers and gene kelly's wife. no one even mentions michael beck, why he was cast and why the fantasy number was needed (to avoid controversy?).if you just want the movie and cd in one package, then fine...but it would be better to buy each one, than this combo."
__label__2,Great family movie!: This is one of those classics that can't be beat. Family friendly with fun songs and a good moral story. Still beats the Depp remake hands down!
__label__1,not scary enough: This had the makings of a real classic. It was a pity the way it turned out. There were times I actually laughed at this. I agree with the reviewer who wondered why bringing it all out in the open suddenly makes everything OK. It never explained why this was the case. It seemed to be edited very badly in places and made us laugh at what could have been truly scary. This didn't scare me at all. I kept waiting but it just didn't happen.

Sprayed water all over the interior of the sink cabinet. Very short warranty. Do not buy. Very poor construction and on the loud size. Waste king in any size from 1/2 hp to 1 hp is much quieter and has an excellent warranty.

Katie thinks that Mark is an excellent swimmer, good student in school, good-looking, etc. But one night mark called Katie and convinces her that he should go to her swim meet.I really liked this book. It taught me about all the dangers that we have on the internet. So if you ever meet somebody you don't know on the internet just use one of your BLOCK icons and he or she can't bug you any more. I think kids who are 12 and older should read this bookThank you for reading my review. I hoped you enjoyed it. So read this book today. I gave this book 4 stars ****."
__label__1,"Where have you gone Flickerstick?: Key problem: Overproduction. What kind of drugs did Sony/Epic get Flickerstick hooked on? Whatever pill, powder, or juice it was, I don't ever wanna try it. In the song ""Coke"" they changed the chorus from ""Lie here NAKED with my girl."" to ""Lie here TAKEN with my girl."" What? (...) A band can have a radio hit titled ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" but a reference to nudity is over the line. (...) Buy the indy release of Astronauts if you can still find it. Infintely superior, a near classic. This overproduced version, however, is nothing short of a catastrophe."
__label__1,"Religious propaganda: There isn't anything socially scientific about Reardon's 'study'. Notice he doesn't weigh any findings on the voices of the women who go on to feel no guilt, remorse or depression...and there are many! He's not interested in the variety of experiences of women who have had not only one abortion but sometimes two, he's interested in narrowly framing abortion for political ends. The only people who would find this book interesting is the choir that already has a negative view of abortions, in short its not objective in any way nor does it include the many many women who have never experienced any of the feelings after an abortion he describes."
__label__2,"great heavy soundtrack: this is one of the best heavy metal sountracks out there. this has one of the best songs ever released by pantera entitled cemetary gates(track 1). diedems from megadeath(track 4) was a great song, but the highlights where hey man, nice shot by filter(track 9) and 1-800-suicide by the gravediggaz(track 10). i was surprised to see a rap song on a primarily heavy metal soundtrack, but this one fit. if you liked the spawn soundtrack, crow soundtrack, and valentine soundtrack, then you will like this."
__label__1,"No stars. Don't bother&#65533;: This book is the typical crap that comes from those who are violently afraid of everything in life particularly anyone who dares tell the truth. Even the title is right off of a dumb ass, white trash bumper sticker and that's the ""best"" part. While filled with more propaganda than than a Bin Laden recruitment, it's all very low brow, adolescent, knee jerk attack, bereft of substance, wit and above all fact. Don't waste your time or your money and for God sakes don't fill your head with such garbage."

__label__2,"sweet comedy: This is the cutest movie I have watched in a long while. My Little Bride is a winner!Unless you know a little about Asian culture, My Little Bride might shock you. Who would allow their 15 year old daughter to get married and live with a man while she is still in high school? The movie is done very tastefully though, and so cute. I reccommend this to people of all ages."
__label__1,Junk: The strobe light alone makes it a worthless piece of crap it is annoying as heck and has no real purpose other then to waste the battery life. It is a good idea but that stupid strobe light kills it. There is no way to dislodge the strobe light and since its LED I can't burn it out like I want to. Save the money and just buy a push operated light instead of wasting your money like I did on this 'good idea from somebody whose job depended on a new product' ahhh
__label__1,"Not in a day or less: This book has a lot of good ideas, however, it did not help with training my 3 year old. It requires you to load up your child on liquid so he/she has the urge to go, which is a good idea. However, checking to see if he/she has dry pants every 5 minutes isn't feasible. Your conversation with your child the whole time is supposed to be about going on the potty - however many hours it takes to get them trained. My son got bored with the conversation and didn't pay attention. And once the child gets the whole going on the potty thing, they aren't supposed to tell you when they have to go, they are just supposed to go. The book states that you should put the potty where ever they may be - outside, inside, in their room - so it is easily accessible to them. I would rather have my son come and get me when he has to go.Needless to say, my son is still not potty trained and it's been 3 weeks since we've received this book."

__label__2,"Prayer is a dialogue.... actually a response...: Judson Cornwall does an excellent job of explaining that our conversations with our Heavenly Father should be a RESPONSE to what He has already said. As we delight ourselves in the Lord and in His Word, He will place His desires in our hearts (Psalm 37:4). If we abide in Him, and His Word abides in us, we will ask whatever we desire and it shall be done for us (John 15:7).It would be prudent to read this book at least once a year."

__label__2,"Another 12th Night!: With Alec Guinness at his finest; how can anything, he is in, fail?The story of 12th Night is so well known, it requires some pretty convincing acting, I think, to carry it off successfully. This production has the fine and convincing - even superlative acting, to achieve this unequivocal success.All the principal actors were magnificent in their roles and even Tommy Steele managed to overcome his well known name as a 'pop' singer - just about! The inclusion of Steele into the cast was inspired - or flawed - depending upon one's view of the man as a singer/performer. Sadly, his well known persona shone brightly through his performance - which would please or annoy, according to one's view of this competent singer."

This has to be one of the worst software packages I've ever used. The interface is maddeningly archaic. It makes one wonder about the caliber of programmer that Broderbund is hiring. It also makes one wonder who's writing these reviews, some hardly seems believable after actually experiencing the software.PLEASE, do yourself a favor, don't believe the positive reviews, and save your money. Given a technical background, I lulled myself into believing I should be able to handle it in spite of the negative reviews, and came away severely disappointed.Stick to a general 2D drawing program such as AutoCad, Vellum, or Visio, it'll be much less headache and still fulfill 99% of what most users are looking for."

__label__2,"Comfortable but big: First: Huge thanks to all the reviewers who let us know to order a smaller size than we usually wear. I am a size 8 but, based on the other reviews, I bought these in the 6.5-7.5 size and they still feel slightly big. The size 8-9 would no doubt have been un-wearable.For years I've worn the ballet-style slippers, very lightweight, machine wash and dry. Lately my aching feet have been demanding some cushion and the Acorns are obviously highly recommended for that. They're not lying. These things are definitely like little pillows under my feet and I love that.It's just unfortunate that the sizing is so off. Even with the smaller size, they slip a little on my heel when I walk which is mildly annoying. With true sizing, I would have given these five stars, but I'm still granting four stars for being the most comfortable things I have ever had on my feet."
__label__2,"Celestron Educational Microscope 4030: Great microscope. We were looking for something with substance, not like a toy, but without the high price. This is it. Easy to set up. The lenses are nice quality and easy to focus. The fine adjustment focus works beautifully. The reflector lense is perfect for using the microscope anywhere, not just near an outlet for a light source. All in all Great quality for a fair price"

__label__2,"Poetry on every page.: As in her first novel, Falling Through Darkness, MacCullough has crafted a beautiful novel with prose that sings. Her characters are vivid, the dialogue pitch perfect, the situation very real, and the resolution hopeful but realistic. All in all this is a terrific read from a very talented writer. I look forward to her other books."

__label__2,"Good textbook for introducing the period.: An interesting overview of a pivotal period in American History. The rise of America from a new nation to an imperial power.

__label__1,"Great Look, Poor Quality: Bought these speakers quite a while ago. The reviews seemed to speak very highly of this product but to say the least what I received was a very poor quality, weak base, and rear speakers that made little to no difference. Only if your ear is right next to the rear speakers can you hear them.The speakers have a great look, can be mounted on the wall and have adequate cables for placement but I do not buy speakers for looks alone or I would just print out the picture and tape it to my wall to look at.The wired remote is fine but the cable is a bit short. Being that the sub is underpowered this is not really a problem unless you have to place the sub further away because you don't have the room.Needless to say I have gone back to my previous Altec Lansing speakers I bought about 6 years ago.Closing Summary: If you like speakers that look great but offer nothing in terms of sound quality then these speakers are for you."
__label__2,"A Very Sweet Cozy: I was very happy to see that this series is available on Kindle. I have previously read several of them and have enjoyed the character of Miss Silver and her knitting. She will figure things out and solve the mystery, but seems to me to be more likeable than Miss Marple. These are definately set in their time and slow moving, but charming and an enjoyable read."

__label__2,"The Great Divider: This book is a Bastian of balance. The other side of the coin from what Moore has presented. Compare this to F911 and its obvious that Moore took the ""Hollywood"" approach to his move. Moore used simple psychological manipulation to lead you down the path to false conclusions. Exposed is his method of thinking; Assumptions, innuendos, conspiracy theories and items taken WAY out of context is, according to him, fact.Buy this book and see how this man has single handedly through his deliberate ""manipulation"" of fact, driven a huge wedge into America. It amazes me that people worship him as some righteous person, all the while he is more concerned about counting his millions then caring about the country that affords him the luxury to pursue his craft."
__label__2,"Donald Davis--Storyteller Extrordinaire!: I am buying Donald Davis' cassette, ""THE CRACK OF DAWN"" for the second time. I owned my first copy for many years until by stereo was stolen from my car and had Mr. Davis' tape in it. I had the privilege of meeting him at a storytelling festival at Cal State University, Los Angeles and heard this story in person. It is every bit as good on tape. Mr. Davis spins his yarn in such a mesmerizing way that you can almost see his Aunt Laura and hear the ""Crack of Dawn."""
__label__2,"GBA: I must say I was somewhat disappointed in the GBA. The graphics are outstanding, but there is still no backlight, which makes it difficult to see. I have a qorm light, but it's annoying and only lights the ceter of the screen. By not backlighting, Nintendo is increasing battery life, but I don't think that is nearly as important as game play.My other complaint is game selection. So far I have only played two games worth buying, although I own four. One is Tony Hawk Two, and the other is Mario Kart: Super Circuit. Both are outstanding games one can play for hours, and are the reasons of my four star rating. Other than these, however, there are very little.Overall, I would recommend this if you travel a lot or want something to play when not at home, but otherwise just buy a console. I recommend Xbox, but gamecube would be better for younger gamers, as are all nintendo products."
__label__1,"A woman's point of view is not enough: Just because the Old Testament is rarely approached from a woman's point of view does not, in itself, provide enough reason to recommend this book. It came highly recommended, and understandably so, given Diamant's ability to turn a phrase. The repeated descents into bestiality, vulgarity and abuse took the place of a plot, and ruined what might have otherwise been a remarkable book."
__label__1,"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon sucks!: I bought this game the day it came out hoping for a fun shoot'em up experience. When you play on xblox live even with 16 people EVERY SINGLE GAME turns into a boring, pointless, frustrating snipe fest. Just about every player ALWAYS picks a sniper rifle and when the round stars every player finds some dark hole or bush to hide behind and the sniping begins. Ghost Recon multiplayer = Boring, cheap, scope camping people who all think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread because they can sit somewhere and shoot you from a mile away while your the only one in the whole game with an assault rifle. SAVE YOUR MONEY for Counter-Strike, or Soldier of Fortune for Xbox if like REAL fun multiplayer experiences. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME ITS SUCKS TERRIBLY!"
__label__1,watch out: We bought the PH4-13R-01 about a year ago. We used it for about 4 months in the summer and had a few instances where it blew the circuit breaker but no other problems. We didn't use it in the winter. This summer it didn't work. It wouldn't turn on. I looked in one of the vents and saw a lot of broker pieces. The problem was the plastic turbine blower had shattered.Now I am trying to find a replacement part but I don't believe they sell them. Also I found an article about a recall for their space heater sold on QVC because the poor quality of the parts used created a fire hazard. I believe my broken blower is one of their poor quality parts
__label__2,"Still a favorite: I had this book in a previous printing and lost it in a move. Now that I have it back in its new printing, it's like being united with an old friend. It is the most clear and comprehensive book on Fair Isle knitting that I know of. Also, Starmore presents the material with tons of beautiful photos and lots of tips and unique and helpful ways to describe what's supposed to be happening with the yarns. Starmore is so smart and talented but her writing is not snooty or condescending (like the Principles of Knitting author). I'm going to attempt my first steek with my next project!"
__label__1,"Nothingness: I wasted $8.00.Rambling writing going nowhere. Expect to see this book as a prop in bookcases at discount furniture stores and in new model homes.If you happen to see the movie it's obvious the screenwriter(s) didn't think much of it either. The plot is similar to the book in only the broadest sense.The author probably doesn't care how his novel was adapted, for the popularity of the movie has likely attracted more suckers like me to buy the book."
__label__1,"Works only if you are Shaun T!: I bought this for myself and several of my friends. The program was difficult from the word GO. and though it looked exciting at first... i soon realized how much strain it was putting on my knees, ankles and even my thighs. I exercise regularly and do not have any muscle ache issues but this one left me NOT SORE but actually injured and I just had to stop. anyways my friends stopped this too after a few days because of one reason or another. IN short, buy some other program probably p90X but not this one. you can get seriously injured."
__label__2,"Hop! Plop!: What a fun book! Kids will learn about problem solving and working together (without even knowing it). The onomatopoeias (if that's how you spell and pluralize it) and the pictures make the book amusing and enjoyable. After reading it, my 4 years old and 2 year old (and I) were sliding down our own elephant trunks.I highly recommend it."
__label__1,"LOVE RICKY, BUT...: I love Ricky Smiley's prank calls, but this CD left alot to be desired.

In fact to say the move starts Nick Cave is ridiculous, he comes off in his brief bits as full of himself and a poseur.Brilliantly made film, buy it."

There are definate similarities between John Mayer and Dave Matthews, but I personally think John Mayer's songs are catchier and he has more potential for growth at this point than DMB does.

__label__2,music lover from Rochester: I was pleasantly surprised at how good this CD is. It has a great R&B flavor to it & Justin sounds great on each song. There's a song written by Brian McKnight & one written by Justin Timberlake & Justin G. really makes them his own. Don't overlook this as just another CD that will appeal to teens or people who are into bubblegum pop. This will really appeal to anyone who enjoys good R&B flavored pop.
__label__2,"swept away!: Here it is, the ultimate Survivor episode, a thinking person's adventure tale. The writing hooked me with the very first sentence, ""The wound was their path"", and what a path it becomes, full of twists and surprises and Nathan Lee's heart full of hope. I've never seen a book like this, with such wild premises that seem to have no connection, but which by the end are woven into a single thread. On the one hand Year Zero is a novel about the virus from hell, the big extinction event that we humans think can't happen to us. Then there's the cloning of human lab rats that has echoes of Frankenstein and Brave New World. Nathan Lee's escape through the Himalayas is almost a story in itself, but Long keeps on spinning his web, and somehow, amazingly ties it all together in the end. I started describing the story to a friend, then just stopped and gave her the book to read for herself. This one defies simple description. All I can say is, dive in and get swept away."
__label__2,"great book!: I am a teacher and I bought this audio book to use with my 5th grade class. Each student has a copy of the book and we are reading it together.

__label__2,"Sometimes you like this book, sometimes you don't: I laughed, I drooled, I ran to the pantry for a Reese's Peanut Butter Minature, I thought about Mallo Cups for the first time in ages, I remembered the Halloweens of the '70s, I wished I could have eaten a Caravelle when they still made them. I loved this book, but it got bogged down on his road trip to the local candy companies - I'd never heard of Abba Zabbas, or the Idaho Spud and that made me lose interest at that point."

__label__1,"Possibly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.: Wow. After hearing all the praise this movie has gotten and it's great cast, I figured this would definitely be a good watch. After just a half hour of the movie, I became so bored I really wanted to turn it off. I didn't however, and kept the movie running. During the next 2 1/2 hours I was baffled at what people saw in this snooze-fest. It's a horrible movie. Beyond horrible! This couldn't keep you interested no matter what happened. It just drags and drags and drags. A couple war scenes are slightly entertaining, but besides that it totally sucks. In closing, do not judge a book by it's cover. Just because De Niro is in this do not think it will be good. This is probably the most overrated and boring movie I've ever seen. Steer clear of this unless you like wasting your time."
__label__2,"I'll keep it short!: The sound quality is great. Block out nearly 100% background noise. Only thing preventing a rating of 5/5 stars is the lack of bass (what do you expect from such a tiny earbud) and superior comfort. Until bluetooth is perfected, these will definitely be the last pair of ""wired"" earbuds I purchase."

Went to the store to buy it, looked cute in the box. When I got home, what a piece of junk! Cardboard pictures that hang on the wall, and cardboard rugs! The oven door won't stay closed, JoJo actually blocks the spinning of the mirror, and the swing keeps falling off. Wouldn't survive a day of play with anyone, let alone a 2 1/2 year old. Would have returned it, but my daughter loves JoJo."
__label__1,"Sinks to the Bottom: I have read so many great books about the sea, survival on the ocean and island life---Adrift:76 Days Lost at Sea, Dove, Castaway, Saved!, Fatu Hiva. The list is long. This will never be on it. Truly one of the most boring and confusing books I have read on any subject, it jumps from ad nauseus descriptions of fish, fishing gear, waves and storms to slim references to the actual story. It is impossible to figure out who the characters are. The author throws them in without warning or description.I suspect that the author took a three-chapter article and fleshed it out with every detail he could come up with to stretch it into a book."
__label__2,"The Nativity Story -- Great for your family: The Nativity Story is a little simplistic and moves on quickly and without much of turmoil that had to be present around these events but with all of the violent and stupid films that are released now days, I am thankful that a studio made this telling of the story. The Nativity Story is a great faith-based family story. Perfect for watching with your children as you try to get them to understand Mary and Joseph as living, breathing, people. The film is well intentioned and well done. In some ways it is like a ""Golden Book"" made into a film. I recommend it highly to those who are trying to bring an understanding of faith and Christianity to their children in a way that is easy to absorb."
__label__2,"Competitive Bidding in the 21st Century: Fantastic Book!! Marshall Miles is at his best when he tackles the most difficult area of Contract Bridge - Competitive Bidding. His book is the latest in a line of excellent resource materials for the advancing player and covers all aspects of competitive bidding. Miles introduces a complete competitive bidding system, which taken as a whole, will answer many of the questions a partnership might encounter during a session. It is well laid out and covers each aspect of competitive bidding in a detailed manner. He starts with some interesting comments on overcalling with 4 card suits, details how both the overcalling and opening sides could deal with various situations including when ""Not"" to negative double and ends with a chapter on various ""Gadgets"" available to the serious competitive bidding partnership."
__label__1,"Much less than I expected: I was very disappointed with this one. In the introduction, the author reminds us that any games or activities must be relevant to the subject. Unfortunately, I saw very few activities that I could use as-is in my workshops. They would take too much time of a two-hour workshop for little return, or seemed to have little point at all. I saw a few I could adapt to the content of my parent and/or teacher early childhood workshops."
__label__1,"shoddy e-book formatting - Penguin should be ashamed: The formatting of the Kindle edition of this book is a disgrace. All the poems are left-aligned, regardless of the stanza forms. Penguin should be ashamed to charge nearly full price for such shoddy work. And it was impossible to have any warning of this, because the prreview available consisted only of the introduction to the book by Robert Mezey (an excellent introduction, by the way). Two free e-book editiions of Hardy's earlier poetry have far better formatting, even if they aren't perfect."
__label__1,Obviously not worth it...: Considering I found this dvd in Walmart for $10 I thought I was literally in for a treat.Not likely.First off my main problem with the girls is that they lip synched too much throughout the whole show.They could've at least redid the backing vocals instead of them obviously sounding like Beyoncé.I saw the same exact show live and it had way more energy than this excuse of a performance.It must've been taped during the end of the tour because all 3 girls looked tired.If you literally want your money's worth I suggest you pick up Beyoncé's Live in Wembley show because her performance of Dangerously in Love was weak compared to a more matured version on her dvd.Don't even get me started on Michelle's song Heard A Word.Babygirl was straining to hit the high notes towards the end and I'm surprised it wasn't edited out because she sounded bad!.I love the girls to the heart but this was a bad idea.

__label__1,"Elevator Music: This album will put Sominex and night-time Nyquil out of business. It's elevator music-meets dental office. A big disappointment. I'm a fan of Floyd (both with and without R.Waters), have been looking forward to this album for some time, and it seems the anticipation was greater than the event. I'm just glad I didn't pay top dollar to see Gilmour in concert if this is what he's going to play. My recommendation is Gilmour fans buy his awesome DVD album from a few years back. It's a live show featuring old floyd songs, some random new stuff, and some tunes I never heard of, but all of which are very enjoyable. On An Island...well, it should have been left there."
__label__1,"Julie and Romeo Get Lucky: I have enjoyed Jeanne Ray's other novels; light and entertaining family fare.

Without this book I would have been a wreck with ulcers because of all of the tasks I had to keep track of.If you're looking to help yourself get a handle on your work and life, read the book. I recommend reading it all the way through once, then going back and working through it. It sure helped me."

It's been five weeks ( it's now September) and we've been told to wait until mid October before we can lodge a 'missing item'. Very sad. Even sadder that ecom now has The Book Depository....I expect service standards will start to fall...
__label__1,"Trash, do not purchase: I bought the 512MB version of this product, plugged it into my computer to charge (it charges from the USB port), it flickered a few times then died completely. I contacted their customer service and have had absolutely no response or action. Apparently all they are interested in is taking your money and sending you a rather expensive plastic paperweight, as it can be used for almost nothing else. Build quality is also very poor (it is made in China). Shame on Oregon Scientific for selling such a piece trash and then not even answering any of the customer queries for return or replacement."
__label__1,"Simply did not work: Simply did not deliver as promised. I went to the conference, and I found the theology to be unbiblical, useless and with no results. As usual, author blamed everything on lack of my faith etc...Advise: Seek God personally, there are no quick fixes. Anyone who promises you that is offering snake oil. Wallen was right about one thing, Jesus is the final authority and a relationship with the Holy Spirit is of vital importance. The rest is just his views and takes on the origins of soul and demons; which I found to be flawed, contradicting and non biblical.Before I went to the conference I had a good review posted up here, but after having seen for myself, I cannot agree with it anymore."

__label__2,Great product but not taken care of: I've used No-Ad since I was a little girl. It's the only sunblock/sunscreen that I can use without breaking out in a rash. Sadly the stores in my area don't carry it anymore so I had to buy it online. The reason I chose to buy this one was because there was not an outrageous shipping fee. The others charged like 5-6 bucks to ship this 16 oz bottle. The product itself is fine but the bottle does not look taken care of. It's dinged and the labels are pealing off so that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. So over all product is excellent but I wish the seller would make sure his products are being taken better care of.

I really enjoy ""Love's in our hearts on Christmas"" and ""Kiss me at Midnight""... but I love the a cappella version of ""O Holy Night"".

__label__1,"This could have been so much better: Eagerly awaited as the first book to focus on the UK's Northern Soul scene, this is a real disappointment. The book hardly features the music at all preferring to concentrate on the author's addiction to amphetamines. For an insider to the scene, the book is worthless. For an outsider it gives a totally false impression. Not everyone went to Wigan Casino for the drugs, some of us actually liked (and still do) Soul music.And yes, you will find I contributed to the book, about three pages all told starting at page 101, but that was before I had read the rest of the book !"
__label__1,Disappointed: I have been using essential oils in my products for several years now. I was looking to add a nice directory to my bookshelf at my skin care studio for co-workers or clients to look at. I have several books on essential oils and Suzanne Catty's Hydrosol book(which is amazing)I have other resource information from well respected aromatherapists as well. Many of intended uses for skin care in this book differ from all my other sources. Her description of the smells differ from my experience as well as all my books also. There also wasn't enough information on the use of oils on the skin though probably just as well since it doesn't seem like I will ever use this book for anything but knowing the Latin names for each. I may even just send it back.
__label__1,"Yet more whining about the McCarthy era: I'm so tired of Hollywood whining about the McCarthy era. Most recently it was ""The Contender""; before that, ""The Crucible,"" and before *that,* ""Guilty By Suspicion."" They're like a dog with an old slipper it can't stop chewing. As a somewhat mainstream sometimes-consumer of Hollywood's products, I have a message for Hollywood producers: No one cares about a bunch communists and their fellow travelers who lost their jobs in the 50s!The thirst for victim status manifests itself in far, far too many areas of American society as it is. Hollywood producers, why don't you try to slake that thirst by telling each other at cocktail and coke parties that *you* would have stood in the breach and never given in to political pressure, if only you'd been lucky enough to have been accused. Don't take your desire for victim status out on the rest of us. To paraphrase a famous McCarthy era Hollywood luminary: ""Have you no shame? The McCarthy era is dead!"""
__label__1,"Nothing revolutionary.: This book is great if you are new to content writing or need a quick go to on your desk. Honestly though I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. This book doesn't have anything that isn't already available for free by a simple google search. If you want a physical printed book to keep at your desk, I would say get this. But if you are like most people, a google search is just as easy and it is free."
__label__2,Very Good Product: Very pleased with this watering wand. It was more expensive than others but you get what you pay for and this one did everything that it said it would.
__label__1,"Offensive to Christians: I was so delighted to begin my first novel by Nora Roberts. thinking what a gifted writer she was turning out to be. I was looking forward to getting other novels she wrote when I completed ""Private Scandals"". I quickly became dismayed when, as most authors do today, she began using the Lord's name as a curse word. Over and over. Why do authors only choose to disrespect Christians, and no other group? Every few pages, she wrote, ""Jesus!"", ""Christ!"", ""Jesus Christ"". By the time I got to page 166, I had blotted out 19 blasphemies, and there are 405 pages. Page 166 also finally caused me to put it down when she wrote, ""Jesus H. Christ!"". It was the final blow; the last straw. You never read, ""Buddha!"", ""Confucious!"", or ""Mohammed!"", do you? Why, that would be offensive to readers!!! Christians should begin complaining about this rampant disrespect for our religion."

__label__2,"Outstanding book: Someone once said ""there are three kinds of liars: liars, damn liars, and statisticians.""I read this book in high school, and it shaped my judgement of the news media, business, and advertising ever since. Never trust the numbers without knowing their basis, and remember: a statistician is the type of guy who would put his head in an oven, and his feet in a bucket of ice, and say that, on average, he felt fine."

__label__2,"WHAT?: These are great songs but I agree with earlier reviewers. This is not a greatest hits album. Why so few tracks over 2 cds? Roll With It, Whatever, Stand By Me, All Around the World, Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, It's Good to Be Free and Round Are Way are all BIG omissions. Especially Little By Little."

However, the track that glistens the most is ""Clocks,"" which is a beautiful urban ballad, bound to be a hit. This is a summer record made for the autumn."

__label__1,"Horribly Disappointed: I bought this specifically because I had the M240 and I had been so pleased with that.This MP3 player has never worked correctly. It freezes up on daily basis, often takes 5-10 tries (and 15-20 minutes) to actually get it to turn on AND play music and is generally a huge hassle. I've updated the firmware, bought a new battery, contacted Sansa multiple times (and got NO response) and the thing still doesn't work correctly.The sound is good once it ever turns on and plays, but that's about all I have to say for it. I understand that other people are happy with it and suspect mine is a lemon, but the lack of response from Sansa has made me cautious about trying another one of their products, to say the least."

__label__1,"Parts fall apart in a short time: I bought 2 of these. The handles started coming apart as soon as I started using them. They were just press fitted together, so I pulled them apart and applied some glue and that problem was solved. I thought about writing a bad review then, but figured the problem was easily solved, so I didn't. However, this summer the pump assemblies on both have fallen apart. This is a very poorly made product. I have had no luck with gilmour products. I've seen early failure in their hoses, hose sprayers, watering timers, lawn sprinklers, and now tank sprayers. They are the brand that is available at most hardware and home improvement stores, so everybody ends up with some of their products. I can't vouch for any other brand, but am going to start searching for one that doesn't so consistently disappoint."

The mouse goes through a lot of hardships and returns to Fort Marshank where Badrang lived at the end of the book and I can't tell you the rest.

You get no personal thoughts really of the people in the story and don't care what happens to them.

__label__2,"from William B. Eerdmans: The Bible is at the heart of Christian life and witness. Yet the application of the Bible to the practice of Christian faith - to spiritual growth, pastoral discussion, and even preaching - is often too nave and simplistic.Filling a real gap between biblical studies and practical theology, The Bible in Pastoral Practice recovers a critical awareness of the ways in which the Bible is - and might better be - employed in pastoral practice. Experts from various traditions and backgrounds address a fascinating array of topics arranged in three broad areas: (1) how pastors in the past have used the Bible, (2) how contemporary biblical scholarship relates to pastoral practice, and (3) how the Bible applies to Christian living, including such areas as ethics, spirituality, pastoral care, preaching, the arts, and more.An invaluable resource, The Bible in Pastoral Practice will equip scholars, students, and those in all areas of pastoral work to creatively appropriate the Bible."
__label__1,"BIG!!!!: This carseat looked so comfortable and when we put our son into it, he seemed to like it and it fit him so well! But when we got it home and tried to install it!!!!!!! This thing is ***HUGE*** We have a Chevy Blazer and an '05 Dodge Ram Quad Cab and this car seat will not fit in either of the trucks! I had to move the passenger seats all the way forward and sitting up straight in order to fit the car seat in. It would not fit in the center because then I would have to move both the driver's seat and the passenger seats up! If you had a mini-van or something that had a large back seat, you probably won't have any problems.It was also a pain to install! I tried to install it in the Blazer, but I couldn't get the seat belt tight(no LATCH) because where I would put my knees in the seat it where the belt has to run under the padding. You may have better luck with the LATCH.I am now looking for a seat that my 20lbs, 27inch tall, 4 month old will be able to use! Good Luck!"

Like most manufacturers these days it seems more and more things are being made in China. These bakers are no exception. Is it really THAT much cheaper that something this small can't be made in America? Even the lids on the Copper Core are now made in China.Aside from the complaining the pans work well and are attracive."
__label__1,"Huge ""Ick Factor"" Quotient: At first, reading this novel was fun, like watching adventure serials. There were sword fights, wild escapes, corny villains -- it was fun.Then, an evil, homicidal nun tried to rape the heroine. Hmmm. For some reason, the book lost me when that happened. Other violent acts added to the ""Ick Factor"" quotient.Also, the hero and heroine don't meet until about two-thirds of the way through the story. And Salvador, who has been true hero material throughout the book, suddenly becomes a jealous, distrustful misogynist. Was it something in the water?"

The music is something different to the indie/emo sound than what people have heard in the past.I really enjoyed listening to At The Drive-In, and was shocked when they split up. Their sound was unique and was not compared to anything except now through THE MARS VOLTA. With a new band there is a new sound. The Lyrics stick in your head with Cedric, and if they don't then the music will. It is something new that other bands will have a hard time trying to sound like. But that is why THE MARS VOLTA is so good, the have their own sound which is in itself art. BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WON""T REGRET IT!"

The book also has lots of filler material from previous editions. It outdated and just plain idiotic to be in a book that costs this much.Lemay just doesn't understand the publishing reality of todays Web.

It shows a lot about the catholic church and it also make me understand why my relatives were thought of so badly when they came to America. The Irish in the book were poor and relied on the government and the men leave their children and the mothers don't know what to do. I saw my own family in this story, especially my Grandfather. I saw the real Ireland not the land that is told about in fairy tales. Ireland has come a long way and is so much better for it. This is not putting down the Irish this is showing how the survived.

If you want a Study Bible with notes and references then get a different one. I love it. Just do your research and get the Bible that fits your needs.

In the book, he talks about in a general way you attack and defend as a team. A lot of soccer books focus on drills and diagrams, but this one describes general strategies: attack strategies like staying wide, diagonal runs, blind side runs, and overlapping; and defense strategies like staying compact, pressuring, supporting the pressure, and delay. You get to hear it from the guy who knows.But what I really like about the book are the intense black and white photos of Indiana games. They're great!"

__label__1,"congratulations on finding an easy solution: I am amazed that any free-thinking person would be so ignorant to believe the simple paradigm: Liberals=bad, conservatives=good. It is this thinking, not every liberal in America, that is destroying this country and has done nothing to serve it.

I love that the seat can be put on a regular toilet. The one thing that I don't like is the fact that it seems to be a bit cheap in the way it is put together. the blue seat part comes apart from the white frame that it is in fairly easily. Hasn't been an issue yet at all but I just don't like it. I do like the fact that it can be a stool as well. All around, I like this potty a lot. Just seems to be cheaply put together."

__label__2,"Different and not quite typical: Nora Roberts has fallen into the category of Danielle Steele and LaVyrle Spencer recently, basing all her books on a formula that, while enjoyable, it utterly predictable.However, in the ""Key"" trilogy, Roberts does venture into previously unexplored territory. Keeping with her supernatural flair but venturing away from wicca, she introduces Celtic mythology as a key element here.As always, the characters are well-developed and the relationships mature as one would expect them too. An enjoyable, easy read."

__label__1,"An attack on masculinity disguised as an attack on logic: Although it may not be immediately evident, the real theme of this book is to discredit rational and logical thought processes by linking them with Hitler via Weininger and Wittgenstein. The idea is that masculinity is essentially evil and leads to all sorts of horrors such as rational and logical thinking, which somehow lead to the Holocaust. This discourse is part of a much larger one in which science is the ultimate bugaboo. This sort of thing goes at least as far back as the Romantics (""ye murder to dissect""), but in this case is mixed in with the idea that gay men and women are on the side of illogic and unreason, and are therefore the good guys in the war against linear thinking of any sort, which is seen as a product of male heterosexuality. In short, this book is nonsense."
__label__2,"Works fine, a bit flimsy: The cables feel thin so it seems a little flimsy but it works just fine. I've had it for a while now and it survived an apartment move so it can't be that fragile."
__label__2,"Simply Wonderful: I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it on some movie channel or other in 1991 when I was twelve. I don't remember any of the other details but the movie stuck with me. It wasn't until it came out on DVD that I saw it again and for once my childhood memories remained intact. This movie holds up in so many ways: the setting and how the cinematography caught it, the subtle humor, the acting. Everything. Do yourselves a favor and order it now."

__label__1,Wouldn't reccommend: I purchased this hatchet at my local Lowe's two weeks ago. I used it primarily to make kindling from larger seasond firewood. It worked very well until last night when the handle shattered just below the head. I sent an e-mail to Fiskars and am now waiting for their response.
__label__1,"whimsical at best: I just have to say that I am suffering, trying to get through this book. It is required reading for a college class, and I actually came online to see if I could find it as a book on tape so that I could just play it in the background while doing something else. There are little bits of useful information here and there, but honestly, the woman sounds like she is writing for a small child. Perhaps this would have been more useful for students in the 6th-7th grade."
__label__1,"DON'T BUY THIS: I was very interested in this item given the price and everything it includes. But, what everyone says is right. The actual width of the wire is 8 gauge; but the wire itself is 12 gauge. You're paying for insulation. Also, the hardware is cheap and not durable at all. Save your money and get something else."
__label__1,Hearth & Garden Standard Round Table Cover: Totally unacceptable product. The elastic band used to keep the cover in place became non-elastic in less than 2 months. Now the cover can be blown off by light breezes making it totally useless for the purpose intended. A waste of money.
__label__1,Does not fit on peg board: Has clips in the back but does not fit on peg board. They are stackable but that to is a little tricky to accomplish. Would not recommend these if you want them soley to hang on a peg board application.

__label__1,"Excellent Clip-on fan, Except that it falls down out of its clip: A sturdy little fan, with a grippy clamp. Very adjustable. Lacks data regarding how much power it draws. Grounded plug. Not too loud, especially on lower setting. Added 1 January 2010: But, having used it now for three months, I am a bit disappointed by the flimsy clip, as noted by other reviewers. Hard to say if it is a design or manufacturing defect, but defective it is. When you try to adjust the fan or to move it, down it goes. Much to the fan's credit, its multiple bounces on the floor have not destroyed it.So, my modified review is: a great fan if it is going to stay put. If you plan to move it around, find one with a better connection to its base."
__label__1,"Ironic: Coulter seems to think it's impossible to speak to liberals, when it's equally as hard to talk to onservatives. Unless you have some lingering hatred for liberals, or have not been able to express yourself to them, this book is for you."
__label__1,"Going down...: OK, ""Magician"" (the first book of this series) had something: it was original and fast paced, and had interesting characters. There was more action per page than in most fantasy books, and the plot twists were admirable.""Silverthorn"", tough, is flat and predictable. If I could go back in time I would consider ""Magician"" a standalone work, and skip reading the rest of the Riftwar saga."

__label__1,"So disappointing: We purchased this monitor thinking it would be a great way to help our 2 year old transition into his big boy room, but were quickly aware this might have not been the best choice. There is a constant clicking sound that comes through the monitor receiver, the lights are not indicitive of the baby's cries, it turns on at random times and last night static surges woke our 2 year old up at 5 a.m. What a disappointment since our son likes the light show so much...but there is just too many negatives to keep using this monitor."

__label__1,"Eh...: I picked up this book, after reading Cujo, Christine, and 4 past midnight. However, this wasnt at all what i was expectingAlot of people have already said that it's more of a coming of age story. Well, the story was okay, but the writing wasn't very good, unlke his other books. This one kept going back and forth, between reports, people, and narratives. As well as confusing, it was boring.I personally dont like non-fiction writing, but alot of this was written as if it was.I would recomend it to anyone who enjoys the nonfiction style but also enjoys the supernatural."
__label__2,"WORD OF MOUTH IS BEST: I purchased this book because I heard reviews from soldiers who served in Iraq & Afghanistan. All said this book represents the truth & not limited/censored press reports. I bought it because I wanted know the truth about various living conditions & the US progress in addressing the Taliban & Al Queda issue. My rating is based on hear say because I have not read the book yet, but I trust in the words of those who recommended it."
__label__1,"What a hassle!: The large bowl came broken. From the way it broken it's obvious that it's not the shipping process, but rather a condition occurred in the manufacture/original packing stage. It's hard to imagine a company can produce quality product if it doesn't care much on the product in the manufacturing process. very disappointed."

__label__1,"Unreliable, in my opinion: I've had a few problems with this one:1. There are 3 larger cut-outs in the screen, so if the screen rotates wrongly (as it will, when the bolt loosens), coffee gets through the screen. I guess a courser ground than supermarket coffee that is pre-ground would work better. I had to keep fishing out grounds from my cup.2. The bolt in the plunger loosens.3. My bottom disk on the plunger broke apart after 9 months of repeated (almost daily) use."

__label__1,"TWO SONGS DO NOT A GOOD ALBUM MAKE: ""Walking Down Your Street"" and ""If She Knew What She Wants"" are both high caliber songs. They sound good, the lyrics make sense and they are just all around good songs.The rest of the album did not appeal to me. I didn't like any of the other songs and I especially detested ""Walk Like an Egyptian."" Like real Egyptians walked around with their limbs at right angles following obsessive/compulsive step formations! Oh, puh-lease! That song has never once failed to irk me. I hate it.The Bangles were talented, but I just was not one of their fans or followers."
__label__1,"Waste of Paper: Although I scored in the top 15% of those taking the SS content exam and received an excellence award from ETS for my performance I can't attribute much or any of that success to this book.Aside from grammatical errors and errors on the sample tests that an editor should have caught, the content covered in the book was nothing close to the test material.The author's feminist agenda showed through and was annoying and unnessary. Major supreme court rulings listed on the test weren't mentioned in the book nor did the world history section in anyway help prepare me for the exam.I purchased an e-book that was also terrible except that it served as an excellent outline for online reading on the topics covered.This book should be avoided. I'm suprised CliffNotes published it."
__label__2,"Good Value: I have the blue, red, and black Zefal water cages. I like these because the plastic part is the part that connects to the frame, whic helps against paint chipping. The all-metal ones will eventually chip the paint. I've had mine for 2-years plus and haven't experienced any problems. Yes, they don't come with screws; that's how they keep the price down. The bolts are 5mm. I bought some stainless steel ones from my local hardware store."
__label__2,"I'm an excellent driver: Classic - if you haven't seen this movie, you need to drive to the video store tonight and rent it. Absolutely wonderful acting, great storyline, fantastic plot. Dustin Hoffman at his best. Tom Cruise is only mildly annoying as well. Great flick!!"
__label__2,"Great Racer: The BEST portable racer ever. This game is better than Ridge Racer V on the PS2. The only racing games I like better are the Gran Tourismo series games. Don't bother wasting time with Top Gear, go straight to GT Advance. The difficulty level of the game is so finely tuned that you will always make some progress. Each tune up you earn will help you unlock tracks and cars, keeping the play challenging for a long time. Great response to the controls makes this racer FUN!"
__label__2,"Jon Water's Protege is alive and living in Brooklyn.: What a rollicking good time this movie is! Forget ""Priscilla, move over ""Trick"" and take it down to the lower level ""Broken Hearts Club,"" these movies have NOTHING on the outlandish hijinks of Scarnici & his gang of loveable misfit friends. The fact that Scarnici wrote, directed and starred in this picture proves his talent beyond a shadow of a doubt. My favorite scene in the movie is when Scarnici and his friends are at the Townhouse(buy the flck and you'll know what I am talking about). Suddenly the actors start dancing in such a true, uninhibited fashion that to feel joy as an Acting Teacher was all I could come up with. I hear Scarnici has a new film entitled ""Perfection"" which is in Pre-Production and I can only delight in the anticipation of what he has up his crafty,insanely hilarious sleeve. Kudos to you Scarnici! You are an inspiration to us all."
__label__1,"Too academic and complex: This book is too academic in the sense that it is a collection of theory with little practical examples and that goes too far into complex technical detail. It seems like the man pages have just been copied and formatted, with a little extra explanation (but not much.)"
__label__2,"It catches you!: One of the things I liked most about the new show is that she doesn't play the cutesy little girl role. She is real. She doesn't rely on anything but her talent, and experience. I recommend this series.I am anxious for the parts 4, 5, and 6 to come out."
__label__2,"Helped relieve lower back pain: At about week 22 of my pregnancy with twins, I started getting severe lower back pains. My doctor recommended a pregnancy belt. After receiving it and wearing it a full day, my back pain was significantly reduced. Sometimes, even when wearing it, I still get pains, but more often than not, the belt really, really helps.It's pretty comfortable, but can be a little awkward to wear when going to the bathroom. When I'm at work, I wear it under clothes, and at home, I wear it over my clothes.Before the pregnancy, I was a size 14. As I'm carrying twins, I ordered a large, and it fits great. I'm in my 8th month, and there's at least 5"" of expansion room."
__label__2,"Small but still fun and challenging: The box is only 6""x6""x 2-3/4"" so it was smaller than expected. It's also no Melissa & Doug puzzle, so the pieces feel thin by comparison and not as robust. The puzzle itself is well executed--images span the pieces in clever and deceptive ways to keep it challenging for a 5 year old.It glows in the dark as advertised, but for some reason the luminous image mirrors the dragon and castle, but not the knight on his horse. A smaller dragon shows up at the bottom right corner instead.Too bad it's not sold by ecom.com with free shipping. It's very inexpensive, but the shipping exceeds the item price!"

It is pretty boring too, but it does present some interesting facts.Dollar a Second - I already had this particular episode on another DVD, but this was by far my favorite thing on this DVD."

__label__1,"HORRID!: I recently watched this movie, what a piece of garbage. I thought Wood Harris was plain awful...downright painful to watch as Hendrix. I was sick of his darting tongue and his constant cheezy grinning during the concert scenes. The guitar playing "" simulation ""was even worse. The real Hendrix was not like this at all!!!. I should have suspected the movie would suck, because no one can cheapen a film like Billy Zane. Once I recognized him behind that huge mustache, I should have stopped watching. I blame this one though, on Wood Harris..he was just terrible."
__label__2,"Fabulous book!: ""The Clinton Years"" is a fabulous book with countless, priceless photographs of the Clinton Presidency. There are a wide variety of photographs documented in this book, which reflect Bill Clinton's leadership in the White House over the last 8 years, that are inspiring. The images of William Jefferson Clinton shown are not only in the role of President, but as an individual as well - showing the human side of our President.As they say, ""a picture is worth a thousand words,"" that most certainly is the case with this book!"

Utterly without point or value this ""psychological thriller"" will only scare you into never taking a chance on an indie ""horror"" film again. The people trying to find symbolism in this snoozefest are grasping at straws. I would like to be a millionaire just so I could use my money to keep this writer or director (whoever is responsible for this travesty) from ever working in film again."

__label__2,"Versatile Radio with Extra Power: I needed more coverage than the typical FRS radios provide. I work with people outdoors in hilly terain, reliable communications is vital, so I tried 4 of these SX800R radios from Mot. They where easy to set up and use. The crew trained up in less that 5 minutes. They provided the extended coverage needed and worked reliably. Fast recharge and day long battery life was just what we needed.The FCC has a quick and pain free way to get the license to operate at the higher power levels of GMRS. Still in use today and very handy."

__label__2,"Well-stocked minus one: A well-stocked anthology of this 1960s UK band including their two mega-hit, ""Groovy Kind of Love"" & ""Game of Love"", along with some lesser UK and US singles. Curiously omitted, though, is the punchy ""It's Getting Harder All the Time"", the number the Mindbenders performed as the dance band in the film ""To Sir with Love""."
__label__1,"Twisted Scripture: Gwen has some good principles in her book, but she consistently takes scripture out of context. I remember laughing out loud at some of her mix-ups. You WILL lose weight if you follow her method (only eat when your stomach growls), but I think there are much much better ways than waiting until your body tells you-- ""Hey, I'm starving!"" She claims the headaches will eventually go away, but my body must be the exception to the rule because the headaches never went away.I would seriously consider researching (just type Gwen Shamblin and cult into google.com) her before buying this book and contributing to her self-made, self-proclaimed church/movement."
__label__1,"I don't get it: I agree with others who find the premise of the book interesting. However, I couldn't help thinking while reading this book that the author was creating the story line as she went along. In my opinion the plot is quite haphazard, with arbitrary meaningless subplots, pointless plot contrivances, and no real sense of closure at the end. If it's meant to be a prolonged ""slice of life"" type of story, then it's not a very good one. I forced myself to listen to the entire book in the hopes of discovering the magic which is keeping it on the bestseller lists. A complete letdown."
__label__1,"Buyer Beware!!: Be certain that you know what you are buying. This antenna came highly recommended by other ecom reviewers, but it has a serious shortcoming. While it is an attractive unit and is easy to install, it is UHF ONLY. I receive two of the three major networks in perfect HD. ABC, however, is missing, as is the local PBS. I talked with a technician at PBS about my problem. In his professional opinion both UHF and VHF are necessary for adequate HD reception. As I understand it from him, what I really need is an antenna which resembles a 747. Prices for these are similar to that of the DB4. So, be certain that UHF is all you will need before you order a DB4."
__label__1,Very disappointed: My 8 year old son bought the RipStik with his saving and I we hate it. He is good with skates and skateboards but can only ride this a couple of feet. I read the reviews on ecom and people said the product was great and how fun it was. He has tried to ride it and cannot get more than a few feet. I definitely do not recommend this product for a child. It says 8 and up but I would not even consider it unless they are in their high teens. I am very disappointed that he spent so much money and cannot ride it. The wheels spin forward and backward and in a circle at the same time. I tried to stand on it and had to hold the counter to keep my balance. It is very hard to balance because of the way the wheels spin. Would never buy this again.

__label__1,"Ambitious, yes, but ultimately a failure.: Ambitious but ultimately unfulfilling horror novel that attempts to capture Lovecraft's grasp of the horror of the beyond. Laidlaw starts with a good premise - a new-age writer who's really a con artist finds himself toying with something he doesn't understand - and adds some nice plot on top of it, but the book never really coalesces into anything all that satisfying. The three main characters all feel a little flat, and the ""action"" is too far-paced to keep things moving all the time, and just bunched enough to create a strange pace. What's more, it's pretty tough to describe the indescribable, and Laidlaw tries, but never really creates the atmosphere and dread and horror that someone like Lovecraft was so good at. It's not really that Mandala is a bad book, but it's ultimately disappointing, especially given all the hype it received; there's no doubt it's ambitious, but it falls pretty short of achieving the goals it sets for itself."
__label__2,"Great behind the scenes look at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics: The author was the public relations spokesperson for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus he had a great insiders perspective. He includes insightful insider stories. Great read!"
__label__1,"Don't even steal this book!: ""Guide"" is much too descriptive for the information in this book. I think the author just photocopied a list of wrecks and had them bound. There is a lot of wrecks in this book but VERY little information about them. If you're thinking about buying this book you can have mine."
__label__1,"Skews the hips: I bought this pillow because I'm pregnant and have been having back trouble. The problem is that when you're sleeping on your side and it's between your knees, your knees are aligned, but your top foot is now dangling, which pulls the hips out of alignment, and makes you even more crooked when you wake up. It's not a problem with this model specifically, but for all pillows like this. I wish I hadn't used it so that I could return it."
__label__1,"Terrible Product: We bought 2 of these, one for my twins' room and one for ours, and they are terrible. They leak if you try to move them (which trying to keep them away from my twins, happens every morning.) My carpet is soaked. One of them has already broken. Total waste of money."
__label__2,"Very helpful, but badly edited: The systems are very good.You will of course need to tune them, but I am generally very impressed.The prose is also very good, and I have much better insight about how to design systems like this.The only downside is that the code fragments in the book1) are not available for download on the web, which is just silly in this day and age;2) are very poorly edited; they contain syntax errors and obvious bugs.So poor technical editing, but great content."
__label__2,"12th Century Mystery a Great Read!: This Hawkenlye mystery (fourth in the series) is a must for those who enjoyed Ellis Peters's books. However, it stands on its own, with a fresh approach to medieval crime novels. The author provides an engrossing tale, finely drawn characters in Abbess Helewise and her friend, Josse d'Acquin, and a realistic sense of the time period."
__label__1,"This T.V. Sucks, but Shipping is excellent!: I originally gave this TV a one star yesterday because of the poor picture quality. I called Samsung Tech support and they told me to try inserting the HDMI cable to another port, as the port it was in is probably defective.When I plugged in the HDMI cable to another port.. boy... the picture just came to life. I guess the other port was defective. Take note that this TV has 3 HDMI ports!The picture is simply amazing! The default picture settings suck, and you have to calibrate everything in order to get the clearest and sharpest pictures. I am now keeping this T.V. I got this for 943.00 on April 3, and now it's up to $1,099! I lucked out!Great TV for a great price!"
__label__1,Adjustable Floor Mirror: The adjustable pole that attaches to the mirror is very weak and flimsy. The base is not very heavy. The screws around the mirror keep coming loose so they have to be tightened often to keep the mirror from moving.
__label__2,"Something for everyone: This surprisingly neutral book compares the enormous variety of religious beliefs throughout history, with particular attention paid to Christianity. While not an in-depth text, it will serve as an introduction to critically examining the development and spread of religion.Christians should definitely read his chapter on Christianity; Mencken considers the 1611 King James Version to be one of the most beautiful books ever written.While his chapter hypothesizing the origins of religion is rather speculative, any such hypothesis is bound to be - at the very least it will pique your interest in the subject. The chapter on the variety of religions is particularly interesting, as it attempts to show how the same general ideas were molded into vastly different beliefs; in particular, the section on the various conceptions of heaven(s) and hell(s) will definitely be engrossing to anyone."

I felt most of the words and ideas here are already overused and familiar. I myself have already used many of them, and I'm fairly new at this.If you're at all experienced in selling I'd probably try the sequel to this book, but as for me, I'll pass on that too."
__label__1,"Waste of MONEY!: Saw this on ecom & wish-listed it, went to store because it was cheaper by $6, opened it up before I left store, THANK GOODNESS. Household junk I know is in my kitchen somewhere. Put it back on shelf immediately. Don't be fooled by cute box."
__label__1,"No resolution of plot or character flaws: Since this book won the Delacourte Press contest, I kept telling myself there would surely be something redeeming about it. I read the entire book and still felt Charlie did not change in a positive manner, too many loose ends in the plot were left in a negative way with no resolution, and I did not LIKE Charlie at all--very important for a book aimed at teens. Beware the explicit language and sex. I will NOT put this one on my school library shelves!"
__label__1,"Eat-Man 6 Volume Box Set: Here is a wonderful example of someone taking a good manga and completely wasting it. As it stands, very little about this series is actually worth your time; The art is very nice, animated very smoothly and nice line work. Everything else, on the other hand, is pretty pathetic. The music is pretty jarring and doesn't fit the theme at all. The opening and closing songs are totally uninteresting, and both sequences are visually underwhelming. The characters are horribly two dimensional, a mercenary Damsel in distress? Give me a break. There is no character intorduction at all, so you can't really bring yourself to care about anybody, hero or otherwise. Since it is episodic in nature, you never really get any serious insight into Bolt's character, and all the characters that seem interesting are gone in the next episode."

This is not your typical Hollywood fluff film but an insiteful look at China of the past (and maybe still today). Marrying below your station was almost as ilicit as un-wed love. The consequences of both can be very harsh. If you like a movie where you never stop to say ""it's just a movie"" this historically immaculate, painfully touching and often amusing tale is for you. DPG"
__label__1,"Nice Idea, but not a very good system!: I was disappointed with this program that did not allow me to paste a picture of my item or scan a document into the inventory. Instead, I could only check off that a picture was taken and had to describe where it was stored. I'm sure if I move my documents that I won' t edit all the records with their new location.

The other works ok - but does not provide the run time advertised with a 120 lb rider on smooth, flat surfaces. I have been trying to work with Go Motorboards' customer support, calling daily, just getting bounced from voice mail box to voice mail box. This seems like a company run out of someones garage. For the $350 cost, you would expect more. I would not recommend buying this, and certainly not online, as you will loose your shipping costs when you are stuck returning it."
__label__1,"Book of critiques?: The book should be called The Encylopedia of My Fantasy Critiques. Who wants to buy a book full of critiques? What sort of overstuffed person would write one? Maybe if you want to try some fantasy stuff but first want to hear someone elses opinion, this may be good for you. In short, this book is badly mistitled."
__label__1,A far cry from the MDR-A44L: These headphones are extremely flimsy and lack the kick needed to accurately reproduce music and even speech. The Sony MDR-A44L was the benchmark of the vertical in-the-ear design. It's a shame that Sony discontinued the MDR-A44L in favor of the overly cheapened MDR-W08L.
__label__1,"As a Pilot and Mama, I'd Never Buy This Book: We got this book from our library for our airplane-obsessed nearly 2 yo. The illustrations are nice, but the 'facts' about fundamental things like the way a jet works are WRONG. This book perpetuates myths, helping to make another generation believe that airplanes can just fall from the sky. This book is a disservice to our children and I ABSOLUTELY do not recommend it."
__label__2,"Why have you not read this book?: I am always encouraging people to read this book. It's one of the first novels that truly shocked me in the end. I first came to know this book in highschool, and it still sits on my shelf. I re-read it often, and it's never lost on me.There is a reason that it's a literary masterpiece, and one of the best books ever penned!"
__label__2,"Bitter, party of one....your table is ready: Very fun book to read. Everyone will be able to relate to the things described, not just for bitter old men. Well written and worth your time and money. Easy and enjoyable to read."
__label__1,"Waste of Money and Time: This is not a good CD. No matter how hard these other reviews try to polish this turd, It is still a turd."
__label__1,Not too good: I have a 150 gallon tank and kept having my ph rebound. I had to use almost the whole bottle and I don't think I was supposed to. Ended up buying proper ph 7 and that seems to be doing the trick.
__label__1,"Do not buy this edition: This edition appears to be from an OCRed text that was not proof-read. Odd spacings, strange characters, missing words. The binding and paper is cheap.Stay away! (It's not even worth one star.)"
__label__2,"The Captain Has Her Heart and Ours ...: I bought this book because I was fortunate enough to have Ms. Salinas as my nurse and she told me she had just published her first novel. Normally, I don't read romances but when she described the story to me, I thought why not. I started the book at bedtime and had read 100 pages before I put it down.The story moves quickly and one can't help but fall in love with April and Trig. You feel April's pain when she gets her Dear John letter from her husband Todd, but admire her determination when she embarks on a lifestyle change as a traveling nurse. There are some interesting twists and turns in the plot, but you'll have to read the book to find out what they are.Ms. Salinas is a wonderful story teller and I look forward to her next book."
__label__2,Stylemaster 60 x 24 curtains.: I love them.They look so crisp. I put the panel between old curtains that I also love but that are sun damaged.I scrunched the old ones to either end of the rod. The smoke blue panel in the middle picks up blue in the old curtains beautifully.
__label__2,"Christmas year round!: My Husband bought this little countdown clock for me for Christmas last year. He knows how much I love the season and wanted me to be able to countdown year round. It was a little awkward to set up but once you have it going it is self sufficient. It allows me to drive my coworkers crazy by randomly telling them how many days until Christmas. I set it on kitchen window ledge and see it everyday. Now that it's been almost a year, I am getting excited to see it count down in the double digits!"
__label__1,"Bowl needs to be in freezer for a long time and mixing speed is too fast: I'm pretty down on this product for two reasons:1. The bowl is large and needs to be in the freezer for several days to get completely frozen.2. The mixing speed, even on the lowest setting, is too fast. This means that if your bowl is not completely rock-solid frozen, you are never going to get the ice-cream to freeze.I have a strong freezer (big GE Monogram), but invariably if you try to use the bowl and re-use it after less than 2 days, the ice-cream will never get to the desired soft-serve consistency before the bowl starts to thaw. This is a normal freezer with normal usage; if you have an extra freezer or can ensure that the bowl is going to get rock-solid, then perhaps this bowl will be OK for you, but if you want any sort of frequency to your ice-cream making (e.g. you want to make multiple flavors), then I think you might be better with a built-in compressor-freezer model."
__label__2,"MS-65 Book: Year in and year out, this is one of the better books on coins for new and experienced collectors alike. Could use some analysis on why certain coins are priced as they are. Also, could use more information regarding coin history."
__label__1,"Manufacturing Defect: I ordered this from ecom and received a set with about half the pieces having noticeable pits or marks. Some of the pieces had a rusty groove running most of the length. The design itself was ok, but the table spoons (or dinner spoons I suppose according to the box) were extremely large and heavy. The spoon might not fit in a small person's mouth. It's almost as large as the included serving spoon. The large forks and knives were very heavy too because the handles are very thick and round. Tone your muscles while eating your soup!"
__label__2,A Birthday 2 Remember: I really am glad i purchased this book and it was so accurate that my fiancee was so happy for his b-day to receive this book because he loves everything about this culture and their past and especially the weapons! he has a couple samurai swords he keeps at his house and since he's part asian he feels like this book really explained his cultures past. i will buy from this author again. thanks!
__label__1,"Perfect for Baby but not Everyday Use...: I purchased this bath mat mainly for my little one who just started using the ""big girl"" tub, however, even when it's used just for her it doesn't stay in place. It's super cushy and perfect for her while we're watching but if you're looking for something to use everyday I'd look elsewhere."
__label__2,"A great old movie: The movie arrived quickly and it was a pleasure to watch it once again. The only bad thing? I went to put it away after I watched it, and found we already had a copy!! :-)"
__label__1,"Lasted a few minutes!: I wanted to buy the Thermoworks (new and improved) thermometer, but ecom offered it through an outside vendor which charged a shipping fee... and this Tru Temp one seemed to have gotten okay reviews, so i went with the cheaper option.i received it this past week and used it last night on our steaks. it started off okay -- i took it out of the packaging, removed the tab that the factory put in to keep the battery from being used, and proceeded to use it. i was able to set the correct temperature on the display and saw that the temperature reading was going down once the probe went from the counter to the meat. i thought it was going to be ""set it and forget it"" but when i looked over about 5 minutes later, the display was blank. i tried the power button but to no avail. i then thought it may be the battery, but even with a fresh one, the power wouldn't turn back on!so unless you need a disposable thermometer that lasts only for a few minutes, move onto another brand!"
__label__2,"more than ""disco"": In the begining thier was house.......and before that thier was SALSOUL!!!! The root of house music started with salsoul. This cd captures some of the best songs that they produced. To say that this is just another disco cd, would be doing it a grave disjustice. It would be like calling the Mona Lisa just a painting or the statue of Dave just a rock. This is a compilation of the best dance music ever recorded. The blend of rebel rosing vocals and smooth lyrical contents with the monstrative rythems are timeless classics. My only regret is they didn't release all of thier gems out on one compliation. This is a must have for any disco, house, dance, or r&b collection."
__label__2,quantum readings: I ordered these books for someone else. They seeemed to be really interested in getting these books. I know for a fact they are enjoying them immensely.
__label__1,"It's okay, but doesn't sound like bellydance to me: I was hoping this would be techno or ambient versions of bellydance beats and a few songs are, but most are just Arabic pop sounding."
__label__1,"disappointing: It was for my grandson and it was poorly packaged. as a result, it was broken and he was disappointed"
__label__1,"Don't waste your money or more importantly, your time!!!!: The film is really rubbish, it had some great potential based on the previous Alien films, this ""prequel"" has let the rest down badly. Maybe there will be more to come and this is just the Jar Jar Binks of the prequels??In any case not worth paying for at any rate, if one of your friends has actually paid for the dvd/bluray then borrow it from them and when you are really bored and have no other options to spend your time doing something more interesting then watch it."
__label__2,Angel: Thank you for my video I received it quick and in good condition. Look forward to ordering more movies...
__label__1,"Refund Please:: The story of The Switch had remarkable potential, but the execution was trite and not very convincing. I found myself dreading it everytime I grabbed the book because the writing was tediously ordinary and the characters were superficial. I finished The Switch not because I was compelled by superb writing, but because I could not return it for a refund."
__label__2,"You're Panties are a Pistola!!!!!!: This album is a classic! The whole album rocks. Tracks 5,6,and 7 are probably the most difinitive moment on this album and it shouldn't be missed. I would have to say as an Incubus fan that that this is one monster of an album and I'm proud of Incubus for making an album like this. I listen to this album everytime I get off of work and it definitely makes my day."
__label__1,"NOT WORTH IT.: I've purchased many items from ecom and been pleased, but this pillow is rather flat, not very firm, and definitely not for a person who sleeps on their side. It was a bad choice. Do not rely on the brand name. I tried it, then gave to my daughter, who said she can't use it because it hurts her neck. Next, it goes to the dog."
__label__2,"Great Sheets!: Decided to spend a bit more than I was planning on my yearly ""Christmas Sheets"" (which are always flannel). I am glad I chose this soft, well-fitting set. They are definitely worth the money. The ""Butter"" color is really nice. Love them!"
__label__1,"Origami No. 1: The first book in a series of sixteen by Atsuke Nakata contained a few models that I have always enjoyed teaching children. These models are the cicada and the jewel box. Personally, I do not enjoy making houses or furniture such as an organ and bench which are also featured in this book. The book also contains a model for a hat, two different fish, a boat, and a simple purse."
__label__2,"Fantastic is not the word?: Roberta Flack's I'm the one is dynamic. From beginning to end it will make you melt. I'm The One let's you know just that, she is the one. Roberta puts lyrics to one of Grover Washington, Jr's songs (In The Name Of Love), this was beautifully done. ""Til the Morning comes"", oops excuse me, will make you(smile). This song embodies all the lovelies fo soft intimate passion that can only come out of a song, sung by Roberta. Wow!!!!!! ""There's more to love I know, then making love"", is the hook Roberta uses in singing this sweet love song (Making Love). As a musician I highly reccomend this album, for the love and joy of sweet, sweet, music, especially coming from Roberta Flack. Listen, the purchase of this disc will be a great investment."
__label__2,"Perhaps the very best?: With the exception of a few Chinese Artisanal teas, I would chose this as my favorite.I do drink lots of Foojoy Ooolong as well.Cannot beat the price at ecom.The expensive Brolly Black tea pales in comparison!"
__label__2,"Season three is still fresh: I'll be very honest, I watch season 1 and 3; They didn't have it in the store.Anyways, this season was extremely funny. Viv has a baby, Calton gets high on speed in his prom, Queen Latifa was in this season, we see a new look on Will when he comes back to Bel Air from his summer vacation in Phily, Phil runs for Judge. MUST SEE, you wont regret it"
__label__1,"Heartlessly left in the dark.: The novel's premise is that Australian poet Christopher Chubb perpetrates a literary hoax; he invents a new persona, Robert McCorkle, and submits pretentious poetry to a novice editor. The editor, who Chubb resents, publishes the work and is humiliated when the hoax is revealed. The reader is in for a bizarre twist when Robert McCorkle appears in the flesh and is a gifted poet.How is this possible? Who is lying, who is insane? Years later, this enigma confronts the narrator, editor of a poetry magazine. The editor has no empathy for the pathetic Chubb or the monstrous McCorkle; she only wants to read McCorkle's damn poetry. Well, good luck! The narrator and reader are both ready for a nervous breakdown at the book's conlusion. We are left to our own conclusions in this strange and unfulfilling story."
__label__1,"2002 only!!: well, really couldnt do anything with this, since it is fir FS 2002 ONLY... something that the description failed to mention... it wasnt much so not such a big deal but it still was a bit dissappointing though..."
__label__2,"Freddie at his peak: The first album I ever purchased of Freddie Hubbard was Hubbard/ Turrentine live, on CTI. I was hooked, and have amassed over 30 records by this departed jazz legend. This album features top notch jazz masters like Bobby Hutcherson & Joe Henderson, both whom I have had the pleasure to see live at the Lighthouse in Hermosa beach back in the 1970's. I've seen Hubbard live at least 10 times, and talked to him at Dante's' Jazz club back around 1980 or so. He went through his ups and downs in his long career, but the one thing Freddie had was that growl and wail in his trumpet tone that no one has yet matched. This album shows off a peak time in his performance life, with straight ahead bop. Body and Soul, Sky Dive and the Intrepid Fox are CTI mainstays from his monster catalog of trumpet works, and Freddie and these great musicians blow the roof off."
__label__2,"Worthy wine-related adventures: What could be more fun than finding and tasting unlikely wines in unlikely places? Not much, and this book is mostly a joy to read. It made me want to visit some of the same far-flung places and help cheer on the valiant winemakers doing such remarkable things. One exasperating thing about this book, though: the type is a deadly combination of tiny and pale, which makes it very tough on the eyes. Perhaps there wasn't enough ink on the press when my copy was printed, but it seems more like an intentional choice by a designer with the eyes of a 25-year-old rather than those of someone over 50. Too bad, because the words and stories deserve more prominence."
__label__1,Broke quickly: I bought one of these a long time ago and it lasted me for years. I loved it so when it finally broke I decided to get another one of the same brand and type. Boy was that a mistake. The new one broke within a few weeks. Pretty disappointing since I loved the first one so much.
__label__2,"Does the job: I've always had a fear of my guitar hitting the floor because the strap came loose. No more worries now. Pretty much no instructions, but was easy to figure out with a quick search on You-Tube."
__label__1,"UNIMAGINATIVE PHOTOS & TOO MANY USELESS CHARTS: Not a very good book. Some useful information, but too many charts that don't help you when you are out shooting and text that is redundant. Simply put, the author is not a very creative photographer.There are better infrared books on the market than this one. Save your money!"
__label__1,REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY BAD!: This has to be one of the most unexplainable successes of late. This movie is REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLY BAD!
__label__1,"Very poor design: The design of this case is nothing short of terrible. As all other reviewers have noted - and as all other users have no doubt experienced - the case does not securely hold the T3 and it allows the unit to slide from the case and onto the carpet - or cement - or car floor. In short, it is a piece of useless junk that an interested user should walk away from quickly.Other design faults - such as the nearly impossible way in which you must slide open the T3 to access the graffiti area - are merely irritants when compared to the fact that the case fails to fulfill its main function (that is to protect the T3)."
__label__2,Performed as advertised: Having recently gotten DSL and having two laptops I wanted to have internet access from both independently. This device allowed that and also I was able to share one printer on the same cable goind throught the router; a nice plus.Installation went smoothly and it was up and running in less than 30 minutes. Doc was good but read it through first.
__label__2,"The album's title says it all: You can tell they were tired from the craziness of the mania just by looking at their forlorn faces on the cover.Despite the beyond hellish touring they were doing in 1963 and 1964, along with all the appearances on TV shows and the countless photo shoots and radio interviews they were obliged to do, Lennon-McCartney managed to squeeze in more classic compositions on this album: ""No Reply,"" ""I'm A Loser,"" and ""Baby's In Black,"" for example, brought home the point that they were in burnout mode. The number of covers they included on this (7, counting the medley of ""Kansas City"" and ""Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey"" as two songs) was the most they had of any other album.Again, I tend to shy away from their earlier work (I like things from Rubber Soul onwards, except the ""White Album"") but I enjoy Beatles for Sale because of the depth of the Lennon-McCartney tunes."
__label__2,"Great FPS: Bought this after browsing for an FPS after having completed ""Deus Ex"" and wanting another.I agree with many of the good reviews below. I'm surprised that it didn't do better in the stores. Forget about the ""cute"" aspects (unless you like them) such as bunny slippers and sleeping potions. This is a great FPS with good weapons, funny bad guys and a great storyline.Absolutely plan on getting NOLF2 when it becomes available."
__label__2,"does the job, but noisy: got this for a super great price.its an antec basiq so its got only 1 fan, but the cables are long enough to reach all the components in the pc.only con is that the one fan is significantly noisy, so in a quiet surrounding you can clearly hear it.good thing is that it does the job well. thats what counts for me."
__label__1,CHEAP: Do not buy at all unless u want only a slingshot frame rubber breaks after 2 pulls. awfull velocity not as described.I guess u pay for a frame only!
__label__2,"Great sound, Perfect for classical music: These speakers sound very clean, and work very well together. They can't quite replace the need for a subwoofer, as the bass sounds a little forced. They're perfect for listening to classical music, which I do a lot of. The sounds is especially crisp for vocal and orchestral works. However, for hip-hop, which I also listen to, the bass is somewhat weak. Overall, a great deal!"
__label__2,"Family Plot: Hitchcock's last film, Very tongue in cheek funny and some classic Hitchcock camera angles. Dern and Harris are perfectly cast."
__label__1,waste of money: Remember being a kid and connecting two McDonald's cooky boxes by a string and using them as walky-talkies...? If so then know that these speakers sound worse than that!
__label__2,"Excellent Book!: This isn't going to replace any of your other travel books, but it definitely serves it's purporse: to tell you where all the hot spots in the major European party destinations are. I especially like the fact that it lists cheap and expensive spots so that you have a nice mix. It also lists a few restaurants and certain sights that you shouldn't miss in each city. I hightly recommend this book to anyone who is traveling to Europe and wants to experience the nightlife."
__label__2,"Griffin is a success!: It works great, charges my ipod and broadcasts a clear signal. Only drawback is that it sometimes gets in the way of my gearshift, other than that its a great product."
__label__1,Clash of Orthodoxies: A serious subject addressed as a polemic. Selected quotes are set up as straw men and then attacked. Felt repetitive and unenlightening.
__label__1,"Bad language, much information: As the other reviewers say, it is obvious that the author as put alot of work into this book. It is huge.However, the author could have spent more time making it more readable. The writing is not good: sentences are often not comprehensible, and the punctuation is often confusing. In one passage, he tries to explain addition modulo 2, and says that the rule ""1+1=0"" is ""inspired by the fact that odd+odd=even"". It *is* precisely that fact, it is not merely ""inspired"" by it.In addition to the bad language, he often omits proofs, and is not rigorous in his definitions. The notation is often confusing.Certain parts of the book are good though - but only after reading them three or more times to understand what is really being said."
__label__1,Will never deal with the vendor again: I will never buy anything from this vendor again. Poor service and late delivery of the product.
__label__2,"GOOD GOD!: Granian....wowi recently discovered this artist on a Vertical Horizon discussion forum....and let me tell you, im beyond impressed. This CD is beyond amazing! Hard Driven acoustic sound and catchy melodies make this one cd not worth missing. Simply listen to ""uncovered"" and you'll see what im talking about. Granian, Keep up the amazing work"
__label__1,Cannot Install: I have Windows 98SE and this will not install. Support has not been helpful (nothing more than automated replies). Don't waste your money.
__label__2,"Lazy summer beach music great: Rhino compilations are usually interesting and this is one of the better samplings of South Carolina ""Beach Music"" -- the stuff enjoyed to during summer shore vacays. Definitely nostalgic -- the Drifters, the Coasters, Archie Drell, Clovers, etc., it's worth the listen many times over"
__label__1,"Not the battery as advertised: The battery received was not the brand name Ultralast which the company advertised for sale, but some un-labeled, no upc code, probably Chinese nockoff. I emailed seller and they agreed to return it but not worth the hassle to me. After reading lots of reviews I chose SF Planet to purchase from hoping to get the Ultralast brand, I was wrong."
__label__2,"great: Great container and blends in with the other stuff i got in the cabinet. I thought it had some shaving cream in it but was wrong, it's empty. A house guest threw it away and i had to dig it out of the trash. all is well."
__label__2,"TOTAL VALIDATION!!: This book is a total validation of the feelings and fears I experienced after the onset of my genetic illness. No one else understood, but JoAnn LeMaistre did, and finding that I was not alone in my experience and learning that there was a process I had to endure made things easier. I was so moved that I found JoAnn and joined one of her support groups! This is a must-read for people newly diagnosed AND their families. An illness never affects just one person - it affects that person's entire family in every aspect of their lives."
__label__2,"Nice for the price: Like other customers, mine had very small rust spots on the ruler, nothing that will be a problem. I'll probably spray it with some light oil before I put it in my toolbox, just so it doesn't rust any more. Most tool manufactures coat their raw metal parts with oil for this purpose. Also, the ruler was bowed just a bit, but I straightened it out myself. Hard telling if it happened at the warehouse, shipping, or just caused by temp extremes (it was real cold when it was shipped to me).As for construction, it's very heavy duty and well-constructed. I am pleased. List price says 17.99 (and regular price $9.26), but I received the ecom Gold Box deal for $6.99. Having seen and held the product, I would definitely spend $6.99 for this, again, if I needed another square, but I would not spend $17.99. I'm not sure if I would spend the $9.26... probably."
__label__2,"'Nother roaring delight from working men: Like the Johnny Collins collection it overlaps with, this is a great collection of sea chanteys sung in an appropriate rough roar and rowdy beat by men who work for a living. Great in their own right, and for singing along with on long drives to keep yourself awake.Not for those who only like perfect choral voices, but a great delight for those who like work songs with a strong rhythm and an occasional delight in old-fashioned naughtiness."
__label__2,Exceptional sound!: Bought this to replace a failed Sony Front Speaker for a TV room entertainment system. The sound coming from this little workhorse is a thing of beauty. Picks up dialogue perfectly and at the right volume. Would buy again.
__label__2,"Awesome resource for tips on the finer points of the game: I used to read these ""comic strip"" formatted tips in Baseball Weekly, and I thought they were awesome. I have watched and played baseball for years (even attending baseball summer camp), but I learned some great tips from almost every strip. I liked them so much that I started cutting out the strips and putting them in a photo album. I wanted to save them for my kids to read some day. Unfortunately, I only had about 30 tips saved. I was ecstatic when I saw that they were putting all of the tips into a book."
__label__1,"Another not easy to understand weather book: I was really excited when buying this book, because it looked like it will be easy read and I can finally understand the basics that I can use during my sailing trips.I found this book not very well outlined, and not easy to understand at all.I will keep looking for the one"
__label__2,"Excellent!!!!: This album has all my fav. A*Teens hits! It's a GREAT Album for all loyal fans and for all those that like great up-beat songs. It has some of their best Abba singles, ""Dancing Queens"", ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Gimmie,Gimmie,Gimmie"". And their recent #2 hit in Sweden ""I Promised Myself"". The album also has some nice soft POP songs like ""Perfect Match"", ""Sugar Rush"", ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" and ""Heartbreak Lullaby"". It also features party hits like ""Floorfiller"". Their Top 100 Billboard Hit ""Bouncing off the Ceiling"" and new material. This album rocks and should be a great present to anyone from the young to the seniors. I give this album a 9.8/10 overall."
__label__2,Absolute requirement for Texas hot summers!: Love our new toaster oven. Just the thing for cooking for two during our hot Texas summers without heating up the whole kitchen. Hope this one lasts for many years.
__label__2,Both alluring and captivating: Prolific performing artist Paul O'Dette continues to delight and surprise us with these compositions of another time and place. Both alluring and captivating.Rated four and a half to five stars.Ken Cybulska
__label__2,"Great heater: This heater works great, but only for a single room at a time. I live in a two bedroom apartment and only one of those two rooms is used at night. So what I do is turn down the thermostat to about 60-62 and use the heater in the room with the door closed. It keeps it nice and warm."
__label__1,"Not done watching, but...After 7 episodes-: I just do not like the main character.The only person who seems to like him, is his Mother.His ex-girlfriend hates him, his brother is furious with him, his father is dissapointed with him.Nobody (actors, seem to have a clear line on who they're supposed to be).So far, after 7 episodes,for the first Season, I don't know who, or what anyone is either.Is the owner of the general store, just a stone beetch? Is the IRS auditor just a stone beetch?There is so much good TV. I do not have time to try to figure out what the writers of this show were trying to get across. In my opinion, they had a dart board in their office, and threw darts at it, to see which ones stayed.I'm definately, not willing to watch 18 or so hours of this floundering program."
__label__1,"Really!?: I'm a big Lovecraft fan so I thought this could be a good flick due to the fact that there really isn't a lot of true to form movies dedicated to the author. What a disappointment! Horrible acting, & no special FX whatsoever, if you're a fan of actually seeing Lovecrafts mind come to life forget this one. Also, I do not recall anything homosexual that was written by Lovecraft but they sure cranked it up in this one without advance warning at the time of purchase. I have nothing against others sexual orientation but this has nothing to do with Lovecraft. If you like watching guys make out together & making an extremely feeble attempt at scaring you while loving each other than this one is for you! Lovecraft never wrote a romance... period, why throw that in the storyline whether it's gay or straight???"
__label__2,"Ideal For Real Estate: As a real estate agent, I am always looking for an edge over my competition and the opportunity to offer my clients more. Since 84% of buyers use the Internet to search for properties, photos can make or break the interest of consumers.So, I decided to purchase the Sony VCL-0630X wide lens for my Sony DVD405 camcorder (The camcorder is also a camera). It was a wise decision. It produced a wider shot of the rooms. Normal photos can make a room look smaller than it really is. The wide lens made enough of a difference to be worth the purchase.I also priced around, and found it priced the lowest on ecom.com."
__label__1,"Terrible Filter Design: I have owned this vacuum for a few years and have grown to like the theory but hate the execution. The lift off aspect is very convenient for tight places, cars, etc. The suction is quite powerful. Those are the good aspects.The bad part is the filter design. Simply put, to keep this vacuum operating properly the dust cup must be constantly emptied. Don't be fooled by the full line on the dust cup. By the time it becomes that full all the filters will be clogged beyond recognition with dirt. To make matters worse, cleaning these filters is time consuming at best. The unit also likes to blow dust out of the back and from other areas, regardless of how full the dust cup is and how dirty or clean the filters are. This unit has a poorly designed filter that only works (and even then not all that well) when the dust cup is empty and all the filters are clean.Don't make the mistake of buying this unit. There are much better vacuums on the market."
__label__1,New book: I purchased a new copy of Soul Happy and the book I received looks used. That's all I have to say.
__label__1,"Lasted for 8 months: I bought this Sony Walkman in September 2007.From Day One, I found that Weather & TV didn't work at all.But I kept using this product because FM radio & Cassette Player were working well & these functions were more important than the rest.It totally broke down early this month, June 2008.What should I do with this product? Any suggestion?"
__label__1,Is suggested as a case for the Sony Handycam - doesnt work: When I purchased the Sony Handycam ecom suggested this case for it. It does not even fit the camcorder. Just watch what accesories they suggest you buy.
__label__1,"Not good! too loud and slimy: Had a petmate fresh flow for years without any issues, then had to buy this as last resort. It looks cool, but it's so noisy! I often turn it off just to give my head a rest. Reason for noise is that the filters clog up every week and it gets so slimy each week too unlike my petmate fountain. It's supposed to flow evenly all around the globe but it just dribbles at the back. This design blows. I am going to send it back to the makers and have American Express refund me.

__label__1,Is anyone else tired of Eminem?: I dont know what this guys deal is but every year he gets worse and worse. What is he rapping about? What is he rebelling against? Why is always angry? Whatever it is hes almost got me convinced that platinum selling rich white boys have it rough. But now Eminem has a whole new crew full of guys that dont really do anything but try to look thugged out in his videos. Hopefully Eminem can drop his own White Album and stay out of the game just like Jay-z for the rest of his life and make the hip hop world happier.

__label__1,"YUGO junk printer-light use and an early death: I guess I should be happier based on the reviews that this printer even made it to the three year mark, but it was so lightly used, it still looks brand new. As most people have commented, it seems to use a lot of very expensive ink. Now, the paper feeder just stopped working and the printer is basically a paper weight. I work in IT and so I am used to working with HP printers many of which last 15-20 years or more.After only using this one so little over three years, it really still looks new. Its a shame, because all of the other parts on it look and seem new. But, needing a new feeder will likely cost way more than the $50 I paid for this (it came bundled with a Black Friday deal). I see you really do get what you pay for-a disposable printer that will likely fail with an early death even if barely used. For my next printer, I will invest in an HP which will usually last 3-4 times as long and cost less in ink to operate."

The only issue, as with all racks other than roof racks, is that the bikes can scratch a lot , I removed one of the bike supports to convert it in a 3 bikes rack instead of 4 bikes. That way i was able to protect better the bikes, doing this I avoided the bikes touching each other. I have a rav4 with roof racks but I just ordered a hitch for it to use this rack as well on it, this way now I can carry 6 bikes securely on my car on group weekends rides and enjoy friends even on the ride to the trail and load gear on the back of the car without dismounting bikes every stop to pick up a rider"

It does work flawlessly with Adobe Acrobat 6 Professional. Easy to switch between letter and legal sizes so it's ideal for anyone needing to email PDFs from the road that involve anything with legal size paper. I scanned about 20 documents, tried it again a couple months later and got black bars on the scans. This is my last Pentax product."

__label__1,"huge dissappointment for fans of the first 2: This movie shouldn't be called The Godfather part 3 because the main characters are completely unrecognizable from the first 2. The most complelling aspect of the first two movies was how a very intelligent Michael evolved from a bright eyed bushy tailed kid to a suspicious ruthless man capable of murdering his own brother and how the sins of his father doomed him to this fate. In part 3, without explaination Michael is suddenly a redemption seeking softy wanting to make peace with his enemies and Connie of all people becomes the hawk of the family. The movie would have been better if it had been about how they made this evolution so as to connect it to the first two movies. Throw in the Vatican and Coppola's daughter and it's just too much to swallow."

By the time we received the motor it had already been a month since purchase. Was concerned about the quality of the rest of the bike and decided to return it. It's now almost a month since I returned the bike and I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REFUND FROM ecom. ecom should stick to books. I will never purchase anything except books through ecom again.

__label__2,"Love 'em: I bought these as a replacement for the white earbuds that came with my iPod. I wasn't happy with the iPod's headphones because they tended to fall out and were uncomfortable after a while. These do neither. They're very comfortable and block out outside noise very well. Sound quality is great. The iPod's earbuds didn't fit into my ears very well, so I didn't get much bass output. In comparison, the Sonys have more than enough.I also like the ""stealth"" factor. Since the cord is black, no one knows I have a $300 iPod in my pocket anymore!"

Maybe I can start eating in a healthier manner.

They help mix the batter and enjoy breaking the waffles apart into the ""stix"" so they can dip them into the syrup. Clean up is easy and we have not had any problem with sticking waffles. Not as easy as tossing a couple of eggos in the toaster but it's great for a fun family breakfast on Saturday morning. The included recipe booklet has a nice buttermilk recipe which makes very tasty waffles.Note: measure out the recommended cup of batter per waffle. If you overfill the grids you will have a doughy half-cooked mess to clean up. No kids are going to stick around to help you then either!"

Why did they? I have no idea. The ending just baffled me...*spoiler* why did he walk onto the spaceship? HUH? Maybe I was just having a bad day, but it really made no sense to me. I was alternating between bored and frustrated at not understanding the 'plotline'.Quite a poor effort, conclusively...this movie was weak."

__label__1,Pediflex Double Toes Straightenen #P57: Product is very poorly designed. You need to tighten the strap around the toes so tight that you get pain. Otherwise is comes off with a few footsteps. Additionally the strap is positioned at the same location (or directly side-by-side for the two toes) when the joints of the toes are not side-by-side. I probably should rate this no stars because I can't use it.
__label__2,"Not quite what I expected: Johnny Cash wrote two autobiographies. Cash takes up where his first left off. This is not an autobiography in the sense it takes the reader from point A to point B to point C in a chronolgical order. It's bits and pieces from here and there and in no real order. Little anecdotes, about the time Faron Young, during a car accident, got his tongue wrapped around a steering wheel and the strange thing is, two weeks before Johnny had said to him, ""If you don't stop swearing, the Lord will jerk that tongue out of your mouth."" Touching anecdote about impulsively entering a church service and sitting next to an excited boy who announced to everyone he was so certain Johnny Cash was going to sit in the same pew as him and his family. At some parts, I laughed until tears came to my eyes. I could almost hear Johnny speaking the words of the book and he has quite a sense of humor."

__label__2,"Involution as high literary art: a masterpiece.: I am hoping that all of you have read this incredibletale, and if you have not, I urge you to do so immediately.Nabokov fills this narrative with brashly erotic images, andexamines the complications involved in living as an author.The process of living one's life through one's own writing,and trying to live in a society where engaging in what youfind valuable is punishable by incarceration, are themesdeeply interwoven into the simple fabric of the story. Idon't want to spoil the story for you, so I will notilluminate the plot, but even without a plot, the sheerdepth and complexity of the characters and narrative formwould be sufficient to make this a master work. If youhave time to read only one novel this month, this should bethe one, and if you have already had the pleasure of readingNabokov's Lolita, I recommend reading it again.

I'm pretty sure it's the cheap plastic threading; now they are worn out because I've had to screw the thing in so many times. What an irritating, cheap product.I did try seeing if the other threaded pieces that came with the filter would work, thinking maybe I did not pick the right size to begin with. Nope. I picked the only one that will work.I wish I had kept my old PUR filter. Sure, it was hard to change the filters but it never fell off.When it works, the water is good."
__label__2,"A GOOD TOOL FOR THE CONVERTED...: ...but not a book that's going to change anyone's mind. David Corn makes no bones about his contempt for George W. Bush and his policies - the title alone will probably keep any real Bush supporters from reading this work, which is a pity. It's very revelatory, if a little dry at times. As another reviewer correctly pointed out, after a while, it gets to be a little `list'-like - although Corn's information is presented clearly and the book as a whole is organized well. He follows Bush from his candidacy, his appointment by the Supreme Court, his administration both before and after the 9/11 attacks, up through at least part of the war on Iraq.The book seems well-researched - there are no footnotes or endnotes (although there's an index, which is helpful when using the book as a reference), but Corn mentions his sources as he goes along. I certainly came away from the book with the impression that the author has done his homework, and that he's dedicated to his task."

This book only presents the delirium of an addict and stressful sad person.

__label__2,Over and over: This one of my all time favorites. It's a movie I can and do watch over and over. It's a great story and of course excellent acting. I also always enjoy any DVD with a commentation. It always adds to the enjoyment of the story and of how the movie was made.
__label__2,"Solid As A Rock: I love this product. Shortly after getting my Garmin, the supplied windshield mount kept falling off my windshield at random moments (sometimes it would stick for an hour, sometimes just 5 minutes).The center portion of my dashboard is humped, so this friction mount doesn't even sit flat, but that doesn't matter. It has never slid or moved even a little bit on the numerous times I have used it. It sits there like it is super glued to the dashboard, but when I stop, I simply lift it off the dashboard and tuck it under my front seat.It works exactly like I had hoped it would."

But don't worry, that was about 3 years after i got it. It plays good, the menus are exceptional, but i am wondering why anyone would want this, when you can get the Mp3 / disc player from Philips for twenty dollars more. They are 20 times more high-tech, the menus actually give you the titles of song names (at least most of them) and they truly are jogproof. This is barely jogproof. It only has 45 second shock proof while the new mp3 disc player i got has unlimited. Trust me, you'll be happier if you left this one alone"

__label__2,"Fabulous, unforgettable, unflappable Foyle...a great gift for your WWII buff: If you like historical fiction, Foyle's War is for you. Great writing, intriguing plots, excellent actors, and absolute authenticity--you simply can't ask for more. The first series is a bit slow, the solutions to the murders a tad too obvious, but bear with it. By the second series, the plots increase in complexity. What I liked best about Foyle's War was that it was not your usual WWII fare. Each episode was thoughtful, insightful and rich in emotional depth. The realism with which the British war experience was portrayed was astonishing, and the characters were so well developed they truly came alive. By the end of the series, the laconic Foyle will have become a member of your family (along with the irrepressible Sam). My only complaint is that there weren't a hundred more episodes. I could have watched Foyle forever."

I wasn't sure if the original King & I film would hold their interest, and was excited to see this animated version. Do NOT waste your time on this cartoon. It is horrid. There are a couple characters that are really grating and annoying (a monkey (cringe) and an ""Ah-so"" stereotype-Charlie Chan-without-the-brains-buddha-shaped-bald character). I thought MAYBE the music would redeem the film, but during each song there are so many busy, noisy, pratfalls and slapstick that you can't even enjoy the songs! They've gratuituously added dragons, hot air ballons, rescue scenes, unfunny ""humor,"" (all presumably to hold the kids' interest) but it just gets on one's nerves. My kids did not care for it, either."

__label__1,"Try another drawing book first!: I have taught drawing on a college level for approximately 25 years and this book is about the least helpful one I have encountered. The reader is asked to devote time to ""cute"" cartooning and therefore spends less productive time on the more important aspects of learning to draw. I do not think cartooning itself is wasted time; some of the world's greatest draftsmen have been cartooners. Learning to look at something with full consciousness is the basic trick to drawing what one is seeing, and far too little time is devoted to avenues for achieving that result in this book. The illustrations are not the best, suggesting a less-than-stellar result for the reader. Even picking up a book of great drawings with no instruction included would be a better way to learn to draw, in my opinion. For solid instruction, however, look at books by Betty Edwards, Robert Beverly Hale, Kimon Nicolaides, Daniel M. Mendelowitz, or Nathan Goldstein."

__label__2,"Exciting and Scary, Full of Surprises too!: I think the second Harry Potter book is not quite as good as the first book, probably because J.K.Rowling did not have as much enthusiasiam on the book, and because she had pressure writing it. I still think it's a great book, though. It all starts when Harry ruins the Dursleys' formal Dinner party, and the Dursleys decide his punishment will be to not go to Hogwarts. Luckily, with some help from Ron and his brothers George and Fred Weasley, he escapes and moves in with the Weasleys. He then gets in a lot of trouble at Hogwarts,and then he and his friends hear that all the muggles will be sent from Hogwarts! When Hermione is attacked,Harry oathes to find out what happened.

I have played tons of other Miles' albums on the same system and most of them sound great - especially the Columbia/Sony releases, remastered or not.I strongly recommend the ""Highlights from Plugged Nickel"" instead, unless you don't mind hearing the great(est) Jazz live performance using one ear."

And Ants Marching (Track #7) is one of THE feel-good songs of the DECADE! This CD can evoke a range of emotions, all of them necessary, and good."
__label__2,"Lovely blend of 70s styles: This is a lovely blend of late 70's styles like disco (Hot Chocolate), big ballads (Rex Smith), wistful pop (John Paul Young, Robert John), power pop (The Knack), atmospheric rock (Nick Gilder), catchy singalong pop (Quattro & Norman) plus a couple of lesser known but still great tracks by Ian Gomm, Nicolette Larson, etc. I remember 1978 as a great year for good music in which singles sales reached a record high, in a decade that I consider the golden age of pop music. Even dance music had personality then and wasn't just mass-produced 4 beats to the bar anonymous variations on a theme. My favorites here include the tense, erotic ""Hot Child"", the dreamy, hypnotic ""Love Is In The Air"", the poppy disco of ""Everyone's A Winner"" and the sensitive ""Sad Eyes."" Vol. 22 makes a valuable contribution to an excellent series."
__label__1,"Lori, Angry Activist, Rhoda, Imprisoned Mother: This is a very strange memoir of a mother obsessed with her daughter's imprisonment in a faraway land for alleged terrorist activities. I don't know whether she committed these acts but the photograph of Lori on the cover of the book makes me wonder: Who is Lori? In any event, she looks like a sadist, not a human rights activist. Rhoda spends the entire book complaining about injustices, with a capital I--and her plane trips to Peru."
__label__1,Idk: I ordered a movie but when i got the mail i recived perfume instead i have no idea how that happens its not even close to being the same .... if i would have got another movie i think i would have understood but perfume is not even close .... I know other ppl who have had problems with this also so ill be going else where ....
__label__2,Dogs love it!: I have 3 pitbulls and they each love these vitamins. They are shaped like capsules but are chewable tablets. I have been searching for a vitamin with omega 3s that was chewable for a long time so when I came across these I had to try them out. No complaints. The dogs coats are looking great. It has helped alot with dandruff and dry skin.
__label__2,"Utterly brilliant, moving: I've had this album for five months now, and I still can't stop listening to it. You can't keep your feet still on the faster songs, and the slower songs are dreamy and beautiful. The riffs aren't necessarily original, but like the blues, they are eternal, and reworked here magically. If you like 60's psychedelia rock, with a foundation of rhythm acoustic guitar, and with keyboard and electric embellishments, you will love this. The lyrics are good, too. Unlike most self-important rockers nowadays, these guys have a sense of humor."
__label__1,"A Total Waste of Money: My 3yo son received a Razor Kiddie Kick scooter for his birthday, and it is such a piece of junk that we ended up throwing it away. He was so disappointed too, he had waited for months to get the scooter...the wheels have NO BEARINGS, just a plastic ring that rubs against the inside of the wheel and makes it impossible for the scooter to coast along, so he had to push and push and the scooter went so slowly that he got frustrated and finally gave up. We tried to replace the wheels with regular Razor wheels, but they are a different size, so we couldn't even fix it. We then contacted Razor, by phone and by email, and explained our disappointment, but they didn't return our calls or our emails.All in all, this scooter was a total waste of time and money."
__label__2,"Entertaining and Endearing: General Greywolf leads a cast of ""a thousand"" intriguing and endearing creatures (mostly elves) in a war against the Evil Dark Lord who is set on invading the idyllic land of Tir-na-nog. When the charming Goddess Diana enters the scene, Greywolf looses his heart even as he wins battles. If you loved Flash Gordon, the movie, and enjoy mythology as much as romance, then let Dark Lord enchant you. I was highly entertained and found myself charmed by a certain Pegasus."
__label__1,"Old news footage - in words: I'm only just begining Chapter 6, but my impression so far of the book is that it is heavy on describing the news footage of what most of us have probably already seen and heard on CNN or the FOX News Channel. This is interspersed with situational dialogue involving, of course, the President, Rumsfeld, Rice, etc. I hope it gets better. What I hope to read in the remaining Chapters is information I and the public have not been commonly privy to. That's what an investigative reporter provides, or so I thought."
__label__2,no easy money: For anyone who may think trading is easy and the rewards are great - think again. Martin Schwarts makes it clear that 99% of trading success is hard work and discipline. There are no free rides in the market.
__label__1,Not worth it- breaks too easy: We had one for years that saw limited use. Started using it more often and it broke- top handle lost a tab that keeps the handle attached. Bought a new one and it lasted three weeks then broke the same way. Tab broke and the handle no longer keeps the spring in place. Looking for a new solution...
__label__2,"She's amazing!: When I first heard Diane Schuur ten years ago on a computer software support hold line, I ran out and bought every CD I could find. I've been buying them all since. This latest album has not disappointed me. One of the best things in life is to hear one of my favorite vocalists portray some of my all time favorite songs, like ""Good Morning Heartache"", ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". You can hear that Diane has put her heart and soul into these tracks. Ms. Schuur, you shine!"
__label__1,"BAD PICO 75 amp switch: PICO 75 amp switch, It works for one day only and have to replace it with another one 50 ampThis is the second switch I have to replace from PICO in short timeBAD quality...I do not recommend it for any one"
__label__2,Sima SVS-4: This AV switch works great. Have had it for ~4yrs and not a lick of trouble with it. It automatically switches to the active or most recent active input. Has both RCA and S-Video connectors for video inputs and outputs and will convert between the two types of connections - something the less expensive switches won't do. I really like the SV-4 and need another one but not sure if it's still manufactured or what the replacement is at this date.
__label__2,"Season three is still fresh: I'll be very honest, I watch season 1 and 3; They didn't have it in the store.Anyways, this season was extremely funny. Viv has a baby, Calton gets high on speed in his prom, Queen Latifa was in this season, we see a new look on Will when he comes back to Bel Air from his summer vacation in Phily, Phil runs for Judge. MUST SEE, you wont regret it"
__label__1,"This printer is a nightmare.: I've owned this printer for about a year and have had to replace the ink cartridges numerous times (I don't even print that much!). It's very temperamental too: Some days the printer will work wirelessly and some days it refuses to cooperate. For a while, we had to connect with the printercord to be able to print. And finally, it has now decided to just stop printing in black even though there is a new ink cartridge installed. Also, the print quality, especially for color prints, is ""smudgy"", that's the only word I can think of to describe it--not crisp at all. I hate the printer. I bought the Epson Workforce 845 today and connot wait to through this one out the window!"
__label__2,"Impressive Improvement: Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven was an extreme improvement over its prequils. It's the first Might and Magic game to have an actual 3D world.Some may critisize the use of 2D sprites in the game. The reason for this is to save memory. At some point in the game literally hundreds of enemys could be in the area at a time, and to use 3D objects would take up too much memory.The thing I was dissapointed in was the roster. You can only have human characters, the ninja class no longer exists (I love ninjas), and you can't change your current pary (like in all the previous MM titles). Other than that it's very fun to play for hours."
__label__2,"The Bible of the Genus Crocus: For such little plants, crocuses have inspired a lot of wonderful monographs. Maw, Elwes, Mathew and now Ruksans have all had their hand at telling the story of this amazing group of spring harbingers. Mathew's is likely to endure as an especially significant monograph since his is the first to capture the far more systematic exploration and travel that has occurred where most crocuses grow throughout the Balkans, Greece and Turkey that have taken place in the latter half of the Twentieth Century. The art throughout this book is exquisite and the production values are very high. It is a mystery to me why Timber Press has not issued a second printing! If you are a crocus lover, this is a book to track down!"
__label__2,"A Must Read: This book is a little hard to read due to the difference in the way folks spoke back then vs. now. This book showed me that the politics of the late 1700's and now aren't really that different. It was the haves vs. the folks who want to work to better themselves with policies made at the highest level to keep good hard working folk down. ""SOUND FAMILIAR""?"
__label__2,Love it!: Works great! I always grew up with a hot-air popcorn popper. One suggestion is to let it run/warm-up for about a minute before you drop the kernels in...helps with the popping. Enjoy!
__label__1,Horrid Pump...: Do not buy.. The pump nozzle does not work correctly on average bike wheel air nozzles. I could not get this pump on now matter which way I tried to outfit it on the wheel nozz. Also the pump is much smaller than the picture fitting in the palm of my hand meaning the range of the pump will deliver very little air per pump. Depending on how much pumping you have to do (if you can even get the nozzle on) you will be pumping for quite a while.
__label__2,A perfect match for the new Radio Flyer Wagon: The umbrella arrived in a box much larger than the box the wagon was in.It is a perfect matach for the wagon.The clamp is strong and holds well to the wagon.

__label__1,"Awful. Simply worthless: Being an EMS provider for 11 years, I was eager for this movie to come out. Holy lord, was I disappointed. The plot was horrible, the acting was shamefully bad, and the audio for the dialogue sounded like everything was dubbed over. Terrible movie altogether."
__label__2,"""The Secret"" copied this book: This book is very good but it's not worth 100 bucks. Buy The Secret"" for 30 dollars and use your imagination on the rest. The Secret copied this book and put it's own twist on it. Basically, this a great book that details the secret."
__label__1,"Disappointing: A Slick Re-Packaging of Warmed-Over Ideas: Granted, Hamel is a strategy genius. But there is little in this book that you haven't read before, either by him or others, both in books and the numerous e-commerce magazines. The book has a cool, revolutionary design but its content can be grasped just by reading through the sub-headings. This is a good refresher course on what companies need to do in the face of the Internet revolution sweeping the business world. But those who haven't already got the message are unlikely to ""get it"" from Hamel's hectoring and rah-rah enthusiasm. If you already ""get it"" then you really don't need this book."
__label__2,"Good Vitamin D Caplets: These are the same ones that you would find in any Walgreens or CVS. I would suggest waiting to buy them in the store because they typically go on sale to ""BOGO"" or ""BOGO half off"". This was very convenient as it saved a trip to the store."
__label__1,"get a different one: I didnt buy this, but rather won it at a company picnic. It is nice that it does mp3 and jpgs, but almost all players do now adays. what it lacks is, a good dvd player though. I seriously watched ""the great outdoors"", an classic comedy with not too much action, and several time the picture became pixelated because the player couldnt handle it. Half way through ""mulholand drive"" I took it out and put it in my old panasonic player (at least 3 years old) where it played perfectly. beyond that, it is slow at opening the door (not too big of a deal), has a terrible midget remote, and a display that doesnt show time elapsed or anything else. you can get a much better player for the money."
__label__2,"Great movie! Only one thing...: So I really liked this movie. The acting was great but I felt there could be a little more action and suspense!! I thought the main part of the movie was getting the children safe so the trains do not hit. That part was only 5 minutes. Kind of disappointing. I felt that more trains could be blowing up and people getting hurt/saved. I needed a little more action. Other than that, I would recommend watching the movie (and buying it used on ecom). It's a fun watch! :)"
__label__2,"One of the HEAVIEST records of all time!!!: If you are a true fan of heavy music, do yourself a really big favor and get this record. The first two songs are some of the baddest rock-n-roll ever made. I searched for this CD for ten years and when I finally found it, it was EVEN BETTER than I remembered. ROCK OUT!!!"
__label__1,"The Fairy Tale is Over Success Was Not Achieved Here: Retelling fairy tales we all grew up with is a sensational idea which has been done extremely well. Just not here! In other books yes, but here unfortunately no. The stories in this book do have one thing in common with the original motive of fairy tales. They will put you to sleep. These are some of the most boring low quality stories ever written. Also avoid the books A Wolf at the Door and Snow White Blood Red edited by Ellen Datlow as they are no better than this.If you do want really good retelling of classic tales rewritten in sensational format buy Once Upon A Crime or Politically Correct Fairy Tales. You will find what you're after in those books."
__label__2,"Best Hoop Game Ever: Hey everyone listen up. I don't usually write these reviews, but I do check them out before buying a $50 game. This is by far and away the most original, fun and all around best basketball game I have ever played. I used to love going down to the arcade to fire my quarters into the NBA Jam machine. This game, while somewhat similar is very different. The graphics are incredible, the game play is very easy to pick up and the all around layout and setup of the game is outstanding. This game is easily the best ps2 game I've played yet and this is coming from a die hard football fan who loves Madden too. EA Big really did an outstanding job on this one. Stop reading these reviews and get down to the local video game store with your $50."
__label__2,Go get this CD...Now...I'm Waiting...Why are you still here?: I just bought this CD and I'm kicking myself for not getting it sooner...Tyler's voice and songwriting is so awesome...I love the CD and every single song on it. Usually when I get a CD I skip over some songs or just listen to the one that I actually know but with this CD even if I didn't know the song I still had to listen...it's infectious.
__label__2,"Excellent Product, Reasonable Price: I purchased this item to enhance the addition of a laptop to my family of computers. I got a Hawking Technology PC card to go with. Setup went flawlessly and I was networking in 30 minutes. And I may know my way around a computer but I'm no networking expert. I would highly reccomend this product for someone who wants to share one broadband connection but doesn't require the intra-computer file transfer be at a lightning speed that the ""G"" network would offer."
__label__1,Too small: It was too small for the tacoma. Direct me to a longer one.As a result splash of mud is still coming back on the back section. How can this be corrected.
__label__1,"a head scratcher....: How does a band go from an album like 'Wind and Wuthering' to this pap. The songs on this CD are Collins-formula excrement. What happened to Tony Banks' integrity I'll never know. I hope he realizes that he is now a Pariah amongst original Genesis fans. Collins gets a pass, since he's just the drummer (and an amazingly good one at that, though you'd never know unless you went all the way back to Brand X), but Banks was THE songwriter. Change is not bad, per se, and good musicians try to always explore new ground - but new ground, this ain't. Take a lesson from Bruford, a truly great musician who ventures into unexplored territory with every project."

__label__1,Big disappointment: I'm sorry I purchased this. It is not what I had envisioned.....I wanted more authentic African music. African voices are magnificent...why not let them sing their own music?
__label__2,"Great for the office and beyond: The practical concepts offered in this book simply make sense. On a business level, these real-life action items provide great ideas to truly motivate my employees. I have to believe that if company leaders would truly embrace these principles they would not only enjoy more passionate employees but they'd also enjoy the bottom line impact. On the personal side, I also appreciate the hints that translate into being a better husband and dad."
__label__1,"This must be a generic version...: Usually the price of the replacement brushes are much more expensive at the store. This deal (on-line) was too good to be true. I'm already on my second brush head within one week. The small hole below the brush head pinches my lip everytime it makes contact with it and the attachement doesn't stay connected to the toothbrush. Furthermore, the first brush head that I used only last around 4 days. It literally broke up into little pieces in my mouth. Buy them at the store..."

__label__2,"good but a little noisy: Great airflow, good size. fits in the window nicely (horizontal or vertical). I guess I was expecting a little more quiet operations. It is not bad (I sleep with the fan on) but louder than I expected."
__label__2,"Laughed & Cried: An eye opening video that has affected what i eat and where I buy it from. I have definitely gotten aware of where farmers markets are and where they products come from. I avoid large grocery chains as much as possible, and I count my vote as important. Even if it is only 3 times a day.A great film. A must film for everyone."
__label__1,"Bad. I mean REALLY bad.: I have been a fan ever since the first movie came out. The franchise has definitely had its ups and downs over the years. This is not only a bad Highlander movie, it is one of the worst movies ever made. I found it to be as close to unwatchable as a movie could possibly be.The only reason I gave it one star is because ecom does not allow zero star reviews. This movie deserves the introduction of negative stars for reviews."
__label__1,"Great story but hideously annoying style!: I've never read a book that made me more conscious of the author. The plot was creative and intricate, the setting was fascinating and well described, and the characters were well developed, but oh, the prose! The style felt needlessly pretentious and overwrought, and I found myself becoming so annoyed with the author's intrusion into the story that I could only read it in small doses. I found myself mentally begging the author to get out of the way. I debated whether to read the rest of the series, because I found this book to be quite fascinating, but I decided it wasn't worth the annoyance."
__label__1,"Tastes ok - but congeals quickly, and full of partially hydrogenated oil: This cocoa tastes ok as it is a nice blend of chocolate and coffee flavors. However, it congeals quickly (these clumps of stuff rise to the top while the cocoa cools - within 5-10 minutes). Additionally, on reading the ingredients list, one discovers that this cocoa has quite a bit of trans fat (partially hydrogenated soybean oil is the 5th ingredient). So, although I am a hot chocolate lover, and often add coffee to my hot cocoa, I would not buy this product again."
__label__1,Wild!!!: Not a happy customer. Looks much better in the picture. This looks like something I will let my 4yr old daughter play with. Normally I go for the real thing and pay the expensive price and be happy. The first and last time I will ever decide to take the cheap way out. The braclet looks like some plastic sliver balls thats on a plastic string with the clap waiting to break and any given moment..What I paid for just the shipping should have been the price for the braclet. Never again!!!
__label__1,"Illustrative implications?: Am I the only person who finds the illustrations troubling? Two blonde haired, blue eyed children apparently identifying fault in large nosed, dark haired people who are identified as ""thingumajigs"". Perhaps I am too sensitive, but I am reminded of German political cartoons from the 1930s. In a world of multi-racial, PC childrens' books, I found the contrast striking without any implications regarding editorial intent."
__label__1,"Good untill the ending: Good story, with good twists... until the completely awful, unrealistic, STUPID ending. Its actually annoying to have wasted so much time to come to such a completely fabricated and totally contrived finale. Its so utterly dumb."
__label__1,"Simply Awful: I was so excited to find this set of DVD's on ecom - I'm raising my child bilingual and wanted her to be introduced to these stories in spanish. However, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The picture quality is the worst that I have seen in a DVD. However what made it such an unacceptable DVD was the audio. The words overlapped each other - it made it impossible to understand. Don't waste your money!"
__label__2,"love it: this is the best movie ever, love it so much I plan to buy several more. price was a little high"
__label__1,"A very expensive book, but the quality is not so good: The main advantage of this book are the examples: very well described and with wonderful pictures; but it is my opinion that the ideas and principles of statics are not well explained and the student, after reading this book is quite confused. So I recommend to do not buy this book if you need clear and good explanation of the theory."
__label__2,Panasonic SD-YD250: I bought this breadmaker new for the low price and am pleased with it. The only option that I miss is a delay timer.
__label__1,Privatopia: The book was at times cumbersome and confusing. It deserves credit for being one of the first books written that discusses industry but it appeared to support industry rather than owners of property. I found it lacking in useful information for homeowners and lacking in information that consumers could readily use.
__label__2,"Incredibly Addictive Reading: After reading for the first 100 pages and no murder having occurred, I was wondering if I was reading Agatha Christie or not. Alas, you can relax, a murder was to occur eventually. Having just read Murder on the Orient Express just prior to Death on the Nile, I found the two strikingly similar when juxtaposed together: both involve murders on a boxcar traveling with an eclectic, if not bizarre, group of travelers...and of course the intrepid Hercule Poirot to solve the mystery and make the world right. Good stuff.""But thank God, there is happiness in the world.""- Mrs. Allerton at the finale"
__label__1,Melted in the dishwasher: I love the older version of this cup that doesn't change color but could not find it in store so I got this one. First wash on the top rack of the dishwasher and it melted. A very poorly manufactured product.
__label__1,"Just awful: I don't think I could have imagined a worse Mr. Darcy. David Rintoul just doesn't fit the part - he just has no sex appeal at all. And his delivery is waaay off! He reminded more of Boris Karloff. This version was a big disappointment. There was no sexual tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the comedy between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett was lost as well. Elizabeth Bennett was played well, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Those who want a good representation of the book should try the 1995 version with Colin Firth. Ahh, now there's some major sex appeal!!!"
__label__1,"Don't order it: I have tried so many times to get this thing to work and I'm so dissapointed because I was really excited about getting it for my son as he has had other cds that work perfectly. And as others have had the same problem, I recommend not waisting money on that product"
__label__2,Beautiful: There is nothing like the live performance. Maybe that is why only 4 stars.Great technique with that indescribable quality that makes great athletes and great dancers...Super!
__label__2,"An excellent background to the reign: It was a well written summary of the age, and the monarch, which I enjoyed thoroughly. His knowledge is admirable and I was fascinated to discover that Henry was a much wilier bird than I had realised. An excellent background to the reign, which is a period of history in which I have long been interested. It explains the Reformation and the break from Rome in detail, and how popular Henry was for most of his reign; making money, and living in peace, took precedence over the Pope and even if Henry's motives were rather more personal his subjects nevertheless supported him."
__label__2,It kicks in underwater: Ok so when you first put them on it sounds like your in a tunnel. When you go underwater the bass kicks in and it actually sounds GREAT. HOWEVER you can't (at least I couldn't) go to deep cause my ears plugged up. if your swimming on the surface and under water they are great. If you don't mind your ears plugging up then by all means don;t pass it up due to that fact. To bad this product doesn't come with a air tank cause once your underwater your going to want to stay there. so in closing totally buy!
__label__1,"Great Concept; if you have duct tape: Ever since my dog ripped out my sliding screen door I have been looking for an easy replacement. This seemed to be it, for a while. I liked the screen but the fastening system uses velcro strips with adhesive on the back to stick to the door jamb. I thought the velcro wouldn't stick to my door but it was the other way around, the velcro didn't stay on the screen. The glue holding the screen to the velcro did not hold and left me with both halves of the velcro stuck to my opening and the screen on the ground. Now I did say it was a great concept, maybe I just had one with a bad batch of velcro. One other good thing, my dogs could run thru it."
__label__1,"a bit dinky: I wanted a case which didn't involve either velcro or animal skin, so this seemed like a good option. however, it's very difficult to open the first week or so of use, after which it starts to loosen up to the point that it opens when you don't want it to. it's thin and light, yes-but be careful; it's so thin that I actually nearly cut myself on the edges a couple times. I'm seriously thinking of taking mine back and shelling out the extra [money] for the palm brand one."
__label__1,"used book received with a used-used edition: I ordered the book ""management techniques for librairans"", 1983 edition-- according to the web ad. But when I received it, I was EXTREAMLY dissapointed because the seller sent me a 1976 edition. The Table of Content, as well as the content of the whole book, is totally not identical with the 1983 edition. (I happen to have a (1983 ed.)copy checked out from UC Davis library, so I can compare it right after I opened the package). My first experience buying used book is VERY unpleasant. Unless I can get refund from the seller, Laura and Dwayne Pearen, I don't think I will buy used books again--Just to avoid the hassel."
__label__2,"Very Interesting, but neat!: Ok, I don't know why I found this book intruiging! It took me awhile to read it, because it didnt started out slow. Then it gets moving! And thats why I give it 4 stars! Good book! Wonderful author! RECCOMEND... especially to anyone that wants to be a brain surgeon! This book is about how they would dig for skulls, so the DR. could help in his work. They got some famous skulls too!"

I use 8 scoops a day mixed with 2 cups milk and or water in blender.

Wow what a deal. Last time I complained about the NYT to NYT, I got an email back stating that they didn't set the price, but in clear font on the ecom NYT listing, it states that the NYT set the price. Bunch on liars."
__label__1,"A tired plot, a thoroughly unlikable heroine: Sandra Brown is a favorite author--I always buy her books as soon as they are released. I wish I had waited on this one. The plot is old and tired (A criminal fixates on a juror at his trial--haven't they made a movie or two with this plot line?), the heroine is unlikable and unbelievable and I am sick to death of maverick cops. Can someone write a book where the hero isn't a tortured loner? Ms. Brown is far more talented than this book. Take a pass, borrow it from a friend or the library if you must, but save your money for her next book. I'm sure it will be better."
__label__1,Do it yourself lie!: I purchased this product on the assumption that it was a do-it-yourself product but there is nothing do-it-yourself about it. You have to pay for the lab test to be done and pay for the postage to the USA. Not much good to me in new Zealand - I should have just paid for the test to be carried out in a lab here in the first place!!

__label__2,"The Giver - a book to remember: I think that ""The Giver"" was a very good book. It was well written and had a good meaning. In this book, Jonas shows a lot of courage and determination. He does not leave just for himself and Gabe; he leaves for the whole community.Some examples of courage were when he decided to leave the community. He had left his dwelling at night, taken a new child and had stolen food from the community. He knew that if he was caught, he would be condemed. That showed a lot of courage.He also showed determination by not giving up. He could have turned back any time and went back to the community, but he was determined. He knew what he had to do. 7.3AAM"
__label__1,Won't function: First I didn't receive this contacted the seller and they sent one out. I can't get this to open up it's a hassle to use. Not going to send it back though that's a hassle too. I'll just chalk up the loss of a couple of bucks.
__label__1,"TERRIBLE COAT RACK: This coat rack is terrible. 1st off they sent me the wrong color. They sent natural coffee color instead of the oak finish. 2nd off the coat rack fell over and all 3 feet broke off, spliting the wood so it was unrepairable. This item is cheaply made and did not even last a whole month before breaking. Trust me, do not waste your money."
__label__1,Broke down in 3 weeks: Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it. Sent it back to manufacturer (Garmin) who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over-nighted back to me. That was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet. Still waiting.

__label__1,Crow Lake: I was going to recommend this book to my book club and I am glad that I did not. I did not find this book to grab my attention.
__label__1,"Defective Item: Item exactly what I wanted. Then it leaked and the company would not replace. It's leaking more now and I try to fix it with clear duct tape but there's white rice looking seeds all over. Rating system is misrepresenttive. According to my caluculations, Nature Way deserves a 2.6 rating on 1-5 scale."
__label__1,"possibly the worst math book ever: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOKthis was the textbook for my first course in linear algebra and differential equations. i think there were about 350 students in the class and, i say about 90% students i talked to agreed: this book sucks. period. lack of solved problems. no practice questions. unhelpful.i don't mean soso-bad, i mean really really badyou can get much superior books for the this price"
__label__2,"XM car dock: The kit came with everything needed including a mile long antenna wire and a variety of mounting adapters (which I threw out and made my own from a small piece of .060 aluminum). I use the cassette adapter which works well. On the PRO side is that the unit is portable so I use the same radio/subscription in my office, at home, and in my wife's car. The only CON is that you need a fair amount of patience and creativity to neatly manage all three wires so they are mostly hidden. If you take your time to install the adapter where you can easily see the display and operate the controls, you will be very satisfied."
__label__2,"Big, Big saw: This is THE tool for cutting 4xs and 6"" Glu-lams. I was surprised at the smooth opperation of this saw on doug fir glu-lams and SYP 4x8s. The 32 tooth blade is the correct unit for very good cuts while framing. The only thing I do not like about this tool is the thumb safety button. Re-locating it to the forward handle would be a big help and ensure that the operator keeps both hands on the saw when starting it. I found myself using my left index finger to press the ""safety"" button to start each cut, therby removing my L hand from the saw. My right thumb is too large to work the [safety] button."
__label__1,"Tastes Like Old Nuts :(: Aw. I really wanted to like this raw fruit & nut bar because a raw food bar is such a great concept. But the bar tasted mainly like old nuts and vitamins. There aren't added vitamins in the ingredients, but that's still what I tasted. The fruits (dates and cherries) make the bar medium-sweet. But I certainly wouldn't guess that this was a cherry-flavored bar. I think this might be a better bar with a different combination of FRESH nuts (maybe minus walnuts, plus macadamias to add to the almonds and cashews in it) and with better quality fruit. I would have preferred a stronger cherry taste, but I really only got a faint figgy taste from it. I imagine I'll be steering clear of this brand in the future."
__label__2,"Compelling,Exhilarating,Hot: I kept hearing about this book, then I happened to see it featured on BET's Cita's World as ""Book of the Beek"". So I had to pick it up. Once I did I couldn't put it down!"
__label__1,"Vintage: This book disproves the adage that the old ones are always the best. I imagine that this might be useful for trite after dinner speakers, insomniacs, or anyone looking to write sitcoms that don't even make it to pilot.The funniest lines are those from celebrated comedians, and you will have heard them all before. The other so-called jokes would make your grandfather cringe.Truly awful."

My wife is a professional photographer, and we've taken thousands of photographs using various Canon 35mm SLR digital cameras, and Sandisks cards have always worked perfectly."
__label__2,Excellent!!: My pharmacist recommended this salt and it is simply the best. It tastes smooth and not bitter like regular table salt. I highly recommend this product.
__label__1,"They will break.: I have used these ear buds for a year with moderate use. I leave them in the case when storing, and never tweak the cable. In that year, I have lost all sound in the left ear bud and I hear loud static from time to time. Additionally, and beginning at the unboxing era of the bud's life cycle with me, the PTH battery door would not close and stay shut. Simply put, for the money I had invested I expected something with better build quality and longevity. The drivers are great, don't get me wrong, and I would highly recommend these for the light occasional listeber who needs something for airline flights or long car rides. These are not for the daily listiner or anyone expecting these to last a long time.I did contact Shur to take advantage of their warrenty. They required hard to find forms, my credit card and other personal information. Additionally, the service rep I had on the phone was incredibly vague and rude. I will not buy from Shur again."
__label__1,"Predictable an uninspired.: Enya needs a change, or shes gonna end up like the new-age version of Madonna. Her fans who follow her blindly, will always give her good reviews. But this cd is Enyas worst. Not one song on this CD remotely began to move me inside. The whole CD is luke-warm while trying to be overly sentimental. (reminding me of Madonna once again). I could try to find a soung to recommend for download, but i cant even do that.Enya is slowing slipping into the void where once good artists who fail to change end up. Madonna, Enigma... and now Enya."
__label__2,"Good advice for every day people: I'm a medical student and my loans for my medical education have skyrocketed and realized I need to plan a financially secure future NOW. In addition, I'm pursuing a master's degreee in business. In reading Mr. Tyson's book, I found lots of information that my business courses failed to explain or did explain but at a level way above my head. Like many other people, I would prefer an intimidating subject such as investing to be presented in clear, logical, plain and easily understandable English. Kudos to Eric Tyson for doing just that. I recommend this book especially for those with absolutely NO previous experience or knowledge in investing."
__label__2,"Luise Rainer Collection: These are three gems, especially ""The Emperor's Candlesticks"" which is a wonderful romantic period espionage movie. Beware though that the DVD itself seems to be a ""MOD"" which means it only plays on devices that only play DVDs (not on machines that copy)."
__label__1,"Good product with bad software: I purchased this printer for mainly 4x6 prints & my Canon printer for larger prints. The picture quality is often different from my PC monior screen and I have to adjust the graphic setting for different pictures. In other words, I have to waste several test prints before I finally get a picture close to the monitor. Also when I print, I need to individually import/transfer picture files into the Olympus software from My Pictures folder of Window XP. It cannot just click the picture and send it to the printer. What a pain! This product is OK if you print pictures directly from a camra and your expectation of photo quality is low. Once the color condition is met, the print itself is fantastic with waterproof paper."
__label__1,Highly overrated: This book does present some material well. But it is more of an advertising teaser so you'll buy the whole kaboodle paying several hundred dollars. Or worse you'll be motivated to take her course paying thousands of dollars.PMP exam prep has definitely been a growing industry. The certification is by itself overly hyped up. Sometimes it all seems like a scam. One can pass PMP by just reading a bunch of prep books. Just because someone is a PMP doesn't mean a squat.
__label__2,"Great inexpensive headphones: These are great classic ""cans"". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair ofblack cotton baby head bandsto wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal."
__label__1,"Worst movie ever: Snuff. Over in the UK this film was banned out right. Why?. Well the distributer tagged on a two minute sequence at the end of the film and sent the media wild by claiming that it was a real killing. Anybody who has seen this drivel will know that it is probably the most faked killing ever. The FX are rubbish and the ""victim"" is seen breathing after she is killed. The film was originally shot in 1974 in Argentina. It is so disjointed that it makes no sense. The director, Roberta Findlay, has no talent and I am sad to say it took me over three years to find a copy of this film. The gore fx in the film a amateurish which is only marginally better than the acting. The lead characters name is Sa Tan and he's the leader of a biker cult of women who look like they were rounded up from the nearest prison yard. This film is not worth a look."
__label__1,"If you can ignore the study notes, good Bible.: The study notes ruin this Bible for me. I bought it for my little sister and was shocked when I found the notes supporting Preterism of all things. Also, Sproul goes out of its way to promote Calvanism which isn't nearly as bad, but begs the question if we really need people promoting their theology, no matter what view they hold, in God's Word. There a quite a few times in this Bible where there is almost as much commentary as Bible on the page, and the commentary is pretty biased or even pretty cowardly. He doesn't even comment on Acts 7:51 and resisting the Holy Spirit ( the ""I"" in TULIP ).Just don't fall into the trap of depending on men to interpret the Bible for you. Meditate on God's Word and wait till He speaks to you through His Holy Spirit. Commentaries have their place, but it's not before the Spirit."
__label__2,"A Very Fantastic Movie, but......: I just got finished watching this movie. And to tell you the awesome to god truth, this movie is so phat. All the graphical unrealism, great stuntmen, great role-play, and the fighting shown throughout the whole movie. I really liked Wesley's attitude, he's cool, a ""cold-hearted"" hero. Those are the things people look for in a hero, or movie like this one. Only 1 drawback, it's that dog-gon lady that keeps on trailing behind Blade. I honestly got aggravated just by looking at her and hearing her talk. She wrecked the whole scene, but Wesley stole the mic and took over the stage. To me any one of you under 18, I don't think you should watch it."
__label__2,"Don't Pass This One Over: There are a lot of better known writers today. But, there are none better than Estelman.The Amos Walker series is fun, exciting and challenging. Strong characters and good stories. If you like noir mysteries and the Chandler hardboiled style, you'll love Estelman. This entry is one of his finest. But, whatever Estelman(Amos Walker) book you begin with, you cannot go wrong."
__label__1,"Good for young artists only. More serious artists left wanting more.: This book is good for young artists and young artists only. If you're a kid who just wants to enhance your doodling skills then buy this book! The markers it comes with are water based, cheap, and nothing like what the pros use. If you are over 13 or you are young but want to become a very serious artist do not buy this book! you should buy: How To Draw the Marvel Way by Stan Lee. That book is quite a bit more advanced and involved for drawing your favorite Marvel characters and for creating your own characters."

__label__2,"An Unbeliveable Story . . . that is True!: It captured me with the first page and I could hardly put it down.

__label__1,"I can't find the ""zero"" option for rating.: This book is completely awful. How many pages of pure garbage do you have to cut through to get to the main point? It doesn't matter, there is no point! For starters, this book is NOT a horror novel. It should be in the childrens section of the bookstore, next to ""Superfudge"" and other simplistic, shallow, 3rd grade reading levels! How about the three hundred times those stupid little freaks had to look at eachother ""with concern?"" Did you like that? PLEASE don't attempt to read this book."
__label__2,"Good4Gaming & All Other Basic Needs: Good quality on ventrillo, ingame, and on skype. Not adjustable, and the first few days or so your ears may feel a little sore after using them. After using it for 2 days it didn't bother me at all anymore. Bass feature requires batteries - I used it once and the bass was good, but I usually just use it with the feature turned off when I game. Had it for a month or so and it's still performing well."
__label__2,"Mr.Coffee ECM21 4-Shot Espresso and 8 - cup Coffeemaker Combo, Black: All in all a good maker for the price. The espresso maker is wonderful and easy to use. The coffeemaker is a different story. The reservior, that is plastic, needs to be cleaned many times until the coffee doesn't have that plastic taste, then when you pour the coffee pour slowly! The shape of the pourspot is not that shaped and the coffee just runs everywhere! But once all this is taken care of it's worth the price."

Really awful.....save your money and wait for it to come on cable if you're so inclined. I really would recommend skipping this movie entirely.DYB"
__label__1,"Not effective. Leaked: Seemed to dechlorinate, but also left the water a bit harsh, which dried out my skin and hair. My unit had a leak around the rubber o-ring that I was never able to locate. It would shoot a fine needle-like jet of water directly over the shower curtain and out onto the floor. I tried everything to get it to seal properly. Just a poor design."
__label__2,"Works with my application: I was worried that this product wouldn't work with my application, a home built analog to digital microcontroller.

__label__1,"I'll never buy another Hartz product.: I have a white cat. I applied the product per the directions. It turned his hair yellow-brown and looked so nasty. After a few hours, it still looked very wet and the color hadn't returned to white. I thought this was strange, so I started googling it. Then I found all the reviews on here about how bad it is. I have to agree. It was a waste of money, seems like a dangerous product, and now my kitty's hair looks nasty!"
__label__1,"Is a Book Really Worth It?: I read this book a while ago, and it doesn't seem that it offers anything earth-shattering.Sure, there will be the people who say that it changed their life. And there will also be the people who say that it's utter heresy.I ascribe to neither extreme. Hell, I'm not even in the continuum.Walsch may or may not be genuine when he says that he doesn't actually know if God inspired him to write this book. That does somewhat depend on his personal beliefs. However, whether he is genuine or not, you have to ask yourself if you will take the word of this man at face value.If I was in the position to purchase this book again, I wouldn't bother. It doesn't really offer much in the way of insight that I haven't already picked up from studying other moral traditions."

It's good fun for hardcore Tarzan fans. The only trouble I have with this serial, Is that chapter 4 is only 1/2 there, And chapters 5 and 6 are not anywhere on the tapes."

__label__2,"Great novel, Great writer: I read Wilson's second novel, Mannfred's Pain, and I was hooked since. Now his third novel proves he is a great contemporary writer. Any reader will notice his powerful prose unmistakably. This is an ambitious novel. It tries to encapsulate almost everything. Apart from satirizing Irish politics and the media, it also talks about love, parental and matrimonial, normal and deviate, friendship, capitalist absurdities and all the world absurdities in general. The unfolding of all the characters are charming. Even Jake's cat has vivid character.Jake's section is beautifully written, while Chuckie's is hilarious and nervous. This is one of a few novels that I don't want it to end."

__label__2,"Lil LOVES Lotty!: Santa brought our (then) 5 month old Lotty for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES Lotty! The antennae must be magical because that's the first thing she reached for and of course put in her mouth. Even when she's fussy, you can put Lotty on her tummy and give her kisses and she smiles and grabs the antennae and starts to play. She also likes to look at herself in the mirror on Lotty's tummy. I would definitely recommend Lotty to anyone looking for a lovable and entertaining toy."

__label__1,"Don't buy this flag kit: I received my flag as promised with in about 7 to 10 days. I opened it and was disappointed because I saw it was not exactly as described on line, it was cheap looking and when I tried to put it together the metal rods would not slide into each other very easy (one of the rods was bent). I tried to force it and it slipped and the sharp metal edge slashed two knuckles on my right hand. Looking at the cuts on my hand I knew the metal had done some serious damage to my middle knuckle I drove myself to the emergency room where I got 7 stiches. Since I just decided to go into business for myself I quit my job and lost my medical insurance and had to pay the 300.00 bill plus the bill for the cheap flag. I never received my free pinwheel that was promised as a free item with the purchase of my flag just an email 2 weeks after I got my flag stating the pinwheels were not available after all. If you buy the flag becareful they are dangerous if defective."
__label__2,Highly entertaining fiction: I read this book recently and could hardly put it down. The auther led me on a thrilling chase through several european countries and also through history. This book is great fun to read.I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of confusion among the readership over the historicity of key aspects of the book. Just keep in mind that this is a work of FICTION. No reputable biblical scholar believes that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married; or that the Holy Grail refers to Mary. This is pure imagination on the part of the author.Another reviewer on this site pointed out how Mr. Brown changed the floor plan of the Louvre to make the story better. The historicity of the book has similarly departed from the best scholarship.So--enjoy! Just don't confuse fantasy with reality.LRK

Imagine my disappointment when I get 24 minutes into the movie and I get double images! It lasted until about 32 minutes later (when Bob Hope encounters the Bucket of Blood). MGM needs to get the message that these classic movies simply can't be treated this way.Fortunately I still have my earlier DVD release thru HBO Films because I'll have to return this copy of the Princess and the Pirate.

They are good size, give the requisite chime upon clinking glasses and are very good-looking."
__label__2,"Great set: Everything worked out of box. I paid $4.50 for it, not it's more than 50% less, it's a steal! The reason for 4/5 stars is because the retractable cable doesn't retract well. Just a small gripe, everything else is great."

It also explores the often difficult job of making good foreign policy decisions in the face of seemingly unrelated, but nonetheless complicating, domestic politics. Lambert offers a work that should be viewed as important by historians and contemporary political scientists."
__label__2,"Rockin' Pop Explosion: The Bricks are coming at the nation w/ a mix of poppy ballads and upbeat rock. The mixture on SoapOpera shows the range of audiences that they can reach. With songs likes ""Preresquisite Rocker"" and ""Martyrs"", the Jellybricks show their rock-n-roll side. Switching it over to ballads like ""too far"" and ""bittersweet day"" shows that the guys--Bryce, Larry, Garrick, and Laine--are indeed flexible. Take the time and check out this release you won't be dissapointed. Just another good band from Central PA, who also happens to be a group of great, laid back, fun guys"

You can play from easy to impossible modes, select the size of the galaxy, number of AI opponents, choose your own custom race and attributes, design your ships and upgrade them for battle, and the path of scientific goals to make your race and ships better to conquer your opponents including the Antarans. I still play this to this day even though it is over 10 years old!Would recommend to anyone who like TBS type games."

__label__1,"Thanks for the tip: I was on page 34 when I decided to find out what ecom readers were saying about this book. After reading just five of the reviews, I have decided not to waste my time, which is really too bad, because I have been waiting several months for this book! Southern Cross was funny, but this book so far has been just plain stupid Windy Brees....give me a break!"
__label__1,"Starts great then...: There is something about British Jazz that seems to embrace the 'free' element and unfortunately Graham Collier is one of them. That is for every good moment the next is disjointed noise or 'free' soloing. For the listener this proves an endurance test and i had difficulty getting through the 55 minute suite.If only the opener 'hackney five' had been the benchmark for the rest, but it isn't. The first two movements have some excellant ensemble playing and Art Themen plays a great solo and after that it is all downhill. Solo's are played alone or mesh with each other and the opening theme gets buried in the molase. I'd suggest novices go for 'songs for my father' which is coherant and accesible, but this well its just dull."
__label__1,"PLEASE BELIEVE THE REVIEWS---AWFUL!: I read all the reviews before I bought this book, but I didn't believe it could be that bad. I wanted a view from ""the other"" side of this story--but instead I got a horrible waste of time. This guy (Shimomura) loves himself so much it makes for a nauseating and boring read. If you want to know about the Mitnick events, read Litman's book (Fugitive Game)--it's much better."

Through the main character's eyes, I revisited the land I loved so much as a child. However, this author makes many clever puns and plays on words so that this is very enjoyable for the adult reader.And after reading this book, I hope there are more on the way from this author.I would recommend this without any reservations. It is well written, has a clever plot with surprizing twists, and yet he ties it all together in the end. Five stars."

They didn't even bother to let me know they were out of inventory and seems like they weren't even going to bother to let me know. After I spoke to them, the guy said that they were back in stock and they would ship the remaining 6 of them. Three days later I get an email saying they are out of stock again. I contacted them and they said that they went out of stock that day I contacted them. I feel as if I was told that I would get my parts, that they would honor that and set the amount I needed aside since I've been waiting over a month for something that was originally in stock. Never ordering anything form them again. I waited a month and a half for something that should have came with the first shipment."

I never write reviews -- this book was so annoyingly poor that I was determined to say something. What happened to Elizabeth Lowell? Where's the author who wrote the other ""Always"" books or the ""Only"" series or the rest of her books?!! The premise was a good idea -- but I think she started to drown in all the characters that had to be brought in to make the premise work. And, one paragraph love scene, does not a Romance Novel make!! By the end of the book I couldn't have cared less about anyone of the characters -- I just wanted the book to be over! Do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback. The hardback was too expensive for the lack of pleasure you receive. Sorry Elizabeth, you're too talented a story teller to sell your public this lackluster excuse for a novel. I gave you two stars because you sat down and tried to write something!"
__label__2,Unicorns: I ordered the Beanie Baby Unicorns for my daughter's 6th birthday party as favors. Big hit! They were exactly what I expected and I received them very quickly.
__label__2,"I learned to subnet.: I learned to subnet using this book. Previously I was quite horrible in math and algebra, however this book teaches subnetting on a different approach. It was exactly what I needed. I must say that now that I have mastered subnetting, I have conquored my CCNA exam and on to bigger and better things. Thank you very much Keith Sutherland."
__label__2,Great Camera Bag: This bag is wonderful for my Canon 7D and lenses and accessories. It has plenty of room and lots of padding to protect your equipment. The straps on the side come in handy for carrying your tripod or straping your jacket to your bag if you get hot while shooting pics. The only complaint I have at all is that the top of the straps seem to be a bit too close together. Perhaps as I wear it more they will soften up an little and won't feel like they're pinching my shoulders. Overall a good bag and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a good backpack for their Canon.
__label__2,"Un son différent.: Brillante d'originalité, Camille nous donne sur ""le fil"" un nouveau son. Elle apporte un vent de fracheur dans une industrie essoufflée et minée par le recyclage. Cet album offre la plus belle combinaison de musique inspirée, de textes travaillés et de performance vocale surprenante qu'il m'ait été donné d'entendre depuis longtemps."
__label__2,"Best fantasy book I ever read!: This is a great book, about a life in the future. It has feeling and romance, the characters were so real. New technology and development in a new age. A awsome Fatasy book. I would recommand you to read it!"
__label__2,"Delightfully fun!: I am a baby boomer, and I purchased this tape for myself and my 7 yr old son. We fight over it! It is delightfully fun. We enjoyed all the songs!"
__label__1,"Overpriced ?: I would urge caution and price up the items individually - You will be able to save much money by buying them as seperates, even with the 50% off offer ! (Feb 2006)"
__label__2,"So far so good: I recieved these controllers for christmas. I have had the console they made for years, but never got the wireless controllers. I now have a projector and I can keep the console in the hall closed and geek out to my 8 bits again!"
__label__2,Nice and inexpensive: Nice looking inexpensive ring. No complaints. Better than spending a large amount on a ring that looks the same.
__label__1,"Soap: This book is about as close to a Soap Opera as you can getwithout video.The story is about twin brothers separated at birth and raisedby different families, and it follows their lives through aseries of coincidences that defies imagination. Even the authorreminds us that sometimes a rare coincidence does happen, buthe fails to convince us such a series of coincidences as heredescribed could actually happen.The story will appeal to a few, but there is no suspense, notension, no surprises, and one page reads like another. It isjust an on-going rather boring story, and people who actuallylived the lives fictionalized here couldn't possibly lead suchdull, predictable lives.There just isn't much here to engage any serious reader, andmost readers will want to avoid wasting their time with thisone."
__label__1,"Difficult at best: I bought this camera for my Mom, so she and I could talk on skype, and while it IS now working on her Dell, it took some serious troubleshooting. Not good for a non-computer person and me trying to troubleshoot it over the phone. Also this camera will not work on my Mac, so I can see her but she still can't see me! I tried everything I read on the Skype forums and I still can't get it to work on my Mac.If something is sold as plug-and-play... it should be plug-and-play, no? This one is not!"
__label__1,"Not great Quality: I bought this because it had a great vehicle charger housing.However, when I paired it with my Samsung Rogue, I found the quality of the earpiece to be less than desired.The signal strength was approximately 3 feet before it would dramatically fail. I would lose the contact with my phone via bluetooth and the sound quality would become scratchy and statically.The housing however, was handy and neat for my car. Too bad I didn't get a chance to use it."
__label__2,"BOSTON's triumphant comeback...: When an early version of the smash-hit Amanda by BOSTON and Tom Scholz leaked to radio-stations in the US during 1984 the word was out - THIRD STAGE - BOSTON's triumphant comeback from 1986. Kickin' off with Amanda followed by We're Ready, Cool The Engines, To Be A Man, I Think I Like It, Can'tcha Say and Hollyann. All of them excellent songs and as always the key to success is in the quality of the songs. THIRD STAGE has to this day sold several millions of copies around the world. Listen to it and you'll know why..."
__label__2,YOGA 101 WORKOUT / DAILY ROUTINES FOR BEGINNERS: Lilia has been around for decades. She used to be on PBS in Boston during the 60s when I was a little girl & I used to watch her. I'm very pleased with the program & she explains everything very clearly. I'm still on the 1st dvd. when I master this I'll move on to the next one. This is worth the money & it's reasonably priced. I'm looking forward to purchasing her other dvds.
__label__1,My PC doesn't let me see it :(: I don't hate it - can't even view it to see it. Should not have purchased the download version. I'll stick to purchasing dvd instead. I wish I could get a refund.
__label__1,"RITES heavy on Melodrama: Contrary to many, I found this film to be cloying and melodramatic. The plot and the writing often seem forced, and the performances occasionally border on the ridiculous. I found it to be a little hard to take seriously, but I know several viewers who found it to be utterly realistic. It is certainly gratifying to see an actor of Dean Stockwell's stature helping the genre of gay film to stretch its borders and its visibility, but this film was for me a mixed bag at best."
__label__2,"!: THIS IS THE FULLY DEVELOPED RUSH OF THEIR 'EARLY PERIOD'...AND I CONSIDER THIS CLASSIC OF AN EXCITING ALBUM 'EARLY RUSH' ALONG THE LINES OF CARRESS OF STEAL AND FLY BY NIGHT...THE BIG CHANGES WOULD COME WITH KINGS AND HEMISPHERES A LITTLE LATER ON WHERE ALEX'S GUITAR WOULD START SINGING IT'S OWN LITTLE CATCHY SONG PARTS WITHIN SONGS...THIS RUSH ALBUM HERE IS MEAN, FIERCE CAPTAIN BEYOND-LIKE PROG THAT EXPLODES WITH PASSION AND ANGER...LIKE ALL RUSH IT IS LOADED WITH AMBIANCE AND BRADY BUNCH LIKE MELODIES BUT PACKAGED TO EXPLODE LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB...GEDDY AND NEIL ROCK OUT COMPLICATED BUT ALEX IS MORE THAN HANGING ON FOR THE RIDE...THE SONGS DO GET MELLOW AFTER A WHILE BUT THATS OK...RUSH WERE 'FINDING THEIR WAY'....A FIVE STAR CLASSIC EPIC !

__label__1,"Be very careful!!!: As an experienced MCT, and having taught from the MOC courseware, I can say that this book has some of the worst labs I've ever had the inopportunity to use. Especially the REGEDIT labs, where they had you looking for keys that didn't exist! (HKEY_LOCAL_COMPUTER?!? Come on!) There are a lot of end of chapter test questions that are answered in the Instructors Resource CD that are just plain wrong. Sometimes, there will be 21 answers given, but only be 20 questions in the text book! Also, the cover ripped off my copy in the first week I had it. So, use caution when using/teaching from this book. If the web site had a errata that was easy to locate, then I may be more forgiving, but it doesn't so I'm not!"
__label__1,"Not worth the price: I wanted protection for my iPod for when I throw it in my purse. This case looks ok. It feels like rubber though, not very pleasant. Also, this product claims to to thin enough that you can still plug it your iPod in other products (speakers, radio connection, etc), but it's just not true. This case is not THAT thin and your iPod won't fit unless you remove the case. Plus, the case is really hard to put on/take off, so that's not an option. The screen protector is just this thin piece of plastic that doesn't stick or stay on the screen, it won't protect your screen at all."
__label__1,"Terrible: I received wrong item and I returned it with my money,but I received ridiculous email from seller. They are impolite,"
__label__2,"This is a good one!: After Memnoch The Devil (yawn) and The Vampire Armand left me cold and disappointed, I really enjoyed Blackwood Farm. This novel made me excited about Anne Rice again for the first time since Queen of the Damned.The characters are believable and Lestat seems more like himself.If you had given up on Anne Rice but miss her terribly, give this one a read."
__label__2,"This is the real deal...: Born in Arizona I grew up eating ""real"" Mexican food which I sorely missed when I moved to a nearby western state. One day I found this small inexpensive cookbook in a local bookstore. I bought it. I've never been disappointed with the purchase. You will find real southwestern-style Mexican home cooking. Not your fancy ""gourmet"" recipes found in pricey wannabe Mexican cookbooks but the real deal.The recipes are tasty, use normal pantry ingredients. Purchase this cookbook for some fine Mexican home cooking!"
__label__1,"Read the book, it is much better.: I bought this DVD to use as a comparison for the book by the same title. As a stand alone it probably would be a good film, but compared to the original book by the same title - it was awful. So much of the story lines were changed and some of the film was chopped up that it didn't make sense from the book."
__label__2,Serenity Relfections: Excellent short read and explanation on the various stanzas of this very popular prayer.
__label__2,Hot like Fire: This book keeps you wanting more! I was not able to out it down until I finished every single page! Keep up the great work!
__label__1,"Depressing, even disturbing.: Z for Zachariah is a depressing novel, even a disturbing one. Ann is forced into a life of solitude by circumstances. Even when the man, Mr. Loomis, entered the valley, she received little companionship, just pain and suffering for the most part. One interpretation might be that Mr. Loomis forced her out of the valley so she would seek others and procreate her species because he believed there were others after seeing the birds. But even with the protagonist professing hope at the end, there is no guarantee of finding other life. Even an optomistic reader must agree that hardship is certain and survival uncertain.The title Z for Zachariah would not indicate hope if it refers to her Bible alphabet and her belief that Z for Zachariah stood for the last man."
__label__2,High Quality Nut Driver Set: This set was bought as a gift. It was perfect. The recipient had used this product at work so he knew the quality. Highly recommended! Excellent product.
__label__1,"NOT heavy duty, broke the first time I used it.: I had misgivings as soon as I removed this flashlight from it's packaging. It has a thin gauge aluminum case that could easily be dented or torn. When I first powered up this flashlight, I was impressed by the diffused bright light. It lit up close by objects, but offered no illumination for objects more than 10 feet away.My biggest complaint is the reliability. I dropped it once. It stopped working. I am pretty handy with my hands, but I was unable to get the flashlight to light up again."
__label__1,"Surely you're BORING, Mr. Feynman !: There's no fun, no interesting ideas, no physics, no jokes ....actually when I come to think about it - there's nothing in this book.Feynamn must have been a great mind in physics (you can't tell from this book) and he must have been a very charming person - or so they say, cause you can't tell from this book either. I find him boring, self-centered, obnoxious and someone that will be nice to persons with an IQ exceeding 200, and ONLY if they are into Nobel prize level of physics...To regular folks he was a nasty, egoist, allegedly funny guy. If you want to read a whole book about his pranks, go ahead and good luck.Don't be fooled by the title like so many others."
__label__2,"Good! Almost Great!: Loved this book! Went out and bought the other three as well! I really like the character Maisie Dobbs and I love her method of working, using psychology along with deduction and extensive footwork. I like her competence and I get the feeling that there her character and her career are going to escalate in future books. I'm looking forward to it!"
__label__1,"Horrible: Eminem and Vanilla Ice are the highlights of this poorly made film. If you purchase the dvd (I urge you not to) prepare to be disappointed. The movie has a very weak story-line, is mostly incoherent, and a waste of money."
__label__1,"Anti-Arab, Anti-Islam Propaganda: Don't look for actual documentary information in this video. Produced by JerusalemOnlineU.com, a diploma mill exposed by Forward magazine ([...])and directed by South African Wayne Kopping, who also did such objective ""documentaries"" as Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West; Crossing the Line: The Intifada Comes to Campus; and The Third Jihad.This video is Israeli hasbara (propaganda). A 55-min. infomercial. Avoid."
__label__1,"Getting too old...: As another reviewer said, it's more for kids aged 12-15 or 16. I'm now 18 years old and am just finishing up a 2 year subscription to Seventeen. It's got too many ads, pointless quizzes, and their sex advice columns aren't really what I'm looking for anymore.I have switched over to Marie Claire and I love it! It's totally made for the 18-20somethings crowd. It's an amazing magazine that is worth the $$$. Check it out sometime. You won't be disappointed!"
__label__1,"I wanted to love this movie: I just got around to watching this movie on DVD. I'm a fan of romantic comedies and an even bigger fan of James Marsden. Katherine Heigl was very good but I just didn't connect with her character. I just found it odd that everyone was supposed to know that Jane was in love with her boss but her own sister DIDN'T KNOW??? I didn't like Jane's best friend either. The way Jane almost killed them in the car accident didn't seem to forsee a romantic hook-up. The only saving grace of the bar scene was having Marsden sing a few bars. Marsden has a great voice and I loved him in Hairspray. Overall, a so-so movie at best. The performances save this from being a total bomb."
__label__1,"STINKY!: In the past, I rated a diaper pail that required expensive refills. In the review I stated to go for a pail where you can use your own bags...that's what had done. All was well for a couple of months. Our diaper changing area was on the first floor in the laundry room. We put a changing pad on top of the dryer so we wouldn't have to run upstairs all the time to change diapers (we had 2 children in diapers at the same time)...well soon we started to notice an odor and it didn't go away. We came to realize that the pail itself was absorbing the odors and we could not get rid of the stench no matter how much we washed it. Now we just use an ittby bitty garbage can that holds about 5 diapers and we empty it out every day...that's the only way to keep the diaper smell out of the house."
__label__2,"Great book for cancer survivors: Fran is honest and forthright in revealing her innermost feelings and struggle. I wasnt sure I could relate since she is a ""celeb"" but the cancer is a leveling situation."
__label__1,"Interesting, but impractical.: Buy this book if you are a jaded knitter and need the inspiration to take your craft to strange places where few knitters have gone before. Think Jan Messant - she of the atfully knitted vegetables (interesting, but who needs them) - only ten times so.For the rest of us, this one is interesting but impractical. You would never make any of the designs but it's still interesting to look and ponder at them. Think of it as a book on knitting theory, or a book of upscale gourmet recipes with beautiful pictures, rather than the recipe book that you love and use everyday."
__label__1,"Oh the lies!!!!!!: These are not 18/10. They are marked on the back of the handles as 18/8. But even this is very suspect. 18/10 stainless will barely hold a strong magnet, and 18/8 is slightly magnetic. This is how the forks are. The spoons however are made of two different metals; the handles are not magnetic, but the bowls of the spoons are highly magnetic - so the part most exposed to corrosion is likely 18/0. The butter knives handles and and blade are highly magnetic. They are likely entirely 18/0.Also the bowl of the teaspoons is deep and less comfortable to me than most teaspoons - but this is probably just a personal thing. I prefer smaller forks and spoons.""Always a child, and never a man, poor Mr. Plum"""
__label__2,"Neiko Solderless Wire Terminal: The connections and everything are great, just the pieces I needed, however the provided wire strippers are really a pain. I'd suggest getting a better primary pair and keep these as back up."
__label__2,"Three in One!: A combination of The Blair Witch Project, The Exorcist, and Rosemary's Baby, all in one movie!Being an independent movie with unknown actors, adds more to an authentic feeling of realism.Not at all what I expected - Very original.I LOVE the Ending!"
__label__1,"Not for ski trip: I got them mostly for being very light and small. In the city it worked up to 1/5 of a mile, you can connect a bit more but hear only static. On a ski resort it only worked within the same building/lodge; you cannot connect to another radio even on the same side of the mountain. I'd return them, but as they are so small and sleek, we lost one on the second day."
__label__1,"Why Are People So Stupid?: This moronic cd has been number 1 for three weeks in the USA (of course most copies end up in the used bin after people hear how crappy it is). The buzz is out- the backlash is starting....Em's days are numbered. Anyway, being that most of the musically immature people who listen to this debased trash grew up on MTV, daytime talk shows and bad sitcoms it should be no surprise that this kind of juvenile ""rebel without a brain"" noise is popular with the ignorant masses. Em knows his audience is stupid and lost and many will praise anything he releases because they have no life of their own and think that success means being a ""star"" who sleeps with ""hoes"" and touts a ""glock"" and promotes selfishness....oh and YES I did listen to this cd a couple times out of curiosity...it is shameless....sure, Em is laughing all the way to the bank as all these fanatics follow him into oblivion."

__label__1,Don't waste your money: This aspirator is a complete waste of money -- it doesn't work at all. It comes apart when you try to squeeze it and you don't get any suction from it.
__label__2,"Kickus assus maximus: Whoah..... I have to admit this is the first digital camera i've ever owned.... It's quite large and heavy, but it has a really great lens and the standard settings are great for starters... The quality of the photo's is superb.I own a few ""normal"" camera's and i'm not a pro in making photo's. I use both my regular APS and my digital camera when I'm out to take pictures. The big advantage of a digital camera is the direct look and (usually) delete option. This one looks like a camera and not like a discman or mp3player. A camera is made to make photo's and not to look cool in your pocket... The lens is one of the best there is... And it's really user friendly!The big disadvantage is the battery life... it uses 4 aa batteries. ....Despite this little disadvantage it's a 5 star rating in my book!"
__label__2,"Great for locking up stuff: My wife is an ex-drug user so we use this to keep pills in. The keys stay hidden, and the five digit combination is more than sufficient. I don't know what anybody else wants locked up, but the great thing about this safe is that you can leave it in plain sight and easily access it without having to dig up a key. Performance of the keypad is flawless, and the led fades when the battery runs low and needs replacing. This indication is especially useful because we use the safe every day"
__label__1,"Sooo dissapointed: I got this book because it had such awesome reviews. I'm going to be taking a test in the near future, and you're allowed to use a medical dictionary, and I picked this one.I've been taking practice tests. On the first practice test I took, the first 6 out of 7 medical terms I tried to look up weren't in the book. I was stunned, and several of them were pretty basic words that I just wanted to get a very clear definition of.I'm not sure it's even going to be worth lugging this book to the test, or even keeping the book. I may just sell it and try another book.Jane"
__label__1,"Nine Lives: Boring..boring..boring..What an absolute waste of money. I read the synopsis of the movie and it looked interesting. I purchased it and realized that I had truly wasted my money. Nothing original and interesting, just stories, which by themselves were not interesting, with some flashes of simulated sex, which wasn't interesting either, thrown in for no reason. This movie is a dud."

__label__2,Can't beat it for the price: Great little computer for the price. I tested this against a GPS sport watch and the distance was spot on. It isn't completely intuitive to use so I find myself looking at the instructions more than I like but the learning curve should be short. I'm sure if you are a super serious biker then this probably wouldn't have everything you want but it is more than adequate for a novice like me. The size of my wheel wasn't listed in the chart so I had to do some calculations to come up with the correct diameter but that is easy enough. I bought two of these computers so that I could have one on my bike and on my husbands. It took some effort to get the magnets and sensor set correctly on the first bike but the second was simple. I highly recommend this product!
__label__2,"Phone Works Well: I bought this phone primarily for the speaker feature, which works very well. In addition, I find all the other features easy to use and easy to read."
__label__2,"Some nice surprises: A few nice things that aren't mentioned in the product description or other reviews: these monitors have two inputs which are summed internally, great for those of us who want to connect these to our audio interface AND the output from our computer. Also, the 1/4"" connection can be a balanced one if using tip ring sleeve cables.Sure you can get better monitors, but if you've damaged your hearing by cranking up that guitar amp too many times, you probably can't hear the difference. So save some money.One other thing that's just my personal sense of things is that I don't think these monitors are quite as flat as people say. At very high and very low levels, I think the bass response is weaker than the mid-high frequencies, about 2.5 to 5k. It's always a good idea to listen to your mix at different volumes, anyway, so you might notice it too."
__label__1,"Poor explanations, poor book: This book explains the absolute bare minimum on how to do the problems. Every problem in a set is a curve-ball type, and with only the odd answers, you never feel like you get enough practice, other than re-doing each problem.(side note)The solutions manual is absolute garbage, the explanations dwell on the most obvious points, then gloss over things that actually need explanations.Unless you really know this stuff, you will need outside help. It's one of ""those"" manuals where it tells you the answer and how to start problems, but every solution will have you scratching your head thinking ""how did they get from here to there?""Only the odd problems are solved, so you're better off with just the crappy book, and hope you have a really good instructor."
__label__2,"Awesome!: Thank you so much for the great service - I actually had the original album years ago or maybe it was a cassette - lol, anyway one of those ""antiques"" & I loved it but I lost it - I'm so glad she's on CD now - I Love Carly & this CD - thanks again for the quick service!

__label__1,"pass on this one, too many misses, not enough hits: I love 99.99% of Mariah's music. Her rap selections I do not care for. It is too bad the songs I really, really love, are mixed with those I really dislike. If rap is not your choice, leave this one on the shelf."
__label__1,"An amateurish account: This book was a disappointment. I ...was very interested. I am a 'fan' of Marie Antoinette and have been fascinated with her life since reading Castelot's biography of her.This book however, though it has some interesting pamphlets of historical interest, is more like a scrapbook. The writing is poor and has no direction. The pamphlets reproduced in the book are mostly pornographic lyrics and droll poetry of the Queen. The worst of which is Marie Antoinette riding an erected penis as if it were an ostrich.If you want to learn about the Queen, her children, or the French Revolution, this is not the book to find it in. If you are very familiar with the Queen's life, this may offer you a little insight as to the people's attitude at the time, but that's it. I read it once, and it has been on the shelf since.For a truly amazing book about Marie Antoinette, I suggest 'The Fatal Friendship'."
__label__1,Almost Useless: The hearing aids I currently use are heavy on batteries. The ICell Tech batteries last from 15 minuets to a day and a half. Most of them have lasted about 10 hours. Will never buy these batteries again. Costco batteries last me about 2 days. I sent my aids in for recalibration and was informed this is the nature of my current aids.The company I bought the batteries from were OK . Prompt with the shipping and well packed
__label__1,"Why can't I give no stars?: I have been an electronic nut for years and my mom and dad wanted to purchase me a reliable DVD recorder. I got this one. I am now so afraid of DVD recorders that I won't buy another one. This one worked for exactly 10 recordings. Now nothing. Zilch. Zero. I can't even play the discs that it recorded on it. I can still play commercially produced DVDs and the Dolby Digital is awesome on my surround sound system (Harmon Kardon receiver and Klipsch speakers), but I can't do anything else. I took this to the repair shop three times and they claim that nothing is wrong. I call Sharp and they tell me to try slower recordable speed discs. I even tried to change disc brands, nothing works. I really want a DVD recorder, but if this is how all of them act, then I will stick with VHS for the moment."
__label__2,"Much better than its predecessor: I picked this up in a cleaning-up-loose-ends binge; I had read the predecessor, Crown Duel, and read this one to finish the ""duet"" of books. I found it to be far better than Crown Duel. As opposed to the battle and war focus of the first one, this focused on the more human political plots and controversies occuring at court. I found it a lot more interesting and better written. This one contained mystery and controversy, had a deeper and more layered plot and yet still maintained very strong ties to the first book. It was an excellent follow-up to a not-so-excellent first book."
__label__1,"handles like a bull dozer: bought this to use with my Graco 35 car seat, after many reccomendations from friends. car seat snaps in easy enough, but the stroller frame is a pain in the neck to open and to close - super awkward twist handle and lock thingy. it really doesn't fold up all that small - there are plenty of strollers that are way more compact. i could deal with all of this, but the handling is the killer - it's such a tank. bad engineering,"
__label__2,"depressing, fulfilling, and enraging.: This book is very sad in some parts, because June (the main character) feels out on her own sometimes and, well, like she's walking on air. Even though it is kind of depressing, it's a real page turner, and there are lots of twists in the story. Sometimes I got really furious at June's dad for being so intollerant of other religions. He won't even let June read a book of fairy tales because he thinks it's paganism! I find that very ignorant of him. This is a very fun book to read, and I recommend it."

__label__2,"Revivogen Shampoo & Conditioner - Good Product: I've been using this product for 1 month now and I really like the results that I'm getting. Prior to using this product my hair felt thin and frail. It doesn't ""re-grow"" hair and don't expect any miracles, but it will leave your scalp feeling very healthy and clean and the remaining hair that you do have will feel more full and I believe it has slowed down the amount of hair I lose naturally on a day to day basis. Great product and I'll continue to purchase."

A standard Melita drip filter yields a cup of coffee that is indistiguishable from the Aerobie AeroPress.The only small advantage for the AeroPress is that it is able to produce a single cup of coffee a bit quicker than a drip pot - but only a single cup, not a mug!Save your money and buy some high quality coffee instead of this product and use your old drip pot."

__label__1,"This is Definitely NOT APP: If you were an Alan Parsons Project fan back in the 70's and 80's, the only thing you will NOT find in this 2 cd set is the original APP music.I bought this set today from a shopping mall and could hardly wait until i go to my car and put the cd in the car stereo.First track is ""I Robot"" (enstrumental), its so changed that i couldnt even recognize it.90% of the songs are NOT the originals i used to love back in the 70's.This is CHEAP ELEVATOR MUSIC. This can be anything but definately not Alan Parsons.I feel so cheated that first thing in the morning i will be returning it. And i will never buy a new APP cd again.Shame on you APP.I guess other reviewers either only wrote their comments by looking at the track listing or they are so young that they dont know the original APP music.If you love APP dont buy this set."
__label__1,"stop directing: Another bad one from the worst director, I wish I could give it 0 star. I might don't have rights to review it because I couldn't finish it, it is too bad. I don't undertand for what reasons, he want to damage this famous chinese history story. If the Jinke ( the hero ) still alive, he probably will assassin him.In china, audience laugh at this director: he did better as an actor in this film."
__label__1,"Not as good as book 1: I read book 1 and decided when I finished it to immeditaley buy book 2, but to be honest book 2 was quite a deception. No paranormal stuff in this one, I got really annoyed by the tone of the Duke and there were quite some editing errors (incorrect sentences, letters of words misisng) plus Aunt Dimity was playing a very, very, very small part in this book.Still hesitating if I should continue with the series. Good for a beach holiday, but that's about it."

It's important to note that this is way better! Hint hint.... these are the people who should have been on the cover of Spin Magazine. Good luck, guys!"
__label__2,"John Mayer is a good artist: I own this CD and personally I like it better than Heavier Things. His three best songs ""No Such Thing"", ""Why Georgia"" and ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" are all my favorite. I wanted this CD because I heard Your Body is a Wonderland on the radio a million times and No Such Thing and I liked it. I'd give this CD 4.5 stars. John Mayer is one of my favorite artists. And the songs are really good. But it's just my opinion."
__label__1,"Dragged into Darkness: I could not continue reading this book after the first chapter. It was not at all what I thought it would be and I lost interest almost immediately. From the cover I thought I would like it but it said nothing about vampires, etc. and skipped at first anyway from one thought to another. I would probably not buy or read another one of his books as I felt the writeup on this was very misleading."
__label__2,"TOP NOTCH WRITING AND PREMISE WILL HAVE YOU ENTHRALLED: Ritual of Proof was the best book I've read in three years. From the characterizations to the plot to the sumptuous descriptions, rop is an unforgettable tale. Certainly a must for anyone who loves to see a writer stretch her writing boundaries and the boundaries of genre fiction. Once started, it is impossible to set aside. After it is finished you will think a long time about these people and the world they live in. A huge thumbs up from me! This is one of the few books I've added to my most reccomended list. I loved it!"
__label__2,"Wow: And I thought ""Midnight Express"" tore me up.This is a must-see. You will be pretty fried when it's all over, but it's well worth the emotional journey.Highly recommended."

__label__2,"Excellent, phenomenal concert from Mary J!: Mary J Blige's concert from Los Angeles came out so beautifully on the DVD! She sounds superb vocally after more than a decade in music. She smartly does a medley of her past hits before moving to the central part of the concert. She has visual parts in the show with the dancers acting out the lyrics she sings. Children of the Ghetto is so very well done by her. And songs like My Life, Not Gon' Cry, No More Drama, Family Affair, You Don't Have To Worry, Love At First Sight and many others sound quite good live. Her band and singers sound superb all throughout! Had a lot of the crowd on its feet during most of the songs. Mary does a fine job talking to the crowd about her life, her past experiences, her struggles, her fighting back and other aspects between the songs. It makes the show livelier too."
__label__1,Sergei Rachmaninoff: Greatest Hits: The cover is misleading. It lists the 2nd piano concerto but the CD only has a small part of the concerto on it.
__label__2,"beautiful: This is slow beautiful music. NOT ambient and NOT new age and NOT sappy (in my opinion), just simply beautiful. Think Mogwai, Lanterna, or Dif Juz, but better. There are low volume vocals, but mostly instrumental. Some of the most perfect peaceful music. The song ""The Sort of Juice I'm Used To"" is by far the best. Don't let the interesting song titles fool you, this is a must have."

__label__1,"Very disappointed: I was very disappointed with the hummingbird house. It looked nothing like the photo. No ""roof"" and fake plastic branches that arrived broken due to being shoved into too small a box. I purchased this item as a gift and was very embarrassed when it was opened. It looked like a Dollar Store purchase."
__label__1,"Good to search materials, but bad to learn from Ganong: I am a medical student. I bought Ganong 18th edition last year. I found it full of new materials but everything it said was not detailed enough to make me understand. If you are a freshman to the subject physiology,I recommand you not to use Ganong as your first book. You must read other books written in detail,like Guyton's Physiology first. A more detailed book would make you easy to understand the beauty of physiology."
__label__2,"Stories of courage and spiritual insight: Katherine Martin's Women Of Spirit gathers stories of courage and spiritual insight from the women who lived unusual lives. Stories of spiritual guidance and how these women made a different in their worlds prove inspiration and absorbing, with the book providing sections based on the type of spirit exhibited by each."
__label__2,"A great reference after you've taken the course: This was the required book for my college's power electronics course. Like a lot of college books, it's hard to understand without any help from a professor or other students. However, once you've taken the course this book becomes a very useful reference. It is well-organized and contains a lot of information. When I need a refresher on switching power supplies I'm going to look at this book first."
__label__2,"money saver: A replacement filter is no longer available for my fridge, so I have been purchasing the 2.5 gallon jugs of spring water, which usually would last a week. My sister told me about this Pur dispenser. I have been using it for a month now and love it. In another month, it will pay for itself. I now use filtered water to make tea, gatorade, and coffee.

My daughter (age 9) will play the CD ""just to hear it"", and her recognition of classical tunes and composers is truly amazing. It's about time we had a product like this on the market. I can't wait for Volume II!"
__label__1,"Installation Nightmare: I can't tell you how many hours I have spent trying to install the software. I have tried every suggestion I can find online. Installation fails but the printer function works. At least print quality is decent. Scan function won't work because of screwed up installation. Tried download from HP, same problems. I can't believe it's this difficult. Won't buy an HP next time around, which may be soon if I throw this thing out the window."
__label__1,Just a fancy note book: Dont be fooled into thinking that you are getting a new set of patterns or something that you have not tried yet. there is minimal basic knowledge and then the rest is pages of grid paper. Cute and functional to a point. But not what I expected from this author.
__label__2,"By far the best in its genre!: I bought this book years ago when I bought a half share in the harvest of a CSA in NJ. At the end of the season, we were overwhelmed with crates of tomatoes. So, I learned how to can tomatoes and make tomato juice (love a good Bloody Mary!). Even with only a half-share, that season I also learned how to freeze greenbeans, strawberries and what you would expect to find grown in the Mid-Atlantic area. When I retired I moved to rural mid-west community. I bought copies of this book for my neighbors, and relatives. Anyone who planted a garden got a copy of this book. It is wonderful and straightfoward. Recipients include an ICU nurse, an IT professional and a dog-groomer. I have a very large collection of ""country living"" books, this is the one I go to over and over. Even if I don't grow it myself, I can buy wonderful locally grown produce in season. A very good companion cookbook is In Season by Sarah Raven."
__label__2,"Great stuff: This product did exactly what I hoped for, and while it wasnt all that good at filling cracks over 1 1/2 inches wide it was perfect for smaller openings. It was easy to use, and to get into small spaces, it solidified well within the stated time and was very easy to cut and shape. I will definitly be using this product again."
__label__2,"A bit let down: I recieved the movie a week ago was really looking foward to watching it. After reading the reviews i thought it would be really exciting, but i was a bit let down. The creatures were not shown until almost the very end. And then they were really kind of cheap looking. But to be fair the movie was entertaining, for an old sci-fi."
__label__1,"Boundaries: Poet and teacher Jeff Mann shares his influences and memories in this collection of essays. Through travel to places such as Scotland and Key West, he connects the foreign to the personal and ruminates on family legacy, gay life and literature, and the trials of being a leather bear. Mann is an accomplished writer, and these essays are well written, but certain points are repeated over and over, creating tedium for the reader. And unfortunately, he doesn't elaborate much, so by the end of the book, the reader is not left with a clear picture of the whole man he has become, but rather is only briefly acquainted with the plethora of identity aspects Mann claims. Despite this, there is still much to enjoy here."
__label__1,"Joints are crap: Each time I use this the joints fall apart. I have pushed them in as tight as I can with no resolve. Do not buy this, it is horrible despite the 'good' reviews."

__label__1,"Slightly fresh slant on a standard B movie theme: A typical B-rate movie that does show a few flashes of originality. Basically, a substitute teacher at the ""high school from Hell"" decides to take matters into his own hands. He ends up kidnapping a group of 7 of the worst students and locks them in steel cages in rural Texas. In the midst of nudity, deprivation and electric shock disipline, they finally accept that they must learn or die! The characters, although grossly exaggerated, are really despicable enough to make the mistreatment at the hands of their captor almost enjoyable. From Bob Sage in Las Vegas"

__label__2,"wonderful!: I loved the first one, and I love the 2nd! the cgi is better, the black light stuff (blue glowing eyes) is better (there isn't the blacklight glow all over the place). a must for all Dune fans! I personally hope there's another one that comes out!"
__label__1,"save your money for Physical Organic Chemistry - by Dougherty & Anslyn: This book is written at the undergraduate level. The figures are a joke. It's a paperback and will fall apart. If you are in graduate school; buy the text by Anslyn & Dougherty instead. It is a nice hard bound book, durable & weighs a ton. Its worth the money and the weight in your backpack."

__label__2,"Best damn album you'll find: You gotta ask yourself how the hell does he do it. Trent Reznor constantly blows away everyone with incredible sound and lyrics. No one can match the talent of Nine Inch Nails. This CD will never get old. I've listened to this over and over since the day I got it in 94. I can guarantee that there is something in this masterpiece for everyone. If you're a heavy metal person, you got ""March of the pigs"", if you engoy instrumentals, you got ""A Warm Place"", if you're into some kinda slow rock, you got ""Pig"", if you like intense stuff, you got ""Mr. Self Destruct"". It goes on for every genre. The important thing is, no matter what, order this right now, you will not be dissapointed."
__label__2,Delightful read...: This book is something to read on a rainy day. It is beautifully put together and very mood uplifting. The suggestions do not seem all that outrageous to me and indeed could add that very necessary flair or as Diana would say PIZAZZ to your life. I love her suggestions for interior decorating. She talks about the pursuit of the perfect RED. How lovely to imagine living a life where your most important concerns are finding the perfect RED. And yes this book is probably for people who are already fans of Diana. Great pictures too.ACL
__label__1,"dry and uninteresting: I am a feminist and also very interested in the philosophical, linguistic and psychological intentions and positions of various feminist theories.This book reads like a high school history textbook, doing very little to consider the theoretical or historical considerations behind the cultures it examines. For example, 'In Egypt it was like this for women', next chapter 'In England it was like this'.If you are just looking for a perspective on what was going on with women at various times and places, and can keep yourself interested, this isn't so bad. If you want an enjoyable read, look elsewhere."

The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer). In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last five weeks have consistently died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10)."

I've had mine for about 6 years now and have no complaints. It is very bright with all those bulbs, but that's easily solved with a dimmer. Plugged into a dimmer, it creates the most beautiful mood lighting! Replacement shades are readily available, too."
__label__2,"Illuminated Rumi: I find some of the other rather pedantic reviews a bit troubling. I can, of course, appreciate that those who are more knowledgable about Sufism in general, and Rumi in specific, might be disappointed in what some obviously consider a lack of credentials on Mr. Barks part; however, as a relative newcomer to Sufism and the works of Rumi, I must say that this is an excellent place to start. No, perhaps the translation is not exact, but the combination of the magnificent illuminations, and the undeniable strengh and power of Rumi's poetry will move many newcomers like myself to do further, more in depth research and hopefully capture the true essence of the message. And isn't that the point? Start the neophytes slowly, so as not to overwhelm them; intrigue them, in order to guide them. Why else would I be here?"
__label__1,"Rearranged deserves note: Frankly, I hate the recent rock/rap bands that have cropped up. Well, Limp definitely falls into this catagory.I, however, was surprised to see a bit of musical inspiration amongst the haze. Rearranged is really a marvelous song. Definitely not worth the price of the album, but worth noting nonetheless."
__label__1,Not for Me: I had to buy this film and watch it as a class requirement - didn't like it in the 980's and like it even less now.
__label__1,Dissatisfied: I have ordered this product several times in the past and found it to be good. This last shipment was lacking in flavor and was greasy. After eating the jerky my hands were also greasy. This is a major quality reduction. I doubt I will order it again. Too bad as ordering online is so convenient.
__label__2,"Classic Album, Great Condition of Vinyl: This was a rare classic and gem I heard about and had to have. The vinyl when received was in GREAT condition.I love sitting back relaxing to a George Duke record. This album was recorded in Braziland is GREAT music. If you are a fan of Duke's bodies of work you WILL love this!"
__label__1,Worthless: Cheap. Poor connection. I have the software/drivers. I had to connect/disconnect several times before it would sync. It synced once. I haven't been able to get it to connect since.

__label__1,"Not For Me: The product probably works, but a few seconds of use told me that I needed a product more stable. The plasic platter had a warp and the cartrage tracked too heavy for my taste. I decided to return the item and look for another solution, which presented itself with my hooking my old, but very good turntable into my laptop docking statation. Too my surprise I already had a program to capture music from my old turntable and I did not need this product."
__label__2,"Interactive Self - Discovery: In order to be happy you need to understand what makes you happy, what makes you tick and what ticks you off. The strongest point of this book is its ability to ask the right questions to lead your self-discovery. If you are not intersted in active participation with your reading than this isn't for you. However, if you are ready to actually learn about yourself - not just HOW to learn about yourself - this book will be your favorite as it was mine! Enjoy!"
__label__1,"Super Reader: A young adult girl's book, basically, with Mary Jane worried about the usual high school girl problems. Can the other hot chick steal her boyfriend, formal dances, etc., etc.The twist is that she now suspects her boyfriend Peter may be Spider-Man, and the hero himself does show up in tights a couple of times.There are actually two of these it seems, and this is the second, presumably the first is how they got to be in the same school in the first place."
__label__2,wow!: I'm new to Jazz and I find that I love this stuff. I guess it's bop. This is a must have album for anyone. I highly recommend. I got it on vinyl which is still one of the best ways to hear music. Love it!
__label__2,"great piece: I am very happy with this changing table. The cubbie holes are perfect fcr the things that need to be in fast reach. It is sturdy and attractive. This is my second child, and I was pretty sure I knew what sort of thing I wanted....Only caveats are yes, it is complicated, not hard, but complicated to put together. My seven year old helped and we had fun. It took about 2 hours. It is also a very heavy piece of furniture, but that is why it is sturdy."
__label__1,"Not nearly as good as the E200 series: I got this for my son and ended up keeping it when he liked my E250 better. In fact I thought I had ordered the E250 and later realized I had made a mistake. BUT I LOVE the E250 and since this one was a new model I figured it would be just as good or better. Isn't that why a company changes things? To improve on it? Well they missed on this one.It is much smaller than the E250 and has a smaller screen. It has a flimsy feel compared to the E250 and when you turn it on it takes so long to actually start up, I thought it was not working. It does play though and it will be fine for what I want, I was just so disappointed."
__label__2,"great game but gets dull: This is a great game. I only borrowed it from my friend and it took me a few weeks to beat. I like the fact that you can customize your car from the performance, to the neon, to the windows, and all the way to the engine paint, and brake capillers. Wicked fun game, with awesome music, like all of the need for speed games. The only downside to the game is that it is really hard at level 99 to 101, which is good, but after that it is really easy, and blows the end of the game. it also get old after you beat it like most games, but it is fun to play with friends after it is beat, not just by yourself. It is by far the best street racing game so far, much better then midnight club. I would recommend buying it"
__label__2,"A GREAT THRILLER WITH A CRUSHING ENDING: This book is incredibly fast-paced, and up to par with The Firm. I was utterly outraged with the ending, and it caused me to lay awake all night thinking about it. Obviously, Grisham intended for this reaction and I do applaud him for emotionally drawing me in so tightly. I did like the happy ending of The Firm better, though. Oh and by the way, I think Nicholas Cage should play Patrick."
__label__2,"Great introduction to dominoes: I purchased this set of dominoes for my 3 year old while visiting an arboretum. It is such a cute and colorful set. She picked up the concept of playing dominoes very quickly using the animals. It's very colorful. My only negative to this set is that I wish it had more pieces. We played with 3 people and it was way too quick - but then again, I guess you don't want a really long playing game for a 3 year old. If it did have more pieces, there would be more animals and it might make the game even more challenging.Overall, I am very pleased with this set for children. It teaches dominoes but also matching and very very basic strategy with fun artwork."
__label__1,Poor Movie Making: I race a bicycle and so it wasn't hard for me to enjoy the movie simply because of its' content; however I was deeply disappointed with the quality of the movie making. Poor lighting and sound quality were the bigget annoyances.

__label__2,"BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR: Idyllic, seemingly charming little villages have provided some terrifying backdrops for some creepy films: WICKER MAN, THE OTHER, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, to name a few.Welcome to WAKE WOOD, an Irish village that becomes the new home for a young couple trying to deal with the tragic death of their little girl a year earlier.While all seems normal, a dark but intriguing secret brings hope to the grieving parents...but at what cost.WAKE WOOD is one of the new films made under a revised Hammer films banner and is quite well done. Aidan Gallen and Eva Birthistle are good as the parents; character actor Timothy Spall is fine as the eccentric town leader; and Emma Connolly is charming and chilling as little Alice. Michael Controventi's music is eerily effective. WAKE WOOD is an atmospheric thriller dealing more with the horror of loss and grief and the hope for one last goodbye. There's also a good twist at the end."

As others have said-it's a blatant money making ripoff that is capitalizing on brother Don. It is short, shameful, poorly written, poorly organized and the worst 20 bucks ever spent. Yuck!"
__label__1,"Not for Mountain Bikes: The rack will work fine for lighter bikes. Our two mountain bikes seem to strain the racks. One side hangs down under their weight, but still holds them up."
__label__1,"Pay your money, take your chances: As the other reviewers note, when it works, it's a pretty good player. But, the odds that you get one that works over the long haul is probably 50-50. We've been through two in less than 2 years. First one had the power supply connector go bad. The second one loss the picture. Not about to buy another one."
__label__1,"Not what I hoped: I ordered these because I had very sore nipples after nursing my daughter. I knew that exposing the nipple to air was supposed to help, so I thought these would work. However, I wasn't able to wear them. The shells are quite large, so unless you have a bra that is at least 2 cup sizes bigger than what you normally wear, they press into your breasts and become uncomfortable in a few minutes. I didn't want to order larger bras, so I couldn't use these. I never used the shells for catching leaked milk, so I can't comment on if that aspect of them."
__label__2,"Great Desk for an 8 year old: Bought this desk/table for my 8 year old son, to do his homework on. It is a great desk as are the chairs.The only issue/concern I had was with the screws during installation, and mainly the allen wrench style screws. As you are putting the chairs together, which use allen wrench head screws, you need to be very careful as you are tightening them as there is a good chance you might strip out the head and then you are scrwd (literally).Pros - Great solid desk for a child; chairs are wonderful too.Cons - screws (allen wrench style screws) for chair creation can be a bit tricky if you are not careful. But if you are careful and take you time and don't force it, then everything is fine."
__label__1,hate it: the time it takes to fill the hose that has to be completely free of bends and twists just to fill. meaning it has to be completely unraveled and laid out to use! if the pressure is to high (anything more than a trickle) it flys through the air like an escaped fire hose. Never would buy this again!
__label__1,"A shameful attempt to justify the unjustifiable: A book that ignores reality, and then some. The propaganda contained in this farce of a book has long been pulverized by works such as Marilyn B. Young's ""The Vietnam Wars"", Jerry Lembcke's ""The Spitting Image"", Noam Chomsky's ""Rethinking Camelot"" and chapters 5,6, and 7 of Chomsky and Edward Herman's ""Manufacturing Consent"". H. Bruce Franklin's scholarly work also exposes Lind's book for the drivel it really is. The American invasion of Vietnam was an absolute atrocity which no amount of rationalization can explain away."
__label__1,Wrong map: The description said 50 mile radius map of Raleigh. The image showed a 50 mile radius map of Raleigh. I received a map of Richmond.
__label__1,"Good for what its worth.: I have had this camera for about a year. It takes excellent pictures, but it does eat batteries and recently- it finally died. None of the pictures I now take come out. Sometimes they do and sometimes they have tons of thick white scratchy lines on them. This has never happened before. I always keep everything on automatic."
__label__1,"How to be your own god: 50 years ago the content of this book would have been called spritualism. Now it's dressed up in a touchy-feely package that says God isn't important, in fact you can be just like him. There are no wrongs or rights, just how you feel, today. It's just more of a cheap new age imitation of the real thing."
__label__2,Nice Book on Matrix Structural Analysis: This is a nice book on matrix structural analysiswith stiffness and flexibility methods for computerbased and finite element analysis.Includes all topics of interest in structures for civil engineering. Check it out from your library. It is asgood as any newer book on the subject. probably better.
__label__1,"Save your money: I needed something just a bit more useful than my old wooden miter box, so I got this at my hardware store. I am a single woman with an old house and just the occasional project. I'm moderately handy, but this tacky tool just frustrated me to tears.1) I don't know for whom it is ""ergonomically"" designed, but its handle is cocked at an awkward angle and made my hand ache almost immediately. Trying to create eight cuts for a picture frame is a terrible struggle.2) I have used it for three (very small!) projects with soft wood moldings and the blade is already dull. I cannot replace it anywhere -- there just simply aren't spare blades.3. It is almost impossible to adjust off a simple 45 degree angle-- the cheap plastic base won't hold true.I ruined a picture frame trying to hack through it with this dull awkward tool. I'm saving my pennies now for a powered miter saw."
__label__2,Salamander Synergy 237 AV Cabinet: This cabinet was easy to assemble provided you read directions and proceeded acordingly. Fit and finish are excellent. Very pleaseed with the way this produt was designed to let audio components breath.
__label__1,This movie sucks: Adopted brothers move to Chicago to live with a foster family and the young preacher turns the children against their parents. This movie is the lamest of the sequels to date. There was only one part that was good. And the finale completely ruined whatever chance this had to be a watchable movie. BOO!
__label__2,"uplifting: I am new to hearing and appreciating music. The Three Tenors was my first CD and I thrilled to all the tenors. Although I have heard that jose Carreras's voice has changed as he has aged and recovered from a near-fatal illness, his voice evokes emotion and seems to have a little ""sob"" in it. This CD gives me an opportunity to hear him sing the familiar, somewhat splendid songs of Hollywood. The purists who are adverse to opera singers singing popular songs will miss something if they dont hear this collection."
__label__1,"perhaps for a little, little girl: These are indeed miniscule. On my pair, the pink tourmaline does not sparkle as shown in the picture. It is dull and waxy in appearance.These might work for a 2 year old. They are gold. At half price, it's a toss up if they are worth the money or not."
__label__2,Great resource !: I used the text for a space planning class. It was well organized and there were tables for referencing anthopometric data quickly. I kept it on hand while drawing floor plans for easy reference.
__label__1,Please DO something!: I love the premise. I love the characters. I love the writing style. I love the banter and easy good humor. I love the stability of the protagonist. If only there were a story or a plot you could make a good book out of all these. Reading it was like having insomnia and staring at a digital clock that never advances.

I mean, here is a story about SELF-MADE women-- southern, independent women out there in the real world, living their lives on their terms, not what 'society' says is 'proper'. Jill cuts through all the facades and myths, and tells it like it is- basically telling us to get over ourselves, and live life to the fullest!! Jill and the Queens are all friends, and being a Wannabe is the highlight of my life!! Come on down, the parade is March 20th, we always need more wannabe's..."
__label__2,"Yoga Tiffany Family Yoga DVD: This is a great dvd for families who want to practice with their kids, whether they are little or bit more grown up. There are two routines - one geared for children under 7 and one geared for older kids. I loved the partner poses - it's basically playing with your kids doing yoga and I was surprised by how focused and strong my kids were (and by the fact, they wanted to do the poses again and again). Yoga is not competitive; it's not about getting ribbons or medals or having to wear uniforms. It's about learning how your body moves, how your breath flows and how to build strength and gain flexibility all while having fun. Because, if it's not fun and you are dong this with your kids, why bother? There have not really been good choices out there for family yoga dvd's so I am so happy that this product is now on the market!!!Family Yoga"
__label__1,"Very boring: This book showed little effort done on the authors part. It clearly was just a book thrown together with the mesh of everday things. Some good detail, but lacked an interesting plot to reach out to the reader."
__label__2,"Roots: In the early 80s, the Cocteau Twins defined a style that later morphed into what became known as ethereal or dream pop. In the late 80s, the Sugarcubes put Iceland on the map for quirky, sophisticated alternative pop. Meanwhile Sonic Youth was busy making a name for themselves with a raw freeform sound full of guitar feedback and other experiments in dischord.In the late 80s/early 90s a breakthrough band emerged to marry the ethereal Cocteau Twins sound with the discord of Sonic Youth. This was the amazing but short-lived My Bloody Valentine.On the heels of all these bands comes the next big thing out of Iceland, Sigur Ros. Radiohead and Enya might naturally come to mind also, as one drifts through this beautiful soundscape. Sigur Ros is definitely worth exploring, and this is perhaps the best album to start your journey."

__label__2,"pyramid 12 amp noise filter: I purchased this to wire up with my cb radio i recently purchased, and didnt want to hard wire into my fuse box, so i added this filter after my 12 volt lighter plug i had to elimate any noise i may get when the vehicle is running through my cb radio. It works just as i had wanted. Very easy to install following the directions. I am now noise free when the vehicle is running and the easy access of the lighter plug to disable the power to the cb when not in use or driven for a few days. overall very pleased. I would definitly reccomend. The only downfall is its sightly bigger in size than i had planned but wasnt a problem hiding it behind the cb radio location."
__label__2,"Excellent Creme: This is an excellent product, and it also lasts a long time. This creme helps to brighten skin tone, improve skin pigmentation, and even out skin tone. At first it may seem like it makes you skin slightly oily/shiny in the T-zone but your skin will learn to adjust to the cream. I highly recommend this product."
__label__2,Awesome Movie!: If you loved the first you will love this one. The story plot continues from the ideas left at the end of the first movie. As many reviewers have posted before about the Book of Secrets and the plot of the 2nd film I wont go into that detail here... Great family film and it is highly recommended. I and very excited and cannot wait for National Treasure 3!
__label__1,"Worst product EVER!: I chose this gift for my companies 10 year service award, I needed a new set of pans so thought it would be perfect! Received the cookware and used it for almost 3 months. I noticed that one of the pans had the teflon bubbling up on the pan. After washing it now there are patches of the non-stick coating gone! So, I thought I would just contact them, I filled out the registration card so it would be under warranty. First it took me 2 e-mails to even get a response from them. They they told me to ship it back to them, me paying the shipping of course and to enclose $7 for them to return the pan to me after they ""inspected"" it. They didn't say if they would send a new pan if I was getting the old pan, nothing. I'm sorry but me being the customer why am I to pay for their poor product to be returned to them and then pay to maybe have their poor product shipped back to me. No, I don't think so. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again!!"

__label__2,"Masterpiece: That's it. No doubt about it. Surely the best moment in Michael's career. The production is here very good and the songs are incredible. Only ""Tales of mistery"" is a little bit of letdown.Here are great riffs (""Armed and ready"",""Victim of illusions""), spectacular solos from Schenker (""Into the arena"",""Looking out from nowhere"") and a hidden gem (""Bijou Pleasurette"").Don't mis it."
__label__2,"Nothing Dead about this one!: Another great episode. Everything works.For life long fans it's a great story, for newbies the action should leave them looking for more."
__label__2,"One of the all time best...: It's really hard to describe this album without foaming at the mouth with praise, but I'll try. You know how there are some songs that just grab your attention and never let go (ie Born to Run and Free Fallin')? Well this entire CD is like that! The other big thing is to give the CD time to work it's magic on you. It took me around a month to fall madly in love with this album! Right now you can get a copy of Astral Weeks pretty cheap, so if you don't like it, it's not a big loss. But, if you do like it, you'll get the bargain of a lifetime!"
__label__1,"Not Display or Coffee Table Worthy: I bought this as a gift, and am very disappointed in how small it is. Yes, I could have -- and now realize I should have -- checked the dimensions, but I didn't.The photos are nice, but like others have said, there are not enough of them and the bottom line is that it is just not display or coffee table worthy."
__label__2,"A destructive and feral, yet modern, black metal masterpiece: On the surface this album seems to be yet another of Krieg's blistering black metal attacks, using walls of trebly guitar punctuated by eerie melancholic breaks. The incessant drumming and droning guitar induces a trance broken only when the pace slows and reveals pulsating guitar that resonates despair.But the album offers more still. For a start the sound is fleshed out despite having no bass and minimum guitar tracks. Destruction Ritual uses simple- almost undetectable- guitar riffs, hidden behind rhythmic drumming and blast beating; creating subtle melodies and messages. Partly thanks to reasonable production, but mostly due to the album's conceptual unity - its pure hate all the way.This album needs to be listened to as a whole, again and again, as doing so will unleash a message of hate, despair and destruction...a recommended album."
__label__2,"exceptional: First got to hear this in 2002, and I just couldn't stop listening to this. The score is so beautiful and emotional. The sound quality is clear, excellent. This cast is fantastic; Michael Crawford has an intensity in his piano sections that surpasses what many singers can do in the forte range."
__label__1,"Illegal?: The songs on this cd are great, but NOWHERE ON THE CASE DOES IT SAY THAT THE SONGS ARE SUNG BY OTHER PEOPLE! I bought the cd under the impression that they were originals...I feel like I was cheated out of my money. I plan to return it."
__label__2,"Spiritual edification: I haven't read anything by Metropolitan Kallistos that wasn't excellent and enlightening. Some of the topics that this book covers, and covers very well, are spiritual elders, fools for Christ, death, and universal salvation. This book seems to focus especially on the charismatic gifts within the Orthodox Church, which makes an excellent resource for those who want to know more about these are they are lived in the Orthodox Church. His personal conversion story, which opens the book, is also wonderful to read."
__label__1,"Rapturous Book - not!: Oh dear, what a mistake I made in thinking this sounded like a good thriller in the making. What it is in reality is religious propaganda - can't believe I was sucked in. Didn't bother past the ""revelation"" of the RAPTURE. Beware of the freebies!"
__label__2,"A music fan from Massachusetts, US: Excelente interpretacion de algunas de las mejores canciones romanticas de America Latina. Los arreglos no siempre agradan al principio, se~nal de que el disco no esta dise~nado para ser musica ""facil"". La interpretacion y el arreglo de ""Negrura"" es una obra maestra."
__label__2,"Austin Powers: Austin Powers is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The movie is a laugh out loud riot, and it'll have you begging for more. The story is about a secret agent that's cryogenically frozen for thirty years, so he can catch his old time adversary Dr. Evil. Although the story is a bit far fetched and predictable, it doesn't ruin the film. The movie does a great job making fun of one of America's outragious decades, and it pokes fun at a lot of spy movie cliches. With so many sexual jokes about the sixties, this film never stops being interesting. Overall, it's a great film to enjoy.Also, the DVD has an incorrect framed transfer.The DVD presents the film with a ratio of 1.93:1, when the film's ratio is actually 2.35:1."
__label__2,"Perhaps, the best western series of all times!: Is it necessary to say anything about Clint Walker? I believe not. This is a 5 CD epic collection containing 15 episodes (Spanish subtitles also) where you will get as much adventure, action, courage and justice as you can take."

__label__1,"WarioWare Smooth Moves, skip it altogether, or prepare to be disappointed, I'd give it zeros stars if I could: I have no idea who this game is designed for or why it some people are giving it good reviews. If I had purchased this game instead of renting it, I would have immediately been looking for a buyer. Like other reviewers have pointed out, the minigames are extremely simple and pointless. Shake the remote like a salt shaker, wow, you're on to the next game. Flip an imaginary pancake. Wow, next game. Point it like a flashlight...wow... Got it? Don't get it!If you compare this game to Rayman Raving Rabids, Excite Truck, Zelda Twilight or Tony Hawk Downhill you will see a huge difference in level of design, imagination, ingenuity, graphics, forethought, programming, etc. The only thing this game has going for it is hype and a name people recognize."
__label__1,"What a shame: Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd. I was offended just reading every name on this cd...It is really a shame, what pretty ""vulgar"" voice. If this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears. You should be ashamed of yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on prepetuating hate. Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america. The first song I ever heard of hers ""Mississippi Goddam"" made me cry, so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice. There will always be a ""racist america"" because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist. I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics, one less sale adds up after awhile."
__label__1,"funny start, creepy finish: The first part of Naked I found hilarious, especially the the Sedaris mother with her frosty hair, Dinah the Chirstmas whore, and the mystery of who is using the household towels as toilet tissue. But as soon as the book went into the hitchhiking it got really creepy and never got back its offbeat humor for me, just disturbed me. I recommended tuning into the author's sister Amy on Comedy Network's ""Strangers With Candy Instead""."
__label__1,Voyage of the Green Mist: I handled the changes they made to Prince Caspian. I think most of them were positive. But this movies only resembles C.S. Lewis's plot in a hand full of ways; the biggest one being the fact that it takes place on a ship.
__label__2,"Nice Summary: Great book with a nice overview of Airbus Industries, from the company's origins to the present, as well as a look ahead. As the world's only true competitor to the USA's Boeing, Airbus has solidified their ground in the world marketplace as a premier commercial aircraft designer and builder. A must for any enthusiast."
__label__1,"BLEH...: This is blasphemy. It should be made with brown sugar and butter (topping) not their disgusting topping mix containing partially hydrogenated soybean oil, cottonseed oil and corn starch. The topping was absolutly DISGUSTING. Not to mention it makes only a very small cake. I will NEVER EVER EVER buy another Betty Crocker Pineapple upside-down cake mix again. I would have given negative stars but you can't do that. So for the incompetent people who can't cook or taste anything, this is probably right up your ally."

She's untalented and fat, and as someone has pointed out, is better off in law school where she can practice her being obnoxious. She's no different from that other overrated non-singer Donald Duck Barrino."
__label__2,"great for the money: I read the reviews and was a little skeptical, hear a lot of bad stuff about ncstar products, but i imagine they have this made elsewhere and stick their name on it. For the price you cant beat it, its only twice as much as a slim rifle case without any pockets. The picture in the description is slightly different than the one i got. ordered camo, its a off pattern of digital army, but not too bad. also the trim was not black, but more olive/foliage in nature. not loaded it up yet but before you buy take a look they offer several sizes, just as separate listings. in case you want smaller or bigger. One other thing to note is,the flap for the pockets opens and gives you access to all pockets at once, just keep that in mind when you open it so nothing falls out due to gravity. its more than enough for airsoft, and seems fine for rifles. once i use it a few times ill see if it holds up, but it feels sturdy enough for what it is."

However, if you have an IQ that registers in the double digits, know anything about the Bible AND Church history, and don't have black helicopters flying over your backyard, then the only good use you will find for this nonsense is to line the bottom of your bird cage or blot the area of your carpet where Fido has soiled it.Want to refute this gobbledygook?

__label__1,"TW reaches beyond his grasp.: I looked forward to reading this novel after finding Bonfire of the Vanities somewhat amusing. However AMIF was a deep disappointment. I found the prose clumsy and the plotting overly contrived. TW clearly has little real contact with black America given that his use of African-American slang is consistently off and his attempts to recreate rap-rhymes were painful to read through. He simply lacks the experience and I suspect the skill, to pull off a credible story using the characters he has created. Also TW seems to equate cynicsm with balanced satire. I have rarely been as happy to finish reading a book."
__label__1,"Plante-ing Pere: This is not a book to cheer you up. It purports to be a family story, the occasional gatherings of seven brothers at the home of their aging parents. But there's no glow, no real sense of understanding. Instead it has all the pettiness of family squabbling, too many tears in general, and all the dreariness of old age. It's written in short, choppy, irresolute sentences. It's not a book you quit in the middle, anymore than you would leave the room when a somewhat tiresome neighbor comes to call, but - as with the neighbor - you can't help but be glad when it's over."

I really hate to hop on the band wagon, but this album hurts. maybe if it wasnt a MDB album I wouldnt judge it so harshly, but I almost feel betrayed. It would be like being married to Cindy Crawford for some years, and out of the blue she gets a sex change."

My mac kept mounting the external disk from time to time, and my printer software kept poping up connection error window. The most annoying thing is my wireless mouse, it lost connection very often. I have to get rid of it, and change for another hub.By the way, it would get quite hot if you have it working days and nights."

I found one for half-price at a local bike shop - good deal! I tried it on the air shocks and discovered the anti-air-loss feature. Worked quite well! A solidly made fitting. Works great for tires, too! I've only used it with hand pumps, which usually work best for bike tires and air shocks. Had no problems. Seeing how well this little adapter works, I went back to that bike shop, while they still had some left, and bought an extra one and a few to give to friends! They really like it for their bikes, too! One caution: be sure not to over tighten the knurled fitting onto your valve stem to prevent crushing the little O-ring. A simple, yet fine quality product."

I had certainly hoped that this would not be a disposable, but apparently it has become so.Very disappointed."
__label__1,"so - so: Not overly impressed. I can't change the names of the main components (i.e. TV,Cable... ) I would like to have changed the names to work for the systems I have, which ended up being a moot point since the remote does not seem to interact with Wii systems (and lets be honest, if I had known that upfront I wouldn't have purchased this). From what I can see it doesn't do a whole lot more then what every other universal remote on the market does. Now before someone tells me that I need to ""learn the remote"" I have read all the documentation provided, and when I tried to log onto the Universal Remote website, every PDF link for this remote was down, plus 75% of the suggestions when I searched on RF20 where just pages that told you how to buy one - so I didn't find a lot of help there either. Just my two cents. Now if you have a PS or Xbox, this remote seems to work for those."
__label__1,"Shallow and Stupid: I was shocked to see that this book garnered so many positive reviews! Being a persistent person, I hate to start a book and not finish it, but let me tell you, I really considered giving up on this book. I tried to get into it, I really did, but it's hard to like a book in which the characters are so...annoying! I loathed Bridget and Tibby, but I found Carmen, at times, refreshing (although somewhat stereotypical). The story was trite and predictible, a tale of adolescent discovery and growth that has been told many times and in much better ways. In conclusion, I do NOT recommend this book to anyone that wants complex, original, likable characters and a refreshing story."
__label__1,"Could have been the best Buffy novel -- but it isn't: A book with an interesting premise and some clever writing that could have been the best Buffy novel to date, but that ultimately misses the boat. The Aztec god plot is interesting, and some of the characterizations of regular characters are good, but the use of Angeles for Angelus is extremely distracting, and the most important character -- Buffy -- fails to convince. Not a total waste of time, but not the greatest read either."

The three leveling screws make it easy to set up, too. This instrument also comes with stadia lines, which can save time when doing rough distance checks, especially if you are by yourself! This is a good heavy duty instrument that can take some abuse and keep on performing."

This book is about a boy named marco and his mom doesn't wan't him to play sports because she's afraid he'll get hurt. One day he sneaks out and plays softball and gets hurt. He then gets a call from a boy named Keith who says he lives in Marco's basement. I would say this book is one of the most unique books in the goosebumps series. This book in my opinion is still worth reading."

Someone might find it interesting and the only reason why I gave it more than one star is because it's decently well written. It disgusted me though.

On their own the speakers didn't impress, but I knew from reading other reviews that they would need a bit of a baffle to shine.

As for the material, I thought it was a big comeback from the somewhat dissapointing 'Cornerstone' album, but not nearly comming back to the albums before that i.e 'Pieces of eight'(my all time favorite), 'Grand Illusion'.. I thought side A of Paradise theater could rival any previous Styx album with 'Nothing ever goes as planned', 'Too Much time on my hands'both are fantastic and 'Best of times', 'Rocking the Paradise' which are both very good, but to me there wasn't anything special on side 2, just average. I'd give side A 5 stars and side B 2 1/2 stars and the whole album 3 1/2 stars, but since there aren't any 1/2 stars in this rating system, I thing the cover design, design on the record itself, and the clear sleeve (which is probably the only record sleve I still own that isn't ripped) all deserves an extra 1/2 star."

Don't believe it. If there is any soft rubber, then there's only a tiny layer of it over hard plastic. They're not really squishy or soft. These would not stay in your ears that well, unless you pushed them in and that's just not comfortable.And, as another reviewer mentions, the cord is rather short. The sound is Ok, about as good as I'd expect from $10 headphones.I paid $9.99, which isn't a lot, but when you can buySony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)that are super-comfortable, sound great and stay put - for about the same price - why bother with these?I expected better quality from Maxell."
__label__1,"Not really a good case: Othr than the Canon brandname, the case is not a good one: (i) not enough protection, (ii) doesn't cover the whole camera, (iii) no room even for a single accessory (such as extra memory, let alone an extra batter). It's not worth it given that price. Well, if it's 5 bucks, I will have it just for the Canon-brand showoff....Get a Lowepro Z10 instead. BestBuy sells it for $.... It (i) fits my S45 perfectly, (ii) gives a much better protection for the camera, (iii) looks really cool, not bulky at all, (iv) has extra front (extendible) pocket for accessories; (v) has belt strap and shoulder strap. Finally, it's waterproof."
__label__2,"Prepare yourself for a total mood transformation!: I accidentally stumbled upon Amethystium, and quickly snapped-up both Odonata and the Autumn Interlude EP. This music is hauntingly beautiful and never fails to transform my day....especially if I have been under alot of stress! My favorite track changes on a daily basis, but stand-outs that I never seem to tire of are: Opaque, Dreamdance and Calantha.If you are a Mythos fan or enjoy Delerium, Vangelis or Phobos, you will get high while listening to this special music which will carry you away to magical place. I'm anxiously awaiting Amethystium's next CD!!"

__label__2,"AL & BOB: I really love this album. Al Cohn plays a mean tenor & he's joined by BobBrookmeyer. So it's the quintet + Brookmeyer. If you are juidged by the company you keep, this mis very good company indeed.I may be mistaken but Al Cohn was a member of Woody Herman's herd, the sax section included Stan Getz. Don't quote me on that.The Sax & trombone really have a great sound when they play in unison. I might mention that for an album which was made in mono LP so many years ago, the sound is amazing.Al & Bob steal the show here. The drummer & bass do a great job, but nothing special. They don't have to be. However the pianist takes some great solos.You'll love such tunes as ""Lady is a Tramp;"" Ill Wind"" ""S.H.I.N.E.;"" & ""I should care.""Ala in all, a great studio recording that everyone should have in their jazz collection."

__label__1,"So much promise... and not much else: This book started out well -an innocent, young woman is convinced by a reckless friend to attend a masked ball and is seduced by the man of her dreams. Yes, that introduction has been used over and over in other romance novels, but it can still entertain.Unfortunately the plot was far less interesting after their initial encounter. The main conflict revolves around the hero's inability to recognize the woman he seduced and his doubts about his wife's integrity. Despite his supposed love, the constant misunderstandings made me roll my eyes and groan with frustration.Potent Pleasures wasn't terrible, but it certainly didn't make my top 10 list."
__label__2,"Excellent !!!: This is a must for any Managing Director that wants to take his business to a totally different level - locally or internationally !!!Every chapter brings light to whole new scenarios to any business !!!The book has a lot of tips how to approach opportunities and how to exit from them ( if necessary !!!)Although along the lines you can taste the business experience and how Mr Cisneros and his team has continuesly grown their empire, the english translator might has lost some key elements that are not evident to a outsider of Venezuela. Some minor mistakes were found but I am sure future reviews should take care of them.Probably due to time and other factors, details of certain marketing strategies and negotiations were missing so the reader could not taste fully that particular flavour, however, I already have enough ammunition and few new ideas.This book should also be a must in any MBA program."
__label__1,"love the brand. hate this product.: Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!"

Cisco should be sued over the uniformly poor quality of these switches.Here's a hint: if a company like Cisco won't put their name front and center on a product, it's probably because they're cutting corners.

__label__1,"Smells like burnt crap: ecom you need to fix your review system. I noticed that some people liked this movie and some did not. In fact the reviews seem to be all over the place. This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ever. It was just sadistic. Everyone that saw this movie with me agreed..... burn it. I threw it away, I was not going to waste my time burning it. Besides, I believe they were being sarcastic. This is a terrible movie and I have to honestly try to understand who would actually rate this at a 5 or even a 4. Or a 3 or 2 for that matter. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie. Buy anything but this movie. DO NOT!!!!! pay attention to the people who gave this either a somewhat favorable or favorable rating. I'm so upset with the rating system on ecom right now. I know you don't know me I'm just some guy on the net, but I'm trying to do for you what ecom or the some of the other guys won't do for you. If you did buy this, remember, I warned you."

__label__1,"Buy the DVD instead: Take your pick between bad and worse.... the streaming video skips frames and is heavily compressed. Downloading the video via ecom's ""unbox"" app still results in noticeable compression. The video is full of artifacts and jaggy lines.This is a poor way to watch a childhood classic. I love this movie and I look forward to the day it comes out on bluray!"

I dont know if the writers ran out of time, ideas - both? but I have to think that at some point someone said - this really is bull, but fans will still eat it up, let's make some money!If you really love SATC, watch some series DVDs, even watch the first Sex and the City - it's 10 times better than this one, and I only gave it 3 stars. Don't waste your time or money on this. I wish I had not."
__label__2,Nice but not what i expected: i saw this movie recently in this updated format. its good but was not what i expected from a all time horror classic. I am not saying its bad but its not worth the publicity it gets .
__label__2,Nice Simple Keyboard: I bought this keyboard to upgrade from a microsoft photo keyboard and I am NOT disapointed. I like wired products over wireless due to no having battries die on you wile gaming. The back light is very nice and great in a dark room. only down side is that at a 30 degree viewing angle you cant read the keys but at 45 degrees its perfect. The dim setting on the keyboard is kinda pointless cause its just too dim to see but on the max setting its just right. The keys are nice and responsive with out and delay or sticking.Purchase and you wont be disapointed
__label__2,"There's a reason it's called Joint Operations: The out-of-box experience was a little frustrating. Thanks to a little bug, if you played through a router, you'd sometimes have trouble connecting on a NovaWorld server. A few days later, a patch was available and took care of the problem.Once the game got rolling, it was a lot of fun. Hardcore MMOG gamers were working together to get the job done. The idea is TEAMWORK. Having a little bit of a plan helps a lot. If you try to take out the bad guys by your lonesome self, you'll just get to respawn more than everyone else.After several hours of playing, I'm ready for a little more variety. I'm looking forward to the expansion packs/redeux for this one."
__label__1,"Don't waste your time, just read the back.: I did not like the book. First let me start off by saying pages where missing. Not from being torn but they just weren't in the book. Oh and if your like me and like to read the back of the book to find out what the story is about. Don't do it. He tells the whole story on the back. I thought the book was about the mother but then it ends up being about her kids who we don't meet until the end of the book. Just crazy. It reads as if the author just made the story along as he was typing and then put it up for sale without a proof-reader. Very very predictable."
__label__1,"Disappointed.: I guess I expected a product that was easy to use and which yielded a great cup of coffee. Instead, using the MyPod, I only got a very small (four ounces) serving of weak coffee. And still had the messy clean-up! The only advantage is that you are able to use your own ground coffee."
__label__2,"Forever Jung!: This book is not an average introduction to Jung's psychology. It has pictures on most pages to better illustrate Jung's life and ideas. The writing style is informative as well as engaging, interesting, memorable, and at some points, humorous. It also explains Jung's split with Freud and some common misconceptions about Jung as a person."
__label__1,"Religious take on Tolkien: Unfortunately, despite the title, there is no ""behind"" the movies at all. No background as to the making of or powerbrokering of the movies. Furthermore the book is infused with a whole lot of religious mumbo-jumbo - one lot of fairytales trying to compare itself to another lot of fairytales."

__label__1,"The worst: Oh, the music is great, but what the other reviewers conveniently forgot to mention was that the songs are marred by a narrative introduction that is included on the same track as the song. In other words, you have to listen to the narrative introduction every time you play the song. Who wants that? It would have been great if the intros were on separate tracks but they were too stupid to think of doing the obvious."

__label__2,"A Young Serf Rescued by a Kind Master: We meet the young Vetch as an undersized boy, starving and struggling to carry a bucket of water too big and heavy for him. He is an Altan serf, captured in war and bound to work the land that used to belong to his father until he dies. Ari, a Jouster, a warrior mounted on a dragon, borrows the bucket to dump water over his head and then stops Vetch's master from beating him. Ari needs a new dragonboy so he returns the bucket but appropriates Vetch.Mercedes Lackey is at her masterful best in this wonderfully realized story of a serf who exploits the opportunities available to him. Her world is as gritty and as real as sand in the desert and the exhaustion of a slave, but her colorful characters and the mighty dragons they ride offer the gee-whiz wonder and magical excitement that keeps fantasy readers reaching for her books. Highly recommended."
__label__2,"Possibly the most depressing ending ever: I'll make this short.This was a short, quickly read book and a very worth while read. The old man is very admirable.I enjoyed the book and understood why it had to end the way it did but still left me feeling like some one had punched me in the stomach.Read it, it was good but depressing."

The Gamasonic lights never worked properly. The auto switch must be clicked on and off and on each night to get very limited light. A shame. I hope they improve the product one day... as solar lights are great when they work. The do not.
__label__2,A difference side of Richard Evans story telling. Good buy from ecom: Truly enjoyed the story. Very romantic and very descriptive of how other cultures treat women. Having an Italian background made this more enjoyable since I have experienced many of the same traits with Italian men that were described in this story. Also was great to read the Italian language phrases (might understand what some of my Italian relatives are saying). A nice surprise ending. Didn't want the story to end. Maybe a continuing story will occur.
__label__2,"Great teaching tool: Flip for Comprehension is a great table-top teaching tool. It lends itself well to small group lessons, independent reading time and literacy centers. Because the book is self contained in its flip format, the activities you and your students need are right at hand.During independent reading or while in literacy centers, students won't have the excuse that they don't have materials or didn't understand the instructions. Even struggling readers can use Flip for Comprehension since the directions contain graphics as well as words.The book is well planned out, with a good balance of text and graphics. I feel comfortable letting my students work independently using Flip for Comprehension after a brief explanation from me."
__label__2,"Thoughtful, well-written, and instructive: Art education is seldom associated with truly thoughtful discussion, but rather gets mired in pseudo-intellectual, rambling, meaningless phraseology. Art & Soul is refreshingly well-written contrary gem. The authors know art education, know art, and yet deliver solid guidance for artists of any age seeking to understand how God's Kingdom should influence their work.I highly recommend this book."

WOMAN ON DVD: Attack of the 50 Ft.Woman is a cheaply made horror movie from the fifties.It's certainly not on par with 50's classics like Them! or War of the Worlds but it still works and is great fun to watch.The print is very good and there's a nice commentary by Yvette Vickers and film historian Tom Weaver.I like these 50's movies and really enjoyed it!!!!

He was also given two rechargeable battery packs for it (which I highly recommend), and it really steams much faster with those. He loves it. Unfortunately, I have to knock it down one star, because there is only enough track for a tree loop. I contacted Lionel to find out how to get extra tracks for it, but they only make replacement parts, not extension packs. It does fit other g gauge tracks just fine, but you just can't combine the tracks with the original set. So, you either use it with the small loop of track that came with it, or you have to buy all new track to be able to make larger runs."

__label__1,"A big shortcoming...: I love Emanuel Ax and his playing, but there is a glaring flaw on this CD that cannot be overlooked. The recording quality of this CD is terrible! I first noticed it with the Rondo: Presto in the Sonata XVI:48 in C. Ax plays it wonderfully, but unfortunately, you can't hear it!!! The microphone sounds like it was hundreds of feet away, and all of the detail in his playing is lost in the endless reverberations you hear. Essentially, it sounds like he's holding the pedal down the entire time. Overall, this is not a good recording, and it distracts from Ax's wonderful playing."

__label__2,"Chopin: Etudes: The Chopin: Etudes is masterfully done. John Rusnak plays each piece effortlessly. It's obvious this pianist understands the intricate styling of Chopin - almost as if he studied with the master himself. Each piece has it's own unique character and the moods are captured perfectly. This CD will leave the listener wondering if it has been edited at all and well worth the price, especially tracks #3,4,6,8,12,14,19,23,24 which are performed exceptionally well."
__label__1,"Just didn't care of this one...: I've read much better JD books than this one.

The blade was razor sharp when it got here and the sheep's foot blade was sharp enough to shave paper as well. All the different accessories open with ease and are a tight snap to hold them in place.The cons: I'd say the lack of small screwdriver that would have come on the can opener is a big downfall. There is no tool on this knife to use in case of a small screw. also, electricians use scissors all the time. A nice heavy set on the back would have made this a $100 knife.

__label__2,"Overall letter grade=A: I would rank this as one of King's best. I believe it was his second book and reflects a period of King's writing that is unique and had great integrity in terms of composition. Some of the imagery is extremely haunting, especially the dilapidated mansion on the hill that holds much terror for the story's main character. It's certainly the best vampire story ever. It takes Stoker's Dracula and cranks it up a few more grisly notches."

Damon's character is torn between his duty and his obviously failing marriage and difficult relationship with his son. A great movie, in the tradition of LeCarre."
__label__2,"very best i've read: This is one of the VERY BEST I've ever read. I like american history, especially western history and civil war history. I prefer non-fiction, but I like it to read as fiction with good prose and literary style. I want to get ""lost"" in a book and this one made me want to go to Ariz and New Mexico.The description of the land was so beautiful and awe inspiring and of the people of that era, especially the Native Americans. I wish I could find another book I like as well. I love the writing style of Hampton Sides."
__label__1,Not worth it.: Just like any product you get what you pay for and in this case that was more true than I would have liked. Bought this in April 2012 and one of the fans stopped working in July 2012. Not even 6 months. I got nothing against Holmes and will still consider their better quality fans. Just expect much of this even if treated well.
__label__1,"I CAN'T BELIVE I DID THIS: I CAN'T BELIVE WHAT I HAD TO PAY FOR TWO EYE BROW PENCILS, THEY STOP SELLING THE MOST POPULAR COLOR. SO WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY SUCH AN EXPENSIVE PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT AND THEN THEY SHIP THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO (IF IT FITS IT SHIPS). PUT 2 SMALL PENCILS IN A ENVELOPE AND MAIL IT TO ME!!! NOPE THAT IS TO MUCH LIKE RIGHT.FROM A PERSON WHO LEARNED A LESSON"
__label__2,Straight forward.: This little pink book lists many gods and creatures from the collective cthulhu mythos. All the major ones you already know will be listed as well as many you might not. It is a straightforward book. Do not expect any stories or pictures and you will be fine. It is a useful refrence tool and as long as that is what your looking for then this is perfect. Yup.
__label__1,"AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE: I bought this router at my local Walmart.Followed the instructions to the T.Router would not let me access internet.Called NetGear Tech Support.Six hours later Net Gear told me to return it to Walmart.Glitchy product, poor quality control, poorly designed.Must Avoid Like The Plague."
__label__1,Very Unapealing: This book seems to okay irrational behavior and embracessomeone to not face their mistakes or upsets but instead have somekooky way to try to make everything seem fine. You can not go back and undo things that you have done to people who have died and by going through with that wedding Hannah really shows no responsibility for the situation she created. It makes me ponder whether the author just had a bad idea for a book or if indeed she shares this lack of responsibility for situations. I advise people not read this for it instills the wrong values in people and leads people to believe that they can just make everything ok again.
__label__1,"I was very disappointed.: I had wanted a battery operated lighted cosmetic mirror, not electric. There is another company that hasa battery operated one."
__label__2,"Amazing. Simply amazing.: It's now been over two years since I first heard Larks' Tongues in Aspic, and it's still probably my single favorite album of all time. It's a complex, challenging, dark, and utterly beautiful album that changed the way I thought about music, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in progressive music."
__label__2,"doesn't stick: After 30 years with a stainles steel pot, I grew tired of foods sticking to the bottom of the pot. Foods do not stick to the bottom of this pot! I love it! Its easy to clean,too."
__label__1,not what i hoped: so i read some good reviews about these headphones so i figured id give them a try. i was pretty excited when they arrived and they reproduced sound fairly well....atleast the right side did. the left side was defective of something. adio would come in and out like a loose wire. needless to say i sent them back.
__label__2,"This book has proselytized me!!!!: Everything I will do in the future will be based on ML and just one semester of an ML course & this book has converted me(even though my major is not Comp.Science). Of-course this is due majorly to Dr. Thomas Ioerger and his teaching abilities(Texas A&M), but the book presents all concepts(even seemingly complex ones) in a way that is easy and enjoyable to learn. One of the most useful books I've ever studied!"
__label__1,Stubborn Twig: This article was not worth the price. It shed no new light on the content of the book. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
__label__2,Stressed? A quick way to understand what is really important.: A simple story that both adults and children can enjoy. It turns your mind and heart to the real meaning of Christmas whether you are religious or not. There's a lot in this little book for everyone.
__label__2,"not complete, but close to it: My daughter is tatting for many years, and she were surprised to find many helpful little tips she were looking for separetely in internet and in library all in one book"
__label__1,Terrible Media: Recommend RiData DVD-Rs. I bought a 100 pack of the memorex with bad results and ignored customer support. Wasted money.
__label__1,"Average: Based on the reviews, I bought this book for my nephew's first birthday.The concept was great, but the abstract pictures and abstract poetry, I believe, does not resonate with the reader, be it adult or child."
__label__1,"Disappointing: Just finished Bagger Vance book. Took all I had to finish it. Oh, my, just not very good. A bunch of new age garbage. I can hear it now.... you just aren't enlightened. Fine. Skip this book."
__label__1,"great cd for a laugh: my best friend recently both this cd at a used cd store for a mere dollar.he hated it so much he gave it to me.i love this cd,it's great for a laugh.this guy has the funniest voice i ever heard and even funnier he and millions of people thinks he can actually sing and to think this guy is considered a legend in the music biz.some people are stupid enough to buy anything and nobody thanks you more than mr.dylan."
__label__2,"a really good book!: i thought this book was really good! it was the first avon true romance i had read and i really enjoyed it! It all starts when Ewan finds out he has to become the Duke of Brahm of England. WHen he's there he meets his brothers fiancee Anna, and they quickly fall in love. that part was my favorite because i thought i was really well described. then Anna figures out that richard (ewan's half brother) and her mother are plotting against ewan to make richard become duke, so she warns ewan! and richard even kidnapes ewan in order to force over the dukedom. while richard has to try to force anna to marry him.to see what happens read the book! it's soooooooo good!"
__label__1,errrr.: Fu*k this discrace to NIN fu*k it right up it's stupid ass.BTW I like half th bands on here.....or used to.
__label__1,"sad decision to buy: I received the Pedometer, It doesn't work. To return it is too expensive. I have read, and re-read the instructions, tried everything I know. For $7.00 I can send it in for repair, postage to send is probably at least 2.00 so I can forget that. A big mistake in buying mail order. The clip is strong."
__label__1,"Mocking the Belief of Millions: This is the book that made me swear off Dave Duncan forever.The first book, while slow from time to time, held a great deal of promise, and I was looking forward to seeing the interaction between those of our world, those of Nextdoor, and those from other worlds which were said to also connect to Nextdoor -- only that never happened.Instead of being given a rousing, epic tale of power, sacrifice, and triumph, we're given an unabashed and cynical debasement of Christ's procession and death. I kept thinking, as I was reading it, that he would sort of richochet away from it: that he would only touch on the matter briefly and move on. But he didn't. He mocked it, and millions of believers, right through to the final paragraphs. I was stunned, and I was appalled.I have read a great many books from Dave Duncan, and thought him a reasonably good writer, but I will not be buying another book from this author."
__label__2,"Quick, Easy and Economical: My shopping experience with Amason.com was easy, fast and economical. I love my new Sony DS camera and the Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo was exactly what I needed to complete my picture taking adventures. The camera takes great pictures and with the Memory stick PRO Duo I can take pictures and download them to my computer or take them to a local picture processing store and have pictures made any time that I want. I don't have to try to take up a roll of film before I get it developed."
__label__2,"Some five star songs, but a four star DVD: I love the idea of a concert with an orchestra, especially when the band is worthy of orchestral backing (take note, Metallica). Overall this was a great dvd, but i thought the song selection takes away from it a little (not a lot). I would have liked to hear more old stuff, but I guess I can't have my cake and eat it (never understood why I couldn't). Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was great, as was Octavarium (I LOVE that continuum!), Metropolis, and the entire orchestral part of the show. i just thought there wasn't enough diversity in the first set.My only other complaint is that the cameras in every Dream Theater DVD bounce around too much. Take note, mike portnoy- we wanna see musicians for more than half a second at a time. I realize it is hard to make a concert DVD perfect, but I am grateful to Dream Theater for putting so much material on DVD. More bands (see Symphony X) need to take note!!"
__label__2,"Wow.: Unlike most albums, this CD does not have a single dud. Every song is by turns exiting, beautiful, calming, heart-breaking, relaxing, cheering. All are breathtaking. Beyond my favorite CD - of many hundreds - this album grabs your emotions and mood by the lapels and shakes -right up until the last note and long after."
__label__2,Great product: Bought this product in October 2003 and give it 5 stars. It looks complicated but isn't and cleans very well. Had a few problems with some set in stains but when I took my time over them they came up nicely. It is a bit heavy but that's to be expected with the water and soap tanks. It's a great product at a great price.
__label__1,"Junk: I bought this for my child and he was so excited....until he tryed it out. He was try to spy on some of his friends and he could not take pictures because when he looked at the picture it was more far away and could not see anything. I said he could use it for normal pictures and he said it is embarrassing but he still used it for nomal pictures......it had been two weeks from when I got that and we went to a birthday party, kids were laughing and the glasses sliped of his face and broke. He was so sad. I think those glasses do look really embarrassing and dont work on spying."
__label__2,"The Train Delivers!: Originally I purchased this book because my Granddaughter's name is Sophia and I know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name. But I would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book. The pictures are bright and bold, the text right at the level of a preschooler AND it opens up to display a long train! A fun book to read together!"
__label__1,"buble blows: no sense of authenticity here, I don't believe him for a second when he sings these lyrics . . . truly unbelievable. His sense of pitch, phrasing, and swing are not impeccable, not natural.... i don't get why some love his kid . . . they must have never heard the real deal"
__label__2,"Game Changer: As a big fan of Joey, I feel like I have come to know who he is over the last few years through his comedy and, mostly, his podcasts. It's really cool and extremely interesting to see how he became the person he is and to get a glimpse into the world that created him."
__label__2,Money well spent on a great gift: I bought this as a Christmas present for my parents. They were very impressed that I was able to locate a cookware set that didn't cost a fortune and didn't come with glass lids. She is still enjoying this set to this very day...
__label__1,Brand New Strings - 6th E was a DUD!: Very dissappointed with these strings and will never buy them again. Went to rehearsal last night and found the 6th E string was a dud. Have never in all my years playing had new strings have problems but I did with these.
__label__2,"Wife loves it: Mothers day gift from the kids. Wife loves it, heats water quickly. Noisy, though, and the outside remains hot for quite a while. Not insulated. But works well and good value."
__label__2,Easy Entry into Greening Your Home: This book is a great intro into how to change the way you clean without requiring a trip to a specialty store. I've often felt at a loss for how to begin to make more eco-friendly choices. This book was written in such a clear and straight forward way that it was easy to make the changes. I found the recipes to be very straight forward and easy to implement with ingredients I could get at Target or the local grocery store. I think this is a great book for someone who needs a basic guide to get them started in the world of eco-friendly cleaning.
__label__2,"Wow...This is mind bending stuff!: if you crave for all those prog artifacts from the best bands of the 70's but wish there was a band that actually did not just copy the old bandsand came up with their own sound and ideas then you should check this latest cd from kenso. This guys are probably the best prog band japan has ever produced (except maybe for the offshot bands by drummer of Ruins). The 2 keyboard players are awesome and can get really complicated without being dense (one of the keyboard players is in a couple of albums by the before mentioned offshot bands from Ruins drummer). The guitar player is also great and is responsible for most of the compositions and the concept/sound of the band which is a mix of the best prog bands (think maybe PFM, Yes and Happy the Man) with a dose of eastern folk, and in their 2 latest cds a small dose of spanish folk(!) too. Great and highly recommended to prog fans"
__label__2,Good reading: Has some relivant topics. I'm always interested in hearing about IRA's and 401k's. Good reading for the novice.
__label__2,Best surger for the money I have ever owned!: This surger offers so many benefits of surgers that cost five times more. It is so easy to use and comes with a DVD for tips and use of unit. I would recomend it to anyone as their first time surger.
__label__2,anyone know a date?: does anyone know an approximate date for release of the box set? we have been waiting as well my whole family records the shows on dvr and its full... i like to go back and rewatch them but I dont have any more room
__label__2,"really fun and different top: the movement and sound inside this top really captures and holds the attention of my 11 month old. and his 3 year old and 7 year old sisters also enjoy it. this is a great toy for just observing when little (6 months or so). but when the child gets a bit older, he can start trying to work it on his own. finally, he will learn to master the up and down movement needed. good for teaaching motor skills and cause and effect. love this toy!I have to add that the music/sound effects are not loud and annoying. they are gentle and amusing."
__label__1,"Never got it!: They had it for sale, but then after I paid, they sent me an email saying they were out of stock! Bad business!"

__label__1,"Midnight in St. Petersburg: Since Michael Caine decided not to fulfill the two remaing films in his original contract from the 60's, he should have left this one for Jude Law, who he now endorses to play the new Harry Palmer. Let's hope he can get the project off the ground with ""An Expensive Place To Die"" penned by Len Deighton."
__label__2,Ordered a whole size bigger and they fit perfectly!: My daughter is 3 and wears size 8 shoes. I read all the reviews on this product and decided to order her a 9 and it fit her perfectly! I hope this helps other moms!
__label__1,"Are you kidding me!?!: Honestly, the violence blows. They took a great premise for the story and just went places they should not have. The special effects were interesting, not sure how to classify the techniques. They were kind of a live-action combined with digital animation. I'd avoid watching or buying this one."
__label__1,"kind of disapointing: I bought this to replace an 8 year old electric that blew out an internal gasket. It seems to work ok, but I don't really believe the power ratings, it seems similar to a unit rated at about 2/3 the water pressure. Also the rotating head did not work and the manufacturer was absolutely unresponsive both online and on the phone. I was never able to get it replaced."
__label__1,"beyond bad: I am a huge fan of Dorothy Garlock's Route 66 and Jazz Age books, so I thought I would read one of her older books. I am so disappointed. A horrible man rapes his wife over and over again and night and terrorizes her during the day. I kept waiting for her to get revenge, or seek help, but she never did. That's it, no need to read the book. I didn't even bother with the second story. Maybe its the book's age, obviously it was written at a different time, but I would hate to think our mothers enjoyed reading about this crime masked 'romance'."
__label__2,"Another Year, Another Chet: Years after Chet Baker's death, good-quality CDs of his trumpet-playing and singing continue to turn up. One of the latest is this 17-song English offering from 1960 recording sessions in Italy. In addition to the title tune, the CD includes ""Angel Eyes,"" ""Street of Dreams,"" ""Indian Summer,"" ""Violets for Your Furs,"" ""Goodbye"" and ""Deep in a Dream."" The number of songs and the price ensure that you can't go wrong by adding this to your collection."
__label__2,Forensics Duo Series Volume 2: This book was delivered in excellent time and in the condition that was indicated in the advertisement! Wonderful!
__label__1,"Streaks and Smudges: I can't get this replacement cartridge to print without streaks and smudges on the page. I would definitely not order it again, despite the appealing price."
__label__1,"A Study in Sorrow: This book should have been listed as a tragic novel rather than a romance novel, albeit written well and the story exemplifies true love, it is NOT the reason I read romance stories. I read romance novels for escapism and some form of happily ever after, this book was nothing close to either. Truthfully, I was left sad and angry and that is just not the reason I want to read a romance novel. If I wanted to read about the tragedy of war and the unfairness of life; I would simply pick up a newspaper. I know life can't always be happily ever after, but for me the only stories I want to read will be. This book is about heartbreak and recovery, it was the saddest book I've ever read, purely sorrowful. I found nothing romantic or salvaging about the tragic ending. I wish I'd never read this story!!"
__label__1,NOT HD: I have more than enough bandwidth and still I had to watch this in SD. I watch a lot of Netflix (in HD) so I was shocked it was in HD even though I payed for HD. The movie was pretty good.
__label__1,"Playtraining Your Dog: If you are interested in the dry technical aspects of training it's a good book, but as an educational tool to be read by the whole family, it was not the book of choice. The New Complete Dog Training Manual was read by the whole family (ages 7 to 18) numerous times and served as a guide."
__label__2,"Everything is Alright...: As a newbee to the whole HD world, I was hesitant at first.The "" Best"" company where I had bought my TV and everything else suggested that I purchase these 100 dollar 4ft long cables..So I bought them. A knowledgeable friend saw what I had paid for them and slapped me in the face a couple times.. and pointed me towards these cables.No problem what-so-ever and my wallet loves me 80% more!Great buy!"
__label__1,Too bad!!!: I am extremely disappointed.All figures come off when washing for the first time!This is really a phony item I've ever bought on ecom!Extremely expectations!We hope that no one be fooled like me!
__label__2,Great storage unit!: This product was purchased for a 5 year old who loves doing arts and crafts. She loves the multitude of supplies. I love the handy place to store everything. We even added more items to the center to store without problem. A great buy!
__label__1,"Don't buy this if you have a newer model iPod.: 1. The ecom.com description of this product says:""Compatible with all iPod models.""2. The manual says, ""Please make sure you are usingthe correct insert for your iPod and that it is properlydocked into i177. Failure to do so may cause damage toyour iPod."" (Page 9)3. Their manual also says, bizarrely, ""i177 comes withremovable dock adapters to ensure your iPod fits properlyin the dock on the top of the system. Due to new iPodmodels, new dock adapters are subjejct to availability."" (Page4) (in other words, if you need a new dock adapter, you may not get one. I didn't.)4. I have written 2 requests to their support site, with noresponse at all, not even an acknowledgement that theyreceived my note."
__label__1,Shaver battery: All went smooth but battery does not hold charge well. After 3-4 days of non use needs a recharge. Vendor or batt manufacturer problem? Don't know and will not judge vendor.
__label__1,Mediocre quality: I was not prepared for the bad sound. But as a diehard fan this was an important add to my collection. Nice to have the collected to one item. Very nice booklet.
__label__1,If you like your music MONO this is the product for you: I have to agree with the other reviewer - I too have experienced left ear failure on these units. Must be a design flaw. Since repair is not an option on this unit (per Sennheiser's website) I have opened it myself expecting to find a disconnected cable - no such thing. It just doesn't work. Recommend you avoid these unless you like your music in mono.
__label__1,The Five People You Meet In Heaven: Book of course is fiction. Read about the First Person You Meet IN Heaven and closed the book. Would love to have my money back. Very strange to be talking about Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't want to read anything that confuses me and makes no sense at all. Other people in our Church feel the same way. Many that purchased the book feel the same way as I do.
__label__2,"WHY????: I am still unable to believe that whoever owns the rights to this television show does not yet have the brains to understand that there are legions of fans out there who would purchase the entire series on VHS and especially DVD at any cost!!! I was so happy to see that at least three episodes are now available on DVD. I am in my thirties, and I and many of my friends still love this show, make enough money to purchase a box set (hint hint) and eagerly await it's release on DVD! Wake up owners! I obviously think that this DVD was wonderful and I hope for the rest soon!!!"
__label__1,"Not very useful...: I bought this for taking the ""good jewelry"" with me when I travel, but it really lacks usable features. I found it too small to be practical.The ring bar is so skinny that your rings end up rubbing together. It does have a couple of small pockets in which you could put rings or small earrings, and two medium-sized zipper pockets that might hold a bracelet or small watch.If you really want to take your good stuff with you, look elsewhere. If you just want to bring a spare ring and a pair of earrings for a weekend, this would be okay."
__label__2,"Locations: I love this book for its functions and cross referencing. It is great! The only draw back I have is while you are in the bible, it does not give you a header of where you are on chapter & verse. There is a header at beginning of chapters and verse #'s within the verses, But I mean a header to keep track of the chapter you are in. Also when you bookmark or highlight a verse or section, it gives you the location description, not the actual chapter & verse that the bookmark or highlight was saved from. Can this be added to the book? I sincerly hope so."
__label__1,"Item Defective, Returned Item promptly, Seller did not refund: What else is there to say? if you are selling a candy mold that is suppodly designed to make candy, then if the item ""collapses"" when you pour the hot sugar mixture into the mold, AND you BURN yourself, then, why not refund the purchase entirely AND go back to the manufacturer? First time we had a mold fail. Returned item at my own expense with a letter explaining the mold FAILED and I ended up in Urgent Care with 3rd degree burns. Seller wrote letter back and said ""Item was used so we are going to give you a partial refund."" How about I send them the bill for the injuries sustained as a result of a poor quality product?Avoid .... this ..... Seller"
__label__2,"Music from the Motherland: When i first got the album i didnt know what to expect. Once i listened to it i was amazed. The album has a mix of house and late nite club grooves intertwined w/heavy african elements (i.e drumming, chanting)This album is a definite purchase, especially for those wanting someting deeper in their music."
__label__2,"Good rock music: This is what i call rock music good beat and good lyrics, don't listen to the other reviews. This cd is one of the best, listen to a few songs and you will get hooked. I recommend this cd its awesome."
__label__1,"Battery life disappointing: It's a fairly good trimmer but the batteries do not last very long. If I charge it and use it a few weeks later, it will not last as long as I need to trim my beard. You have to leave it plugged in charging all the time in order for it to be ready when you need it. I have had several Norelco shavers and none had this problem. In the future, I will probably look for the Norelco name. I thought Remington was probably a good name brand but now I am not so sure."
__label__2,"Why Am I Always So Tired?: This book is very insightful with advice on why some people may be tired all of the time and are told by their physician(s) that there is nothing wrong with them. ""Copper Overload"", as the author calls it, could be a primary reason for why so many people are always so tired. I mainly bought the book because I have suffered with this problem most of my life. It started with me when I was in High School and now I am in my mid 40's still combating this problem. I am an adult male, and although the author states that this happens primarily to woman, she does not discount that it also happens to men as well. She gives reasons as to why the reader may be suffering from fatigue all of the time and shows the reader ways of combating this illness."
__label__2,"Blood and Guts from an old Enemy: When this first came out, of course it got maybe a half a star, but, of course, I used to live in a BLUE city along the southern Calif. coast line! Since I love this kind of movie anyway-6******'s! It does show war, pain, suffering and death as it should to probably prevent future ACTUAL w, p, s and d! I like the DVD extras, the interviews with the stars of the movie, I was kind've hoping that Jennifer Grey would be interviewed but, alas, no. All in all I liked it! For those who take themselves way to seriously-lighten up-it's just entertainment!"
__label__1,"Convoluted: Didn't like it, but it does make you think. Mostly because you can't figure out what's going on half the time. Here's my take on the ending: Hackman's character atually does have a pedophilia problem (first meets his wife when she's 11 and he's like 50+; spends more time with the niece than the wife; has all sorts of pictures of very young girls - including the murder victims) and by confessing to the murders he both acknowledges this and escapes from his wife, whom he can't seem to stomach. It may be that Director Hopkins is making a statement that there's not much difference between the murder's lust and Hackman's lust. Or that appearances are deceiving. Or both. In any event, it's a pretty depressing film. The next video I rented was Rocky and Bullwinkle - at least I could sort out the good guys from the bad guys in that one....."
__label__1,"Not as good as expected !: This book does not impress me as much as it should mainly because it does not carry much details about each of the commands, like defining what some words stand for.Maybe I had hoped that it will be something like the DOS6Running Start ISBN of 981-214-445-5 which is a superb book that has examples for each and everyone of the command unlike this nutshell one.All in all, the book fails to express out the OS fully which Linus had created."
__label__1,"Skip This Book: This book is worthless and the math is someimes wrong. The author wants you to go through the statements and find the EPV. He believes that WD40 company is a good bet. In one case he goes through many calculations only to find that it was not necessary. Net income is not a good number to use to calculate value. Buy Sham Gad's book about value investing; he knows that it is cash flow that determines value, and you can use this to calculate intrinsic value. Gad's book is well written and extremely informative without being filled with useless information like this book."
__label__1,"Nice looking but ineffective: I got these for my sliding glass doors as a security device. It looks very well machined and shiny, but it doesn't keep people from opening the doors.The way it works is that the lever has a wedge shaped inner surface that pushes a metal slug into the U-shaped gap inside the device. It's supposed to press the slug into the sliding rail of the door to keep the device (and hence the door) from moving. Unfortunately, the lever doesn't lock in place, and the metal inner surfaces are not very good at gripping the metal track of my sliding doors, so all you have to do is repeatedly push the door against the lock and it will slide the lock down the rail and allow the door to open while the lock is still locked."
__label__2,"6 Mo. Baby Boy LOVES IT!: My 6 mo. old just loves his musical mobile! He usually lies in his crib for at least 30 minutes just watching the animals circle ahead. Sometimes, he can go for 45 minutes. I never figured out how to make all 3 songs play one after another, so I need to manually change the songs. I also wish we could control the volume. But I'd definitely recommend this!"
__label__1,"Maybe EA can change the name to Spoor...: I recall meeting and talking with Will Wright at an early SF MacWorld. He was standing alone, mostly ignored, trying to generate interest in a new game he'd developed called SimCity. Delightful guy, and I ended up writing a few articles for the early SimCity Newsletters distributed by Maxis.I skipped all the Sims bits, but have followed the Spore trail for a couple of years, reading interviews with Will about his vision for the game. I don't think the released Spore has more than a tiny bit of that vision. Dumbed down, loaded with DRM - sorry, but I think EA's influence has won out. Here's hoping Will revolts along with the rest of us."
__label__2,"Great Video: This dvd was excellent. If you're in anyway interested in the metaphysical and quantum mechanical world, then there would be no way you could deny its message. They really break down the law of attraction in small pieces so if this were the first time you heard of it, it would still be capable to grasp. The dvd wasn't too long and it definitely wasn't too short, kept my attention, and is easy to reference certain topics from the dvd chapter page."
__label__1,Disappoiting Theatrical Adaptation: Perhaps it is well that this version is not available. I have 24 different video versions of this great classic that I watch every year (as part of my Christmas tradition). But this 90 minute theatrical version is the hardest to watch. It's slow moving pace and harsh performance by Richard Hilger makes this version more of a chore than a pleasure of my Christmas tradtion.
__label__1,"Rubbish: I bought this DVD after reading the other reviews, which were all very positive. However, I found the DVD to be way too easy and way too short and way too dull. They kept doing these really strange poses and talking like they were on wacky backy and the guy was half naked, you could see his nipples poking out everywhere. Not really relaxing if you ask me."
__label__1,"Bandai Entertainment recall: I encountered the same problems as with all the other folks around here. Even though I got a replacement disc from a very prompt response by ecom, it still didn't play.So I tried using different players and even my computer to watch this DVD but the final chapters of the disc is just not playable. I even tried downloading a freeware player thinking it might solve the problem. It somewhat did the trick but the performance was very choppy to say the least.After browsing the web, I discovered that there was a manufacturing error regarding this DVD title (along with 3 other titles). Bandai entertainment has confirmed a recall and is willing to exchange already purchased disc with newly replicated ones. [...].I hope this helps a lot of frustrated folks out there a bit."
__label__2,"Great navigation system for the price!: I have now bought two of the Tom Tom ones for my son and step-daughter. The beauty of this item is its portability. You can pop it into a pocket or purse and for the most part, the directions are dead on. My step-daughter recently drove from CT to NC without getting lost, which gives me, as a parent, great peace of mind knowing that she will arrive to her destination safe and sound.My son uses the Tom Tom for his work doing pizza delivery. He has noticed that his tips are increasing because of his ability to get to the patron's homes without mishap. Also, when he doesn't need the unit, then his sisters will have access to it. Heck, the price is so good that I just may buy another one for the girls.I highly recommend any of the Tom Tom products. If you want an economical but very excellent GPS, then I would suggest getting the Tom Tom One. If you need a few more bells and whistles, then stay with the Tom Tom product family and purchase a model up."
__label__2,Good Contraption: Like this beast. Only downer is that I needed to plug it in to charge my devices. Nice to have one place to plug all the stuff in and the two top ports are handy for thumb drives and temporary connections.
__label__2,"amazing lights: goes off when light comes on, no need to replace light bulb-ever. plugs into outlet, no batteries needed either. love it."

__label__1,"Don't buy it: One week short of a year and the camera broke. Now, no image appears on the display in any of the 3 picture taking modes and no images are captured. I called the Sony phone number provided and got into a voice menu loop and hung up. When I tried again later it gave me the real person option. The rep was professional, but unsympathetic. For an estimated $147.34 in labor charges they would fix it. Sony online service support said pretty much the same thing only with a --you are talking to the wrong person-- tone. So much for Sony cameras."
__label__2,"good historical perspective: Although fictional, this book gives the reader a good perspective on the history of the middle east and help one better understand things about the current middle eastern culture."
__label__2,"This is the REAL WORLD OF TRUCKING!: I've been driving trucks for a lot of years and the stuff in here is dead on accurate. If you want to avoid getting screwed over when you get into driving you need to read this. There are tons of books out there on just passing your CDL test. That stuff is FREE at your motor vehicle office. You don't have to pay for it.The things in this book are what you WILL have to deal with in starting out as a driver, and even more so once you are really out there all by yourself. It is reality and some of it is pretty incredible. On top of it all, there is some really funny stuff in here. Once you have been driving awhile, it will all make perfect sense. This is real world trucking dudes, plus you learn about some different jobs that you might not ordinarily associate with trucking, and it has the coolest cover of all. If you want to go trucking, this book kills! Check it out!"
__label__1,"This book does NOT properly prepare someone to buy a diamond: Although the photographs are valuable, the book does not provide practical methods for determining color, cut and clarity. The information provided is too abstract and hard to apply in the jewlery store. The author doesn't provide specific information on diamond prices so you don't get an idea of how much you should spend on a diamond.I recommend reading ""How to Buy a Diamond: Insider Secrets for Getting Your Money's Worth"" by Fred Cuellar. His book contains detailed price charts on diamonds by every quarter-carat for every clarity and most color levels. He provides practical methods for determining color, cut and clarity (e.g. he advises putting each diamond in the crease of a white business card and if any yellow is visible, it's not above color level K). The latter book doesn't have glossy pictures, but it prepares you much better than this book for buying a diamond."
__label__2,"Fantastic: This version in Spanish is even better than the English version.The sound of the drums in the first song of the album (Dos Mundos)gives me a thrill.If you see the film, all the songs match with each sequence.I think Phill Collins has done a great job."

__label__1,"Weak Plastic: I bought this at Target. After I used it the 2nd time chopping green peppers, it broke! The tabs inside were sheared off and would no longer stay aligned. It's made of cheap plastic and is very weak. I threw it out and will buy some other brand."
__label__1,"Leaves a Lot to Be Desired: This is one of the most poorly edited books I have come across in a long time. While I understand that it's almost impossible to eliminate every single typo, the myriad of spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors on virtually every page distracts from what may be an otherwise entertaining, if rather predictable, story.The sex scenes are extremely disappointing, relying on foul language and little else to set the mood. While I am not a big advocate of using phrases like ""his throbbing manhood"", and agree that a few well-placed naughty words here and there can titillate the reader, the author goes way too far and just leaves you feeling crass.Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the book. It seemed like a very rough first draft of what could have been a decent novel."
__label__1,"almost killed my cat: Be careful to NEVER leave this toy out, or if the feather part breaks off (which it easily will) DO NOT leave it lying around. My cat ended up eating the hard red plastic tip that holds together the feathers. After vomiting 6x, he had to have surgery to remove it. Seriously a shame because my cats love playing with it."
__label__2,"Victimhood is a self-imposed state of mind: Dr Laura's easily digested wisdom tells us what we already know, but don't embrace. Regardless of the circumstances of our childhood, it is our responsibility to move on and make the best of life. Dr Laura reminds us that life is a fleeting experience, appreciated more as we mature. Instead of lamenting.regretting, bemoaning and overcompensating your past, move on and fulfill your future! I read it to help my son navigate an ugly divorce. It paid the dividend of reinforcing my conviction to live as fully as possible despite my own Felinisque childhood."
__label__1,"Hindsight: This was the first of many books I've read about Africa. At the time, I had a romanticized view of The Dark Continent, a naive view.After doing some more research, I realize Karen Blixen's view was VERY romanticized. Many of her contemporaries thought her somewhat odd and out of touch with reality.If you want a lyrically told story colored with emotion...this is for you.If you're interested in Africa as it really was, read a selection of accounts by settlers who spent far more time, and ranged over a wider area."
__label__1,"Save Your Money...: Don't waste it on this total piece of crap. I bought the H700 after briefly trying one belonging to a friend. It seemed to work much better than the terrible H500 I got free with my phone. It seemed to be less affected by wind and other background noise. But, within a week of getting it, it began to exhibit the same bad habits as the H500. Unless there was absolute silence, I would have to shout for it to understand commands. When, standing in my totally quiet kitchen, it couldn't understand a voice command to ""Call Mom's House"" about six times in a row, I took it off, dropped it on the floor, and stomped it into bits. The H700 is an absolute piece of crap not worth a nickel. The only headset I have ever tried that is worse is the H500. Motorola may make great phones, but their Bluetooth headsets are absolute garbage."
__label__2,Great read: Fun and witty. Great read. Hard to put down. Enjoyed it thou roughly! Highly recommend for a great quick read.
__label__1,"Give me a break: I love Shakespeare and I was really looking forward to this movie but when I saw it I was so dissappointed. I nearly left at the end when Branagh (playing Hamlet) is portrayed in a Christ-like crusifiction pose. Give me a break! Literary criticism aside Hamlet is no Christ and neither is Branagh! What was he thinking! The whole thing seemed like a mess to me, as if he couldn't make up his mind what time period it was set in. If you want to see Hamlet, don't watch this movie - go see it on stage!"
__label__1,Herbal shoulder wrap: I was thinking this would be higher quality. Its on the small side and fragrance from the oils is already gone. Your better off not buying...waste of money.
__label__2,"quality build: good construction, and not too heavy. my only problem was the shoulder straps were constantly chaffing my shoulders and nech area, even after fussing with all of the straps several times. aside from that it is a great bag. anf a great size. my brother and i went hiking up a mountain with narrow path points, and i could make it through just fine because the bag is not wider that me. my brother has an external frame bag (which does come in handy for many other things) but he had some real trouble making it through most of the tighter points."
__label__1,"Could not get RT314 to work.: Out of the box, the router did not work. I talked to tech support and they walked me through all the trouble shooting steps. Finally they suggested that I download the latest firmware and try that. I did, still did not work. I am returning it for the Linksys. My neighbor got a Linksys same day my Netgear arrived. His works, mine doesn't. Boo hiss."
__label__1,"Not for flat top electric ranges.: I bought this unpacked it and put it in a bag to go to my house at the Shore, and so did not look at it for months. WhenI put it on the stove today, I discovered how uneven the bottom is and found it unusable on my stove. Now I own something I cannot use, have no idea where to send it, and do not how to resolve this situation."
__label__1,"Heavy: I realize cast iron is heavy, which is why I only keep a few essential cast iron items in my kitchen. This thing weighs a ton! It arrived in a flimsy broken box that was not strong enough to contain the item. I didn't like the way it looked - it was rougher/scratchier looking compared to other cast iron items I have. I returned it. Also, lastly please note the return label was USPS (not UPS). Items this heavy have to be taken to the post office...not fun standing on a long line carrying this thing."
__label__1,"hummm...: hi there i have been a carpenter for 20 years, i bought this video because i like watching them and who knows i might learn somthing knew,,,,, my dislikes are.....1) while larry was cutting the 4x4 blocks for the girders he did not mark them with a speed square there for they can be out of square and cause one side to be low or higher the what the block was measured for.2)the way larry manoverred his skilsaw was a little on the scary side.3) while putting on the sub floor larry did not put any insulation under the floor, and that is code most any where.4)the stair stringers were off set by one inch, thats not a bascic set of stairs.5) also on the stairs larry put the stringers tight against the wall, every set of stairs i have seen there is eather a 1x4 or 2x4 at the bottom of the stringer and then put to the wall that way sheet rock can go down futher and carpet can be tucked.LIKES.... 1)layout, laying out the joist before cutting them, and hold nails all in the same direction. thanks..."

__label__1,"Not A Romantic Comedy: The premise for this film is HIGHLY improbable. C'mon. Not only is the story line improbable but it is just one long piece of propaganda. Don't be fooled, it's not romantic. It's not a comedy. Also, I wonder: How can an entire creative group such as the writer/producer/director/actors make such a horrible film? I mean, really, how do they rationalize doing this kind of schlock? One of the worst ""films"" I've ever seen. And... I'm not done... the tempo of the film was painfully S-L-O-W, the dialogue unbelievably D-U-L-L. Bleh, bleh, bleh. Hated this film. Okay. I'm through ranting. Sorry for all the negativity."

When it is in, it does not fit tight, it is very loose and wobbly.....i would spend the $20 on the real thingPoorly represented product of what you get, cable says Zune on it but either it is knockoff or one that Zune got rid of for cheap cause it wasnt made right.Dont buy, will not buy from this place again."

__label__1,Power 90 Master Series - Plyo Legs: The instructor is so irritating that I couldn't enjoy the workout. Thankfully there's an option to turn off his idle chatter and use cues only. Not sure why he has music playing because he never utilizes the beat.

__label__1,"Not a good timer for short periods: The ringer does not work if you set the timer to anything under 5 minutes. I thought that maybe my timer was defective and exchanged it, but the other one had the same problem. I was looking for a timer to use for child related activities, such as setting the timer for cartoon watching, time-outs/ins, etc and this did not work for me."
__label__2,"Clean and Christian: It's hard to find good media these days that is clean enough for the whole family, and even harder to find modern day stories of virtue and solid Christian principles. I was so happy to see what a great job Illumin8ed did on Stand Strong. Great Bible-based messages, full of real life lessons for young and old. It will have you laughing and crying. Definitely a keeper!"
__label__2,"Good defense mechanism: Good book. It explains all the mind tricks played upon modern & ancient human beings; such hypnosis, peaceful persuasion, propaganda, politics, etc. It didn't really teach me how to manipulate the mind of others(which was what I was looking for) but it did give advice on how to be aware of the manipulative practices used on mankind. Good advice does lie within it."
__label__2,Pampers: These pampers fit well and have great absorption. THey are light and my son feels comfortable in them. Also they work great for overnight protection.
__label__1,"High grade snake oil.: The author now has a trading website (smarttrading.com) where he offers a course teaching you not only to trade, but to be able teach _others_ how to trade, ""mentor"" as he puts it. Anybody stupid enough to fall for the rubbish claims of those ""selling shovels"" to traders deserves the losses that are nigh on certain to occur."

__label__2,Yum!: This is my favorite tea. Who knew strawberry tea could be so juicy. Give it a try. You will be pleasantly surprised.
__label__2,Comfortable: Old school sweats. Hard to find these anymore. Basic comfortable sweats. The sport grey seemed to run smaller than the ash grey color in the same size for some reason. Both still fit. Quality not to thin or extra thick either - in between.
__label__1,"good film, bad DVD, no bonus material: This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""The Sword of Doom"" known in Japan as ""Dai-bosatsu tge"" is a depiction of a samurai swordsman who is inherently evil and kills an opponent during a fencing match. The dead man's family pursues the killer.The film is very good and has some great scenes but the DVD has no special features at all except for the essay in the liner notes which I don't think count.This is the first Criterion DVD without special features for a long time and think it was a mistake for them to release a film without special features."
__label__2,DEEP TROUBLE 2 REVIEW: I would recomend this book to some one because it is a good scary book with lots of suprises and danger it is exciting and it has a special twisted ending
__label__2,"Small, But Great: This is a small vacuum, but it works and it works really well. The cord is a decent length so I only have to move it to a different plug when I change rooms in my apartment. Picks up dirt and dust decently. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who lives in a large house/apartment because of the size but for a small two bedroom its great."
__label__1,"New formula is a disappointment: I have bought this product for years, they just changed it and you can see the word NEW on the packaging.The product is so white and the texture is so thick now that you will feel like you are spreading white glue on your face and you look like a clown with white face.I wrote to the company but did not get any response. They also changed the formula of their serum and it is really bad, in fact you can check other review about their NEW line and figure it out.I am very disappointed as I really like the product the way it used to be and now will need to find something else."
__label__1,"Fluff and stuff: If you are serious about legitimate practice of Taijiquan (either a traditional style or standardized practice methods from PRC sports/P.E institutions) then steer clear of this. The instruction is very misleading in certain places as to what is required for growth in practive - healthwise, let alone its martial foundation, or even the core skills of Shisanshi (13 Forms/Methods) which are the foundation of all Taijiquan. This ones for the fringe element of the New Age fad."
__label__2,Enjoyable but not typical storyline for Debbie: I am trying to get to read all of Debbie Macomber's books and wanted to read this early product. I think her later books show she has found her voice and her fans. This seemed so unlike her that I had to keep checking to see if I had the right one. It is interesting to read it just for the purpose of comparison. It had more the romance outline of today that is really explicit. It had lots of twists that were imaginative and I am glad I read it.
__label__1,"its ok, not great.: This panda is very large. Larger than it looks in the picture. Takes up a lot of space. Many strings and threads are dangling off of the panda, which will eventually be a hole."
__label__1,"This was a bestseller?: Dawkins must not have been trying very hard in this one. A lot of different ideas - most of them repeats of stuff he's done before (and since) - the sort of thing he can apparently do without thinking too hard about it. If you've read Dawkins before, you'll know the sort of thing: natural selection, Argument from Personal Incredulity, etc. Okay, he has kind of linked everything to his title, the idea of humanity being a gene flow from our remotest ancestors, but it still has a sense of being cobbled together for a quick sale. His examples are mostly good ones, but so well known they're virtually cliches - Tinbergen's sticklebacks, von Frisch's bees, Fabre's hunting wasps. (What? No Lorenz-imprinted geese? Maybe he's keeping that for later.)He does have a facile style, and I must admit he had me smiling in a couple of places, particularly with the idea of God creating superbly adapted cheetahs and antelopes with the idea of maximising David Attenborough's ratings."
__label__1,"Basics of warfare for 12 year olds: Sun Tzu's the art of war is one of the most overrated books in terms of content. It is not that the writer is wrong about most subjects (though a lot is hopelessly outdated). The problem is that any 12 year old who has played with toy soldiers enough, could have written this book, without the fancy words or synonyms.Don't attack when outnumbered, with the sun in your face etc etc. The very basics of battles, not even of warfare. True warfare, now and then, relies more on logistics with the battles being just a small part of war.So if you are completely ignorant of battles and war and simple logic you can read this book and be satisfied. However if you are truely interested in the ""art of war"" then read the book with that same name from Machiavelli."
__label__2,"Love The Show: As far as I am concerned, this is the best show on TV. The set and costumes are so fantastic. I could just watch it to get ideas for modern living. Don Draper helps reel me in, too. The dvd set is good for true fans. A must have."
__label__1,"A doggie is nothing if he don't have a bone...whatever: This is possibly the most annoying song ever made. WHO LET THE DOGS OUT? WHO? WHO? WHO?, what kind of lyrics are that? The dog noises these guys make are really annoying too. No wonder it was their only hit (why was it even a hit? who knows). All that matters now is that the Baha Men are gone terrorizing us and they are pretty much forgotten. Why waste money on a full album of this crap anyway? Just stay away..."
__label__2,"Great guitar for the price: I bought the S35 for my son for Christmas. I was impressed with the appearance of the guitar and it has a great sound for the money. The action is a little high, but not hard to play. My son is a beginning guitar player and I am sure this instrument will last him many years. I have even considered buying another one for myself."
__label__2,"A Free New York Vacation, without leaving home!: Spiderman 2 is the best superhero game ever! I love web slinging from one part of the city to the other part of the city! Some things aren't as realistic as it's supposed to be, though. I'm talking about no big traffic on the streets and no big crowds in the sidewalks. It would be cool if crowds cheer for you, instead of one or two people cheering for you. I wish you can go Inside OSCORP and the Empire State Building and other skyscrapers and you can go everywhere in those skyscrapers, but technology isn't that advanced yet, so when Spidey 3 comes out, i hope these new features would be available!"

__label__1,"Uniden has history of ""dying"" handsets: I used to be a fan of Uniden, having purchased several of their 900 Mhz models in the last few years. Unfortunately, I feel compelled to report that a high percentage of them (about a third, in my experience) have failed (""died"") within a two year period. Replacing the battery only works temporarily, as the problem appears to be related to the charging mechanism. They must continue to use similar internal components, because the problem persists in current models. Although I like the functionality of the Uniden phones, I can neither recommend them to others nor continue to purchase them for myself because of their high failure rate."
__label__1,"Ticking time bomb: I was very happy with this product (for the first 9 months). It cleans easily and is very flexible. But it suddenly started leaking so badly it sprays up the wall and we can't use the shower until we replace it. No response back from the seller, either. The hose I had before lasted for more than 5 years, and I only replaced it because I couldn't get it clean. Bummer! Hope I can find something fast . . . my co-workers are starting to complain."
__label__2,"Good Rock: This album by Isle of Q can be described simply as straight up rock. I even think I heard some quitar solos. Good lyrics and good music, makes for a darn good CD. Standout tracks include ""The Clone"", ""Sweet Potato"", and ""Hideaway"". If you happen to like Isle of Q check out the band Dust For Life, or vice versa. They have similar sounds and are both good live."

__label__1,"One of most over-hyped recent books I've read: Being both a history and fiction fan, the title of this book alone attracted me. When I learned it had to do with Dracula, it attracted me even more. I just finished reading it and what a disappointment it was. First, this book is too long by some 200-250 pages. By the time I got to the end, I had forgotten how the whole thing started. The going back and forth between letters and present and more letters was interesting at the beginning but just grew cumbersome. I realize this is fiction, but the best works of fiction (in my opinion) are those with stories that are so well-developed that they could be real. Not that I'd believe Dracula is around somewhere, but the coincidences and ""chance meetings"" that occur in this book are just plain cheesy.You want to be gripped, spooked out of your wits and sleep with the lights on? Read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula""."
__label__1,"Can't believe this still has a decent rating... it shouldn't!: Nobody wants to have a backup device they can't trust. The issues people are reporting are real. Avoid this product. The static switch stops working. The eSata is a nice feature, but they need to document the trade-offs to using it. You really need to have AHCI or RAID, the Intel Matrix Storage Manager, installed BEFORE you install the OS. You will have to re-install the OS if you want this device to work using eSata. This is due to the fact that eSata doesn't support hot-swapping (or unplugging) like a USB external hard drive does. If you want to turn the device on and use it, turn it off and then unplug it using eSata, you MUST reinstall the OS with the AHCI or RAID option (in your BIOS) turned on. Otherwise the unit is ""always on"" and cannot be turned off (it refuses to be be turned off by the switch). It gets really hot!"
__label__2,Wonderful: After 4 weeks of no sleep - we realized Lucas liked to sleep on his belly. He slept for 5 straight hours on his stomach (during the day while I watched)when we finally caught on. Everytime he was layed on his back he woke up within minutes. I bought this on line after a friend told me about it. It has been wonderful. I no longer worry about laying him down and would definately suggest this to everyone with a newborn. The only time the alarm has gone off is when we forget to shut it off after picking Lucas up.

This should never have gone to market in its' present state. It should have either been a free download OR edited properly."
__label__2,"Great detective story!: The ""Prey"" series is one of my favorite.Sandford creates some really great characters in this series and one great detective in Lucas Davenport.The stories are always gripping and believable. The action is fast paced and nerve racking.Most importantly, unlike so many other detective novel series by other other authors, the ending doesn't cheat the reader.Start with the first book in this series and work your way through - you won't be disappointed."

__label__2,"my wife loves it: She loves the way it smells, and it also actually works better as a shave gel than any other I've tried. My only minor kvetch is that sometimes it hardens into rubber-cement-like goo around the spout and you have to clear that away before using it. But that's not really a hardship."
__label__1,"Eye candy and nothing else: The film is cinematically gorgeous but way too unbelievable to be enjoyable. If I wanted to imagine a dark near future scenario, I could have done way better than this.Ultraviolet is a film about a babe who is also a killing machine. She lives in a fantasy ""near-future"" world run by a technocratic pseudopriest and divided between humans and those infected with an unbelievable virus that has turned them into superstrong, superfast ""vampires.""I had a hard time not falling asleep because the entire premise of the movie is silly and the action is so over the top it bored me. The only thing that kept me awake and paying marginal attention is Milla Jovovich.The only reason I can see to watch the movie is if you're obssessed with her. I'm not, but she kept my attention on the screen - barely."
__label__2,"Davenport Does It Again!!: I like John Sanford, and I like his character Lucas Davenport. Davenport is definitely a womanizer, but he is also a ruthless sleuth. And, he will do anything to save a threatened victim. This novel follows the usual format, but with its own twists and turns, circumstances, etc. I like it. I have trouble putting the book down so that I can go to work (how dare work interfere?). I highly recommend John Sandford and his work."
__label__1,"blu-ray: I am beginning to get blu-ray, INSTEAD OF WHAT I HAD ORDERED.. I want DVD, so I will be returning the merchandise.I do not own a Blu-Ray machine."
__label__1,Do not Buy: This is the worst dvd I have ever bought. The girls are all ugly and gross and the footage is terrible. Do not buy ths dvd!
__label__1,cheap: this so called hotel is c-h-e-a-pit doesn't have steps or an elevatorit's small an not fun.the shop onlyhas a few accsories.the rollercosteris noisy and short.it is a whole bunchof crappy stuff. polly get some real hairand better playsets.
__label__1,"Not too impressed...: As a woman who made a conscious decision to become a single parent, I found this book very elementary. It did not give me any solid, new information about how to get by on a day to day basis. I think it would be much more helpful for those who find themselves single parents and are not happy about it. It was nicely written and I got a kick out of a few sections. I could have gotten enough out of it by skimming through in a book store."
__label__2,Almost: Almost exaclty what I wanted. Had I taken the time to actually measuer things up I would have realized that this handle is a bit long for standard sized woks (used in a home). It's more for restaurant sized woks. Get the one with the shorter handle. The metal is sturdy and the wooden handle you simply push into the metal handle. Good enough!
__label__1,"Very Bad: Other than some nice photographs of Hogan, this book has little to offer. Just another case of an author exploiting the name of a great athlete. Isn't this the same author who twice used Tiger Woods' name on the cover of books that the golfer had nothing to do with? If the author knows so much about the swings of Woods and Hogan, why doesn't he put that knowledge to use on the course? This book is a stinker."
__label__1,A rip-off: This book rips off Tolkien's name. It is got up to look as if it is writen BY Tolkien. In fact it is a collection of largely poorly-written and factually incorrect articles by minor academics.
__label__1,Expensive leaky bottles!!: These bottles are the worst. All they do it leak all the time. I tried everything the company told me to do to stop the leaking but nothing has helped. They even sent me new bottles and I shipped the old ones back but the new ones leak too. Went to the cheap evenflo bottles for 3 bucks and they are soooo much better. Don't waste you time or money on the hype that surrounds these bottles. IT is not worth it! Save your $$
__label__2,"Kal Jerico at your service: The authors did a great job of translating the characters from the comic book page into prose form. Everything that is in the comic book adventures of Jerico is all here in great detail; even his CyberMastiff, Wotan. Excellent mix of just enough politcal manovering and gunslinging action that keeps the story rolling along without any dead spots or forced occurences. If I had to say something bad about it, there would only be one thing that you could force out of me and that would be the cliche name of one of the characters; you'll know who as soon as you read it.If you are even remotely interested...pick this book up. You won't regret it."
__label__1,NOT AS PICTURED- BEWARE!: The item received is NOTHING LIKE WHAT IS PICTURED! Ordered the Coleman (4 of them!) and got Woods brand which features a protective ridge where the plug would go and 3-plug adaptors cannot be used. Returning these as I own the one pictured and this is not it. 5-stars for the Coleman one pictured and 2-star for the Woods model received because of the ridge.
__label__2,"My personal favorite BR album: Although few people will probably agree with me, this is by far my favorite Bad Religion album. I have been a fan of them since I was 15, and they have been my favorite band for over 10 years. I have owned all of the albums, and I appreciate them all, but when I finally found this one among some other neglected cds, I was ecstatic. Recipe for Hate is so deep and it really makes me emote. I love the different sounds on this record - some twangs of country, the military sound on ""all good soliders"", and the smooth melodies on skyscraper - and I just love belting the songs out as loudly as I can on the way to work. It really pumps me up. Conversely, my 2 year old daughter loves when I sing the songs slowly, especially Skyscraper, my favorite song from the album, to her when I put her to bed. [...]."
__label__2,"Time travel romance.....: I love these books by Karen Marie Moning. Circenn is truly a sexy, masculine hero. Well worth a read. He crosses the barriers of time to rescue Lisa from her fate.Beautiful. :)"
__label__1,"Really Three Views: As other reviews have noted, the main disappointment here is that this book summarily dismisses historicism, which is a mainstay on any scholarly list of the four systems of interpretation.Although it is true that historicism is no longer a popular view, it deserves full treatment for three reasons. First, historicism was the predominant protestant view for three or more centuries and should be include for completeness. Second, historicist are producing many books in response to the futurism of ""Left Behind"", making readers curious to know how these views fit in. Finally, it is not inconceivable that the ultimate truth will include some elements from each of the four camps, so one should be well-versed in all four views.I certainly hope that the next version includes historicism, as well as the counter-point format."
__label__2,Super CUTE: This outfit is perfect for my 5 month old! She looks SO cute in it and it's not too thick for those of us that live in warmer climates and can be put over long sleeves to dress warm!
__label__1,"Beware! This page refers to the Muir translation: The reviews on this page refer to the newest edition and translation of The Castle, but the publication being advertised on this page is the old, error-filled Muir translation. Look inside the book and check the copyright information to avoid ordering by error. I made the mistake of ordering from this page and received the Muir translation, which I already had in an older printing."
__label__1,"How about a little respect??: I agree with the previous reviewer. The husband really has no respect for culture. The wife is wayyy too good for this guy! Unfortunately, he's the father of a beautiful baby girl. Let's hope she can help him grow up!!! The book really didn't provide any new information or insights to China adoption. I read the below reviews and bought it anyway. Anyone want to buy my copy now? I love to keep my books but it's just not one I would read again since it's mostly written with disregard for his daughters wonderful culture. Sad."
__label__2,"Very well made documentrary about popular modern day cult: Temple of the Godmakers II, produced by'Saints Alive in Christ' with JeremiahFilms, is now on DVD but none is curre-ntly being sold threw ecom, so I haveto place this review on the VHS side ofthe products. Get this on either formatif you can, Mr. and Mrs. America. Try toget anyone you know out of this cult. Theadmissions of the Mormons in here are en-ough to convince me of how brainwashedthey are."
__label__1,"don't buy this product from alternate new and used sources!!: I have used this product and been very happy in the past. I gave my set away and wanted to replace it, so visited the ecom site. My mistake was ordering from another source through ecom, and although they show the product description as same with ""2 miracle balls included"", only a book arrived. I can tell you that you do not get the same results rolling around on the book. The 2 small balls make all the difference. Be sure that the product description is accurate. I was told by seller that they would not accept return."
__label__1,"Disappointing!!: Ms. Roberts did a poor job on this book. I was literally going to sleep reading the book. Considering Kate is very similar to Taming Natasha. The plot was incredibly BORING. However, I enjoyed Ms. Roberts' other Stanislaski books, ""The Stanislaski Brothers and The Stanislaski Sisters"". Ms. Roberts' writing style is very excellent however, her story plots are becoming very similiar."
__label__2,"Cunningham's Companion: While the actual list of plants and herbs is not as extensive as Cunningham's, I always use this book as a cross-reference. There is additional helpful information such as each herbs own recipe and incredibly valuable tables for increasing / decreasing amounts. The lists of associations are handy for double-checking what feels right to use. I also appreciate the inclusion of scent descriptions which saves a learning the hard way when making incense."
__label__1,This book is dangerous nonsense!: As a result of reading this book I went to a clinical ecoligist in New York City. He was affiliated with a major upper east side hopital so I felt he should be legitimate. He gave me dilutions of chemicals including formaldehyde both by intradermal injection and sublingualy. After 3 month of this treatment my I could no longer work my blood test doubled in the allergic indicater Ige ( the highest any allergist I seen has ever encounter). I found out from the Office of professional medical conduct and the FDA that clinical ecology is quackery. In forty years these guys have been unable to show one double blind study proving the effacy of their treatment. The quack who teated me is currently under investigation. Before you try any of this nonsense I strongly urg you to check with the FDA or your local Health Department.
__label__2,fit's fine: The fit is perfect. It was easy to install and looks great. The only reason for 4 stars is that when pulling it tight there was a small tear. It may be a little cheap but it looks fine.
__label__2,"This book is an excellent research resource.: After researching for years and looking desperately for a good resource on Women in the Celtic times, this book was an amazing find. I was thrilled by the information I found here. I learned things about Celtic Women that I had never imagined could be true. I know that I will be using this book for many years to come."
__label__1,This is not a real GI Poncho: Save your money and get a real poncho. This is not the same style or quality as an original. very misleading. i wouldnt buy another one for $2!
__label__2,"Well Done, Easy to Follow and Play Rock Sampler: First the quality: very good, with chord diagrams, notation and tabulature. It's a clear and easy way to learn the songs. Lyrics are easy to find, though small. It is an eclectic sampler of every decade of rock since the 50's including Fats Domino, Korn, Van Halen, the Eagles, Pantera, Don McLean and Sheryl Crow. Really good songs cover most rock styles...and that's where it shines."
__label__1,"Don't Bother: I bought this device locally (in Australia) and it is a pile of @#!& having used it for around 3 months it has completely failed.- The Raid 1 functionality is useless as you cannot recover the data without having another Maxtor device- It disappears from the network every day- It is very slow- Maxtor (Seagate) service is rubbish, they'll replace the brand new drive with a second hand unit, only after you send them your existing drive. You have no way of scrubbing or recovering your drive without using a very expensive third party service.My advice is to BACK UP everything and stick your drive on eBay. Get a PC for less than $500 and use that for storage."
__label__1,"High shipping: Shipping was very prompt, it took 2 days to receive the items. I use these to make oil lamps out of wine bottles and these wicks are very short for this. Also the shipping rate was very high, I bought a gallon of lamp oil elsewhere for about the same shipping rate."
__label__2,"The best thing since sliced bread!: I have had kindle envy since the fall of 2008 when my bff got one. I ordered one for myself but, of course, it was out of stock until Feb. 2009. Just as well because now I own a Kindle 2 and I love it. The ability to keep my audio and written books all in one place is priceless. When I am done with one book I don't have to wait until I have time to go to costco or the book store. In less than 1 minute I can be reading a new bestseller! All in all it is a wonderful thing! Only complaint...I used to enjoy passing on my favorite books to friends. Now I can only recommend that they go out and get them theirselves!!"
__label__2,"Awesome Access Point with 802.11g speeds: This AP has some good quality features. Filtering, WEP, soon WPA, and more. I have this plugged into my 4 port router and now I can access the Internet with my laptop and DWL-G650 (wireless adapter for laptop). These two products give me great range (throughout the house, and even outside), good security, and a reliable wireless connection. This is all I need for a small price."
__label__1,Ridiculous pricing: Two stars for pricing. $160? F that. I'd be more willing to pay $100 considering you can pick up to season ten on DVD for almost as much. Retarded
__label__1,"Not Dishwasher or Stovetop Safe: I just bought this set and was dismayed to note in the ""Important Safety, Use & Care Information"" that the set is not dishwasher safe and is not recommended for use on Ceramic/Glass Stovetops."
__label__2,"Now at last they were beginning Chapter One...: This book is the last volume in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series. The last King of Narnia fights a hopeless battle against evil yet finds glory. He discovers that reality and Narnia itself are mere ""Shadow-Lands"" which only mimic a truer place. A beautiful and spiritual novel, it should always be read last in the sequence of Narnia stories."
__label__1,"Completely disappointing!: Pride and Prejudice is my absolute favorite book. Therefore, I read all the sequels to PnP. This one is without a doubt one of the worst if not THE worst. Incidentally, this was the first sequel I had ever read and was so upset after I read it that I was apprehensive to read any others. Thankfully, I have read sequels since that are much better. The author's portrayals of the Darcys and the Bingleys are so off that it is disturbing. It makes me wonder if she even read PnP. Through about two-thirds of the book, it is also incredibly boring. As if she wrote the last third in a hurry, Tennant crams in so much ridiculous nonsense to end the book. Since I can't let myself not finish a book once I start, I was happy when I finally got to the end and the misery was over."
__label__2,"Ken Burns' Civil War Documentary is an American Classic: Ken Burns' Civil War Documentary is an absolute American classic. I remember seeing it on TV when it first appeared on PBS in 1990 or so. However, the new updated version is even better due to the improved sounds and visuals. Now we can enjoy it at our leisure due to the new DVD set.I highly recommend this DVD set for any history buff. It's unique format of celebrities narrating the quotes of our ancestors from the Civil War era is a delight."
__label__2,Good Printer: Good printer - Have not tested all features yet but so far so good. Using this on a wired network running XP and Ubuntu. Fast shipping and good price from ecom. Would buy this again if needed.
__label__1,"So disappointed.: After reading Philippa Gregory's entire line of historical novels surrounding English royalty, I enthusiastically picked up The Wise Women. Not a good move. While Gregory is a masterful story teller, this particular story is twisted and dark and sometimes nauseatingly obscene, and I was very disappointed. Various strings of the story were never even resolved by the end of the story (what happened to the wax dolls?). And I hated the very ending...it did not redeem Alys in my eyes and seemed an impetuous move on her part, not true repentance. Many of Phillipa Gregory's characters have both good and evil qualities (Anne Boleyn), and I love that. No matter their faults, I sympathize with them. But I found nothing in her capricious character Alys I could identify or sympathize with. So sorry I read this."
__label__1,"Interesting premise falls short in execution: This book held my attention until around page 100. Until then, it was an intersting, somewhat plausible story, but once it got into talking dogs and the experiments on them, I thought, ""This is too ridiculous!"" It wasn't the concept so much as its execution. I almost gave up, but plodded through the next 30 pages or so, and then finished it because I wanted to see how it came out. This book got a lot of hype (which is why I got it), but I don't know why. It's mediocre, though a quick read. I did like how Parkhurst went back and forth, one chapter in the present, the next chapter in the past, and so on."
__label__1,"Maybe the worst travel book ever!: Totally disorganized. If you want to travel in Brisbane, you have to look in 6 different sections to get all the different information about Brisbane. The walking tour on pp 228-229 has each of the places numbered and refers to a map on page 102 that has no numbers. And doesn't even show all the places listed in the walking tour. No legend on the map so you have to ""know"" that the red dots are Queensland Railway stations. Save your money and frustration. Do not buy this book."
__label__1,"Picture is dim and screws didn't fit: Bought 2 of these back in November to install in our TV, thinking I could save some money over the $150+ JVC brand. We just got around to installing one. First problem: the screws in the external plastic housing would NOT screw into our TV. We had to delicately remove the screws in the old housing and use those with the new bulb. Second problem: When we finally got the new bulb installed and turned on the TV, it took FOREVER to warm up and show a picture. Easily three times as long as the JVC bulb. Last but not least, once the bulb finally warms up, the picture is not nearly as bright as a new JVC bulb. I adjusted the brightness to the highest setting, and it is about the same brightness as the 4-year-old JVC bulb we were trying to replace. Unfortunately we missed our return window and now I am stuck with this bad bulb and an unopened second replacement bulb. Guess I'll stick to the brand name next time."
__label__2,"New Consumer Reports Subscription: I've now gotten my second issue of Consumer Reports through my ecom purchase - it started really quickly after placing the order, so that in itself was a nice surprise. I'm not a magazine fan at all, but product info and ratings has become so complicated and confusing I thought I'd give it a try. This publication covers a huge scope of products and services, so it goes from the teetch-clenching decision-making on major purchases right down to daily products off the grocery store shelf. I'm glad I've started this subscription and recommend it highly."
__label__1,small can: Beware this is the smallest can of tire foam I have ever seen. For the price it should be a reg size can.
__label__2,Very helpful & thorough: This book is great as a reference for people who have the disease and also as a tool for those who are looking for a diagnosis. The author is considered to be the authority on the disease and it's nice to have a place to go to for correct information. There is much misinformation out there and this book dispels the myths.
__label__1,Really two and a half stars: This thing does the job. But people are going way too crazy with the 5 star reviews. I know most people only feel the need to write a review for something they give either 5 or one star(s). But come on. This is a typical popcorn popper. It pops. Leaves an average amount of corns un-popped (yes I have used the good stuff) and does its job as well (or poorly) as every other popcorn maker on the market. One reviewer noted that the stirring rod removed the non-stick coating where it rubs and this is true. Silly that it's designed that way.
__label__2,Very interesting and lots of fun.: I recently purchased Kokology and was planning on using it at a small get together with friends but it was so interesting I ended up doing a third of the scenarios with my boyfriend. It was a lot of fun to discover what made each other tick.I would highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to get to know someone better or just having a laugh over the outcomes of these mini personality tests.This book would provide a lot of entertainment on long drives. It will keep the driver and passengers very entertained. But I wouldn't recommend this book to be read to children. Some of the test questions and scenarios seem very innocent but when you read the outcome they are adult in nature...
__label__1,"If you like the smell of pot, maybe...: I'm really not sure what I expected with these ""herbal"" cigarettes, but whatever it was, it certainly wasn't what I ended up getting. I did expect them to be different from a normal cigarette, yes, but I didn't foresee them smelling like weed. The taste was (to me) also horrible. Not to mention, after a couple puffs I ended up with a major headache. I love the idea of something like this and I really did want to like them. However, given my experience with these, I'd much rather just keep smoking until I muster up the willpower to quit on my own."
__label__1,Too scripted.: it started out as a good concept. but now it has become way to scripted and predictable that it has lost its appeal.
__label__2,Just like the Doctor's office.: The scale arrived in perfect condition. Assembly took about 5 minutes with no problems at all. We are finally able to know what we weigh without worrying about whether the batteries are low or we are standing in the same place. This is a great product!
__label__2,"fantastic performances and sound quality at a great price!: These performances by the Suk Trio are considered by many to be the definitive versions of the Dvorak trios. The recording quality is absolutely wonderful (digitally remastered analog recordings from the late 70s). Packaging is attractive, notes are informative, and the price is amazing for this benchmark 2CD set. Don't pass this one up!"
__label__2,"The younger Michael is just as good as the older: While most Michael fans like his more grown up voice, I prefer his younger voice. I bought this album back in 2002 not knowing any song on it. I just wanted to take a chance and I fell in love. His voice is just as powerful like his current and Michael just sings to you from his heart. My favorite song off the album is ""Wings Of My Love"" because I love the music in the back ground and Michael sings it to make you feel like he is takeing you high on the wings of his love. Every Mike fan must own his albums from his J5 and Motown solo days before they can own his stuff from the 80s. Michael will forever have me stuck on this album."
__label__2,"Best of the Best: I'm an amature woodworker who builds mostly furniture items. I've owned high-end orbital jigsaws from both Dewalt and Porter Cable. Both were fine saws and I was very happy with them until I got my hands on a Bosch. Everything about this saw pleases me. It's plenty powerful enough to cut 2X framing lumber when needed. The blade change mechanism is tool-less, quick and easy on the fingers. It's the smoothest operating saw I've used, and I thought the others were good. But one of the most helpful features is that it's designed so it doesn't blow sawdust up into my eyes when I sight down the blade to the cut line. It's truly a fine piece of machinery and a joy to use."
__label__1,"it doesn't know weather it wants to be a comedy or a drama: The acting was wooden. The direction seemed nearly non existent, or at the very last seriously flawed. The romatic lead (Shemar whatshisface) is a soap opera actor, chosen for his puppy dog glances, not his acting. He was perfectly cast. If you like black cinema's you will be dissapointed by this movie. The flick misses on all counts."
__label__1,NO CC FOR HEARING IMPAIRED: WHY WOULD A 1980 MOVIE NOT HAVE CLOSED CAPTION? GREAT CASTAND SUBJECT BUT JUST LOOKING AT IT ISN'T THE SAME.HOW DISAPPOINTING.
__label__2,"Monster Cable iCarPlay Wireless: I recently purchased the Monster Cable iCarPlay so that I could listen to my ipod in the car. I am very satisfied with this product. The sound quality is clear with little interference as long as you choose an open radio station to broadcast through. Unlike the iTrip, it is easy to work and it charges the ipod while you are using it. I would highly recommend this product."
__label__2,Campbell knows how to write: I always recommend Ramsey Campbell's books. He puts a lot of psychology into them and they aren't just derivative potboilers.
__label__2,"Simply....The Best!: Of all the DVD burners out there,this is the best. Have burned over 60 DVD's without one coaster. Multiple format proves invaluable. Spend the extra $$$ you'll make it up in the end by not wasting time and ruined DVD software."
__label__2,"The great JB!: Some points:Someone said the band was much better (than today's Soul Generals?) I strongly dsiagree. While they are good, I feel that his current band is his best and tightest ever. Also, the bonus tracks promised are on the PAL European editions.It really is a shame that ecom didn't check this out before falsely, albeit I'm sure unintentionally, advertising those tracks. The DVD is fantastic. TOO FUNKY has a guitar riff in it I have never heard before. The only drawback is, as usual, the stupid cameraman cuts to one of the band members just as Mr. Brown starts to do the mashed potatoes during 'Papa's Got A Brand New Bag'. This has happened to some degree in almost every concert James Brown video I have!! Most aggravating. Another somewhat annoying observation: the beginning song is RAPP PAYBACK, from 1980, not the original PAYBACK from 1974.In the middle of the song, James goes into THE PAYBACK. How hard is it to do a bit of research before releasing a DVD??"
__label__2,"Great pre-war biography: While this biography may lack sufficient depth in parts, it's an excellent examination of FDR's efforts to bring us into WWII. FDR knew we had to fight and, with extraordinary effort, prepared the US even though many: Father Coughlin (the Rush Limbaugh of his day); General Wood; Charles Lindberg; Henry Ford; and many others were fighting against it.It also puts to rest the idea that FDR knew about the Pearl Harbor attach in advance.For these reasons, I recommend it."
__label__2,"Great book for every pregnant woman: I really loved this book-- it was a nice change from the typical pregnancy books out there. It shared useful information, while incorporating real women, faith and humor!"
__label__2,"Follow that painting!: Vreeland does a wonderful job with this book, which follows the life of a painting, from the present day back to its creation. The style of the story is reminiscent (albeit in reverse chronology) of the movie Tales of Manhattan (Ginger Rogers, Cesar Romero, you remember), which follows a tail coat through its remarkably adventurous life. What makes such a journey insteresting is the way the painting is bound inextricably to the scandals, loves, secrets, and desires of the characters who, at various times, own it. Reading the frankly personal chapters, I almost felt like a private eye, tracing the painting's history and linking the characters together.While Vreeland doesn't claim to be an art expert, she does a wonderful job describing the nuances of the painting, and she clearly has admiration for the craft of the artist. I very much enjoyed this book, and it reads surprisingly quickly. You can easily finish it in one or two sittings. A real gem."
__label__1,"You get what you pay for.: This feeder did not even last a week. It only lasted about three days. The squirrels knocked it off the tree and knawed off the plastic handle. It is now sitting in the recycle bin. I did not expect this feeder to last long, but hoped it would last at least a few months. If you live in an area heavily populated with squirrels, I advise you not to buy this feeder."
__label__2,"Excitement and Fun: I couldn't put this book down. My favorite of Neville's three, and I've read them all. Some may find it too non-cerebral for their taste, but it just shows she can write anything, including John Grisham style stuff. With romance, no less!"
__label__2,The Little prince: The Complex and Simple issues of the Human relation in a Book For Children. You Must find it
__label__2,"My favorite 'new' band: A friend of mine dragged me to the Wrens show in Chicago a few weeks ago. I walked in non-commital and by the end of the night emerged a true believer. I bought the disc the next day and haven't bothered to listen to much else since. Most of the obvious comparisons have already been made by other reviewers but are ultimately beside the point. These guys are the real deal. I love the emotional directness and vulnerabiltiy that emerges even in the harder rocking songs, esp. ""Hopeless"" which is worth the price of admission alone. Great CD, great band."
__label__2,"A Deadly Game: This is a terrific book to read. It makes you feel as though you were a part of the investigation and really gives great detail. Another one which is a must read is ""For Laci"" What an incredible tribute to her daughter."
__label__1,"NOT Pink Floyd....: I don't get it. These guys are not THAT good! Other than the song ""Clocks"", I have a difficult time finding anything on this CD that is memorable. I do have to hand it to the band - they did keep this album simple and it is not the same over-processed garbage that the music industry is putting out, but this band is not ""there"" yet. But this album does not compare to anything Pink Floyd has done."
__label__2,"Great book!: This is a very good book with lots of detail,for anyone who is going to build a cob house or if you are just curious about this type of art work.Happy cobbing."
__label__1,These Stink!: They crackled and peeled after the first washing. Very poor product. Only good for one time wear-iron-on shirts. Very disappointed.
__label__1,"Not Accurate - Ganes Time: I bought one of these clocks several months ago because it had a big display. That clock gained about 5 minutes during the first week so I took it back and got a replacement. This one is better, it only gains about 1 minute a week. Sharp guarantee is no good, you have to send them in a payment of about what the clock initally costs (for shipping and handling) plus your costs for shipping it to them. Guarantee is worthless, clock not much better."
__label__2,"Finally Available if only digitally!!!: I'm so glad this album is finally available in it's original form after all these years! I first bought this record after seeing the band play at my high school in New Hartford NY right after this was released. They played every song they knew - and then did an extended encore of Beatles covers after that!! The show lasted for FOUR hours. Not bad for a 13 year old's first concert!!!!This album is really for someone who likes Orlean's hits, but wants to dig a little deeper. Every song has it's merit - my favorite has always been ""Your Life My Friend"" as well as ""Fresh Wind"". Of course ""Dance With Me"" is practially a classic in it's own right. Also, check out ""Time Passes On"" - a really beautiful song.Overall this is a great album - these guys could really write great hooks, and the guitar playing is very good as well. Really worth the Nine bucks to get this long out of print gem."

The stupid twist at the end wasn't even exciting. Still didn't care. If you want to read a good EJD book, read ""The Other Woman."""
__label__1,"This is an extremely small turntable: I was looking for a tilting turntable for cake decorating. This will work fine for 8 inch or smaller cakes, which cake decorators rarely make, but I have doubts about larger cakes like 14 inch. A two layer 14 inch cake is pretty heavy. The seller tells the diameter in the description and there is a 20% restocking fee plus buyer pays return shipping so it's not really worth returning if you don't like it. So don't buy it if you are looking for something to do stringwork on a wedding cake. I just think it's too small. Since most cake decorating turntables are 12 inches, I just assumed this one was too. It is made of plastic as well but the photo looks like a heavy duty steel. Don't just look at the picture like I did. Read the description before you buy.."

__label__2,"Straighforward but Unrefined: Nicol Matt conducts Mass No.1, Helmut Rillin conducts the rest of the works. I find that Mass No. 1, Psalm 150 and the Te Deum are the most successful of the set.The sound quality of Rilling's recordings are wide but somewhat muddy, unrefined, and unclear. The set provides a resonable and inexpensive way to learn and appreciate Bruckner's Choral works.(I find that Jochum's readings of the Masses are a little to clear and refined and emotionally held back...his Te Deum on the other hand is the greatest on disc. My favorite Bruckner Choral set is still the Matthew Best set on Hyperion.)"

__label__2,"Rank Cologne's take: Woah. SLOW DOWN!!! Everbody RELAX! I've read this book and enjoyed it, but five frickin' stars across the board? That would make it an instant classic. This is not The Great Gatsby. This is a very well-written, entertaining mystery novel.I'd say the thing I enjoyed most about it is the writer's style...a nice rhythm to his sentences. Another thing that struck me was the descriptions of landscape. I get the feeling that if Johnson wrote a nonfiction nature book it would be something special. Why I wouldn't give this book five stars, besides that it's not The Great Gatsby, is that some of the humor falls flat to me. Some of it is spot on. But that said, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a high-quality novel who is not looking for a book that's going to change their life. Johnson is the real thing... looking foward to his next book."
__label__2,"Master Loves the Precious!!!!: This is a fantastic cd. It has all the great music from the movie, except for a few pieces, but all in all, I'd say it is worth the cash.

Ahhhhh, the preciousness of this cd is a worthy purchase. Just make sure you get the Original Soundtrack and not that other ... Lord of the Rings cd, it is not worth the plastic it's burned on."

It never really held a great charge, and within about six months of owning it, I was really irritated that I had purchased it.

When I got the dvd in the mail and opened it, the disk was cracked, I was heartbroken. I went online and ecom sent me a new dvd before I even returned the broken one!! I was so excited. As long as you send the return in by a certain date, you won't get charged for both - truly a no hassle return and exchange.

In June, 2009 the sensor feature failed causing sparks and loud grinding noises to emanate from the oven. I located Sharp repair services on the internet and called the listed number to obtain service. Unfortunately, I did not ask if the location listed on Sharp's website was accurate. I took the oven to the listed location only to find a vacant residential house. I then went to hhgregg where the original purchase was made and after a lengthy wait an hhgregg ""manager"" begrudgingly provided me with a 800 number that led to a repair service in a city some 240 miles from my location.

__label__1,"Not the best of books: I am a HUGE lover of any romance that is set in this time period, especially in Scotland. Yes, the premise of this book sounds intriguing, something new. But I swear, you'll have reached page 100 and STILL nothing has happened. I for one, did not find the hero of this book, heroic. He goes through HORRIBLE torture and he just shrugs it off?Our heroine capitulates back and forth, back and forth ad naseum about ""what to do""! You'll find yourself wanting to scream at the lovely female chieftan ""JUST DO IT ALREADY!""I consider myself more than an avid reader of this genre and this book just didn't do it for me. I will give the author kudos on being able to write exceptionally well scenes and dialoge. She weaves her tale and the feel of the story with an expert pen. However, the story drags in places where it should speed up.If you're into such stories, I suggest Marsha Canham, Virginia Henley and Karen Marie Moning."

Not even Moore could manipulate this book to make it full of lies, like he has done with everything else."
__label__2,"Balancing out: It looks like several reviewers saw this book on the ""New This Month"" list and decided to give it one star simply because they dislike the man, without looking at the book itself. So, in order to balance things out, I'm giving it five stars without looking at it. Isn't democracy great?"

It is not so hard to make trackballs that work well for both sides.Apparently the Logitech marketing department must think that left-handed people must love wires, since all their wireless trackballs are for right-handed people only.

__label__1,"Basically a pulp romance novel: Big disappointment--this story is primarily based on the sexual coming of age of a weaver/spinner and her crossbow archer prince within a specific historical context. The spinning and weaving is mostly a framework to string the reader along through the detailed exposition of budding romance (including gratuitous sex scenes) and violent conflicts that mark their journey. As a spinner and weaver, I expected alot more exposition on textiles from this story. The conclusion is also sadly anticlimactic."

I thought it might be me, so after reading the user manual and following instructions to no avail, I talked to Garmin, and did as they suggested to charge it overnight. No joy. Unit still would not turn on without external power. So, I thought, maybe it's the unit that has a problem. I returned it and had ecom send another. Same problem, same effort to overcome, still no joy. Sent the second unit back for refund. I don't understand how this could happen. Either there is a secret about how to enable the battery, or the batteries they use are garbage. Either way, it's not good for Garmin, not good for ecom, and not good for me.

There is hardly an explanation for the disease and no one knows how to stop it. The biggest disease of all was this entire movie. I won't waste time saying it was gross, stupid and completely idiotic. But if you watch it there are two things you need: a barf bag and earplugs. Hey maybe you can take the disgusting parts before you can take the bad acting, so maybe you can do without the barf bag. If you can't find neither grab a hand of sleeping pills and hope for the best."

Some of these songs weren't singles, let alone hit. I'd back off this."
__label__1,"NOT Trance!: This album contains a series of ""ethnic"" music with ""new age"" overtones. Beautiful music for peace and relaxation, but I won't classify this as trance. I was disappointed with the content as it did not give me psychedelia I've wanted."

__label__1,"Terribly Derivative: I wonder what was going through BT's head when he made this horrible album. His first two albums IMA and ESCM were classics but Movement in Still Life is just the worst techno albums I have heard this year and as well as one of the worst albums in general this year. I get the impression on this cd that Brian was attempting to make that big breakthrough like Moby did with Play. Although Movement in Still Life is different to Play, the album lacks any charm and beauty and comes off rather derivative. The only songs I like on this cd is Mercury and Solace and Dreaming which is why I gave this cd two stars instead of one."
__label__2,"Innacurate history?...: This was the best film of the 90's. No other film captured so purely the emotion of this masterpiece. Action, Romance , Courage, Strength, and Scottish accents all wrapped up into one movie! Simply put, it's exceptional! For those who argue about the film's historical value. After Wallace was eliminated, who do you think noted these events into the annuls of history? Sorry but the common man was very much illiterate.

She's tormented by the death of her former lover for years.

But the price made me do it and I am happy I did. This CD had all the songs I needed to fill out my collection. The quality was not an issue at all. This is well worth the money, you will not be disappointed. This is a perfect addition to that EWF fan that wanted to grab a few songs on ITUNES, you can get this CD have everything you needed and more for the cost of a few songs on Itunes."

For 95 minutes you get to hang out and drink beer with a genuinely nice bunch of hapless middle-aged ""slackers"" as they set out to redeem their lives by making a porn film. Everything about this movie is perfect: great actors, including Jeff Bridges and a dozen familiar faces from tv and small films; a wholly original screenplay; and lots of sex and lots of nudity. Er, the audience never really SEES the sex and nudity, but the clever way the director suggests-without-showing this important plot element is, like the rest of the film, utterly charming. Call a few buddies, grab a bag of corn chips and a six-pack, kick off your flip-flops and watch ""The Amateurs"" as soon as you can!"

But don't worry all Coldplay hits are in here like ""Clocks"", ""Yellow"", ""The scientist"", ""in my place"",etc.The performance of Coldplay on stage is totally awesome and the documentary is interesting.

Listening to it, I get the feeling that both Ronnie Montrose and Denny Carmassi have lost the edge they once had. (Where are the killer drum riffs Carmassi was known for? He became a wimp all those years he wasted his time playing for Heart.) The quality of songwriting and playing just isn't there. Sad, really."

His theme throughout the book is that every design decision you make must be in the interest of helping to communicate information to the reader. His basic messages are: There are too many sites on the web that display distracting, if not confusing, visual elements on their pages. Learning the technical details of web page implementation is not enough. You must also understand how to effectively provide information to your site's visitors.As you progress through each chapter, he'll illustrate bad examples and then suggest improvements for them. Some very good examples of what he feels is effective design are also presented."
__label__1,"Disgusting: There was nothing in the heroine's character to make the reader want to identify with her -- or even have sympathy for her.

__label__1,"Buy it used, or save your money....: I only wish this were the masterpiece it could have been. A nice mastering of the original tapes would have been far, far better than this slightly thin re-recording of the originals. As another reviewer mentioned, the sound is far too clean as compared with the nice warm analog sound of the originals. The instrumentations are well done, but generally lacking any warmth or personality.Yes, I know many of you think that Wilson could gargle on tape and it would be a masterpiece, but his voice here does not compare with the originals, nor do you get the rest of the BBs. His voice here, as with the Pet Sounds Live, is sort of flat. It is better than on Pet Sounds Live, but still not where it needed to be to undertake this monster of a job.Basically, it is ok, but wait for a used copy and pick that up. You will undoubtedly spend more time listening to the more cohesive bootlegs than to this recording."

The ending was dismal. As a detective novel this book fails miserably. Trying to unravel the clues is useless. As a literary work, this also piece also fails. Although some characters are well developed, others are one dimensionally vilified and demonized."

__label__2,"So Easy to Use and So Poweful too!: I literally threw out our larger Hamilton Beach Food processor because the lid was so hard to get off, almost impossible. We downsized with a bit of apprehension to a 3 cup size and it's perfect! The first culinary delight I made was some ham salad, everything was processed quickly, quietly [not an issue at all] and evenly. Then of course onions, carrots, relish items, all made in short order. This is an awsome machine that we can easily get the lid on and off and processes powerfully without a problem. I am so thrilled with this machine. There is just the two of us now but we entertain alot. Also so easy to store. I only used a few speeds on the big processor so hitting pulse a few times isn't a big issue at all. We love this little giant!"
__label__1,"Not Happy with Purchase: I was expecting the button like the ""Staples"" button to simply say the ""BS"" phrase when you hit it...this one talks in a Texas accent and says all of these different phrases that I guess is funny, but this is not what I wanted and was not stated that it would have all of the phrases in the review. Definitely will not be purchasing or recommending this to anyone. The only thing I could do with it was use it in a white elephant gift at Christmas."
__label__1,"Do not waste your money on this book: I bought this book, completed my INS file, and here is my conclusion: this is a shameless attempt at exploiting the fear that people have of the INS. The process is fairly complex, and this book is supposed to help you; I found it completely useless.The forms included (and some are missing) can be obtained free of charge from the INS.The so-called ""instructions"" are nothing more than a word for word copy of the official INS instructions printed on the back of the forms! No attempt was made to make your job easier by deciphering the official INS jargon.The rest of the information included can be figured out fairly quickly using the internet or the yellow pages."
__label__2,"Nice sound quality, a little uncomfortable: I like this product for the sound quality and price. Since I'm short, the wires are a bit long and I'm not sure how to adjust them. Overall, they work well."
__label__1,"Movie great, delivery not...: The movie is fabulous, but this was supposed to be a Christmas gift to my nephew's family, along with other DVD's ordered via ecom -- which made promises about delivery within days. How long did it take them. ALMOST A MONTH!"
__label__1,"They want to charge for this stuff?: This is amateur video at it's worst. Highlights of the guides trip through New Zealand included actual footage of clouds that blocked the view of Mt. Cook. I would expect a real video montage of New Zealand would at least require the videographer to go back on a Sunny day so that they could splice in footage of the mountain.Our guides were also more focused on the cheap side of New Zealand. While I prefer to spend my money wisely and don't stay at high end establishments, I will say if I'm traveling to the other side of the world I'm not going to skip an attraction because there is a fee involved.Instead of spending your money on this video, just take some time to review other travelers logs of trips to New Zealand. You'll learn more and also get an idea of things you want to try and things you want to avoid. This video did none of that. If I had the time, I could have created a more meaningful video diary of my 3 week New Zealand trek."
__label__2,"Terrific!: This is a terrific book. It is a brisk read but multilayered with subtle metaphors and other literary devices. Umrigar does a great job showing the interactions and sometimes lack of interaction between several women of different backgrounds -- age, class, and ethnicity. Issues of abuse and dependency are beautifully illustrated. I also found the complexity surrounding the issue abortion to be handled deftly and sensitively. Bravo!"
__label__1,"never showed: I ordered this item back in september. I found it was being shipped then, it never arrived. I ordered dvd's from two different vendors, the other arrived. A few weeks after it should have arrived i recieve an email that i was got an email for the original amout refunded but im out the shipping. Never heard from the vendor. I would not recommend this seller"
__label__2,"daughter: This was the perfect gift for the Buffy collector. She is hard to buy for, and this made the perfect final touch to her Christmas."
__label__1,"SCAM! NOT ORGANIC AT ALL!!!: IF you read the ingredients you'll notice there are pthalates and paraben and dangerous artificial colors!!! HOW DO THEY GET AWAY WITH CALLING THEMSELVES ORGANIC?! ecom should be ashamed of themselves, supporting such a falsely advertised product! I would NOT use this on myself, but especially on my kids. TERRIBLE."
__label__1,This product sucks!!!!: Do not..I repeat... DO NOT waste your money on this thing..it is garbage!!!! you have to carry around a stack of batteries just to take more than 5 pictures. There is a delayed second flash so unless you tell everyone your taking pictures of to wait for both flashes your going to get a lot of blurry faces. The picture quality is disgusting and impossible to edit. You can't take any close up pictures with the flash on because all you would see is hair and eyes.. I recently used it at a wedding and tried to take decent pictures from 3 rows away but even that failed to produce anything nice. When I took some pictures outdoors everybody including the background was blue...please save your self the frustration and opt for a more better quality camera..
__label__2,"Good, stable bike rack.: This rack is stable once it's on correctly and has held three bikes on some very long (8 hour) drives. It does take a bit of work to get it on correctly and to insure that it is well tied down. Once it is on, we have no trouble with it. The bikes do bounce and make noise and it is a bit nerve racking because it sounds like they are going fall, but they don't. We kept going back to check on them on the first trip to make sure nothing was wrong, but they were on just as tight as when we placed them there. For the cost, this rack is just right."
__label__1,It only makes sense...: Well people the only thing I can say is if you want to get the complete series with the original music. You might as well buy the sets seperately. It only makes sense to do it that way. AND you will save some money doing it like that too!!
__label__1,"Wrestling to Keep Baby Upright: The sling option was nice for my newborn baby, but, as he got bigger I had to remove the sling because there was a big hump of plastic jabbing him in the back. Troubles started when he was an infant, his little body squirmed all over and I had to wrestle to keep his head up and not falling into the water and body from sliding.I would skip this tub and use bathe a newborn in the sink and then invest in a Primo tub. That is what I ended up buying and it is WONDERFUL."
__label__2,"best cd purchase i've made(3 years ago)still my favorite: I own three of elliot smith's cds. either/or, elliot smith, and figure eight. what is so great about my collection is that each cd has a certain mood to it. they're all different but definetly smith. the great thing about either/or is how it is just his voice and the acoustics. when you put your headphones on and just listen you can hear every little detail like when he takes a breath to start a new stanza. like you're right there. the music is personal. my favorite song is number 4 ""between the bars"". THEY ARE ALL GREAT! IF YOU LIKE LOW-KEY ACOUSTIC THIS IS FOR YOU. HOPE YOU APPRECIATE AND ENJOY AS MUCH AS I DO! ROCK ON!"

__label__1,Cyber home is a piece of (...)!!!: I have a cyberhome 712 personal dvd player. It is a piece of (...) and the company is also. Had the machine for less than a year and the hinges broke. We have probably used it 5 times and it fell apart. Sent it back to the company and I had to pay to have it fixed. evidently a year doesn't mean a year. hinges are not covered. Ignorant people in their customer service department and the warranty isn't worth the paper it is written on.
__label__2,"Poison 'n Roll: Man was I suprised when I got this CD. It rocks, and yes it may be their best album ever, sorry Cece. If you ever liked this band, get this now! I can not listen to it enough, the best songs on the cd (as if there were any bad ones) are ' Best Thing You Ever Had' ' Baby Gets Around A Bit' ' Sexual Thing' ' That's The Way I Like It' 'Tragically Unhip'........get this now and CRANK IT!"
__label__2,"Loved IT!: very sad in some places but definitely a very good read, I laughed and cried at this book, the writer hit a home run with this one. Excellent!"
__label__1,CCR at their worst: While John Fogerty was at the helm CCR sold record after record. They were at the top. That wasn't good enough for brother Tom who quits the band. Other members Doug Clifford and Stu Cook were busy yelling I can sing I can write songs. John gave in and said do it and more or less walked away from what he knew would be a disaster. And it was. Others that follow a genius might find they are better off in doing so. I gave this a big thumbs down when it first came out and still do.
__label__1,"Off To A Good Start But Soon Takes A Turn To Forgetable Nonesense: We streamed this a few nights ago. The movie starts out with a premise that's hard to buy into but the occassional good scare and production values keep your attention. However what seemed plausible and enjoyable to watch soon turns predictable - and it get worse. By the end of the film they're throwing anything and everything we've seen doxens of times before at the screen it's tiersome, repetative and nothing new nor fresh.Perfomances are forgettable at best. As I watched the film derail I spent more time looking at the clock than the screen."
__label__2,"Maximum Tension: First book I have read by Robert Crais, I was not disapointed. The tension and realism brought to his story was remarkable, I felt as though I was part of the negotiation team. Also his ploting with a few sub plots was quite outstanding. His bringing everything together was very nice. I will read more of his books."
__label__2,"Galaxy Primes: This is one of the best stories that E. E. ""Doc"" Smith had written. I always enjoy reading this story and look at it with new eyes each time I read it. It is engaging, thoughtful, well-written and fun to read. I will read it again and again."
__label__2,"Beautifully written: This is an amazing story of one of the ""odd balls"" in life. I actually laughed and cried as I followed the heroine through her trials of dealing with being different in a mainstream world."
__label__1,"OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I tried Remington razors (including the R-950) and they all left very irritating red marks on my neck. I did not push hard, and kept trying for 3 weeks. I am used to using electric razors and never had this issue. My skin is not that sensitive. I was on travel to Japan (live in Texas) and it was embarrasing to say the least, looking like that in meetings.I went back to the Norelco and the shave is just as close and no irritation at all. Perhaps it's due to their movable heads that move with the curvature of your face. (they say it's patented, not sure). Please learn from my mistake."
__label__2,Big hostas this year: I love this device. It has made it possible to have the biggest hostas that we have ever had by chadeing all the deer away. It's also a lot of laughfs when the neighbors walk bye it and get doused. I have had one for two years now and the only problem is that it needs a new battery every year. That is good I think. I purchased several for the neighbors and they all love them too.
__label__2,"Great concept, great price, mediocre quality: Great knife, designed for a specific application. The quality IS low, however it's not a tool that sees daily use to the cutting edge.So I don't really see this as a huge issue. I received my knife and straight out of the box, noticed there was a very poorly applied tdc logo, not going to change the way the knife functions for it's intended purpose, but it's definatley not something you want to show off. Everything else was as advertised. Good coating, solid well secured grip panels, nice sharp edge and a well designed belt clip. It's been carried weakside for 2 weeks and no complaints. Overall for under $35 you can't expect topshelf quality, but I'll bet I still have a usable tool in ten years time. Four stars... With a good solid laser etched logo, five stars!"
__label__2,"Intense, Real, Moving: I started out reading this because my son's 6th grade class was reading it. This brought up intense emotions! Created the background for some great discussions with my son. A good book. I would definitely recommend it, although, I don't think it is appropriate for under 12-14."
__label__1,"Intollerant of other people's problems: I have to agree with Dobsons premise that God is forgiving but not tolerant of sin. But example gives credibility and his own failed marriage is but another example of ""whatever"". Of course he is faultless and it was all her problem...as usual.Edward"
__label__2,Must Read!!! DONT PASS ON THIS BOOK!!: This is a must read book about a phenomenal investigators journey into the bowels of the biker gang underworld. Non stop thrill ride from start to finish!
__label__1,Horrible: Horrible stand i would not recommend for anyone. Not even a beginner drummer thought it would be a decent temporary replacement but it wasnt. horrible stand.
__label__1,"A real disappointment: For all you Stephanie Plum Fans, I wouldn't bother buying this book. In my opinion its a waste of time. Its a collection of short stories and if I recall correctly there is only one about Stephanie Plum, which was a good little story.Other than that, it was a disappointing read. I wouldn't recommend it and if this has been your only exposure to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, don't give up hope! Start reading the normal Stephanie Plum novels they are much more fun!"
__label__1,"Not So Concise: I have to admit that there was some useful information in the book. Especially in setting fees, importance of retainers, the current outlook towards the consulting industry. While Mr. Holtz does have a great amount of knowledge, that can be quickly seen in the text, I find his writing style lacking and even frustrating. Many subjects appear in the book multiple times - a rehashing of subjects he has already discussed. This, and the back and forth references of subject matter was disconcerting. I think that if the duplication of information was removed from the book, the nearly 300 page book would be about 25% smaller."
__label__1,"Single Mom: First of all I am just like Denise, only I have one child and I too am a professional woman. I thought that this book was lacking. I couldn't finish this one. I have read all of his books this is the only one that I just plain didn't like. I will continue to buy his books. better luck next time."
__label__2,"Still Slammin... with the T.. the K .. the A: I think when I ordered this CD I wanted a CD full of Freestyle beats just like back in the day... But when I started to think about what I liked most about TKA it was the vocals... Yeah the music was slammin and that old Freestyle sound was great.. But these guys could sing... I would call myself a core fan I grew up on TKA then K7's CD but the bottom line is every artist/group has to grow.. And grow they did! WOW! I LOVE this new CD so much. It has the classic TKA vocals and great beats.. Some house, disco and even a little retro sounding freestyle and some nice ballads.. Give them a chance and grow with them..Ross Wilson"
__label__1,"Chitra Banerjee is probably capable of better writing: I bought ""Sister of my heart"" with great anticipation. Sorry it turned out to be a real letdown. I resent writing that tries to substitute exoticism for substance.Yes, the cave of rubies had me rubbing my eyes in disbelief.How far are Indian writers willing to go to peddle exotic India to the west?There is so much about India that can be conveyed without having to resort to exoticism. ""Arranged Marriage"" was very good.But ""Sister of my heart"" is a terrible letdown.The cover is well designed and thats the only nice thing I can say about the book. Its too much of a rehash of ""The Ultrasound"" for it to be published separately as a novel. Good luck with your next book,Chitra. I hope it turns out to be as good as ""Arranged Marriage""."
__label__2,"Beautiful!: The whole sled is beautiful and well-made, but I really love the hand-carved willow handle -- it has so much character, and it fits perfectly in my hands."
__label__1,my feet hurt so bad: These shoes looked so pretty.I was happy to wear them to a wedding.Standing on them was so hard.They are nice looking but my feet hurt so bad.Ieven soaked my blisters in foot bath but it didn't help quick enough.I can't recomend them because of the comfort thing.
__label__1,"All Women Are Evil (you've got to be kidding me): Ok, this was the most misogynistic movie I've seen in years. Could have been a great pyschological thriller, but, thanks to the unconvincing supernatural overtones, the moral of the story ended up being: All women are evil, controlled by nature, and so, they have no control over themselves. In the end, this means that all the horrific crimes against women are justified (I'm not kidding, the lead chick was writing her thesis on these crimes, but then came to realize that they were not crimes at all, as her true nature emerged). The director needs some serious therapy. Dafoe, what the hell were you thinking when you signed on for this one?"
__label__1,"Not Silent Enough...: Oh man, is this movie ever bad! Richard Dreyfuss, Linda Hamilton and Liv Tyler star in this convoluted yet ultimately stupid stew of tv movie cliches (the troubles of an autistic boy), a murder mystery and ""Fatal Attraction"" with a little ""Lolita"" for spice, because Liv's so hot. In fact, the only reason I watched this in the first place was because she's in it! Curse my manly urges for visiting this film upon me!It features one of the most misconceived plot devices yet employed in mainstream cinema- the kid can perfectly imitate any voice he's ever heard, and has a photographic memory, so they overdub his vocals, which turns him into a mini-""Mercury Theatre on the Air"" and the whole movie goes straight into the toilet. You have to see this scene to believe how horrible it plays.Really, if Liv wasn't in this, it'd be a 1-star effort."
__label__2,title: the first half on the CD is great all the songs make me want to move the second half drags a bit.
__label__2,micro wireless: Cateye Micro Wireless. I rated this at 4 stars.I am very satisfied with the product but I think the instructions could be improved.
__label__2,"Good roller backpak, but needs more padding: A sturdy roller backpack. Most of the rollr backpacks lack suffficient padding. This one is no exception, but it is probably one of the best among the bunch."
__label__1,"Boring: This is a tedious novel. It's only 180 pages long and I still had to push myself to bother finishing it. This is really nothing more than a short story padded out to short novel length and that's one of its many problems: The central mystery is uninteresting. The way it is written, 2 old men telling the story to a young woman, allows for no real action or confrontation. The 2 old men telling the story are irritating and long-winded, having much difficulty coming to a point, there is no resolution at the end and no point in the story being told. This is not a 'hard-boiled' crime novel as the cover suggests.I'm not really sure what this book is besides dull. Stephen king is a wonderful writer and it's enticing to see him try a new genre, but if anyone else had written The Colorado Kid, it would not have been published in this series."
__label__2,Cold Dish: Best mystery I have read to date. Very well written. Craig Johnson brings Absaroka county Wyoming to the reader in great detail. A must read. If you like to read westerns and/ or mysteries this is a perfect book and series for you. A modern day western mystery that will become a classic.
__label__2,"Bleeding Hearts and Needle Marks: Alright, I don't care if you heard it all and you've been from Van Halen to Dokken to Winger, you haven't heard real 80's hair metal till you check these guys out. I came across the tattooed love boys when I unearthed their vinal in the vault of a radio station i used to work at. I thought the cover art looked cool so I gave it a spin on the radio. I didn't think much of it untill I started getting requests every week for the silly thing! And you know, after you start to listen to it, it really grows on you! The band is talented and their songs are an anthems to a the party world of yesterday. (or the day before) With tracks like Stikky Stuff, Who you bringing to the party, and Sweet Little ragamuffin, these guys really know how to rock it down! If that doesn't sell you, you can actually hear the lead singer moaning over the guitar solo in Stikky Stuff. Now if that isn't 80's hair I don't know what is~!"
__label__2,"A Serious Introduction to Genes: I was looking for a good introductory type book into Genes and Biotech and I think I found one. This book starts from Cell and explanis DNA RNA all that good stuff with nice tecnical drawings showing the growth, partitions, mutations etc. It is written for educational purposes so it is not popular science type that all in words, it is serious but you do not have to be a med student to understand this. A good bilogy background and serious reading will do.Book continues with other subjects related to genes and DNA. I particularly liked the sections about Brain, the machinery and the design of it. it is a perfect book about DNA and Genes and life."
__label__2,"A different take on the ""Now"" and ""Then"" books out there!: This is one of the coolest Photo History books I have ever seen! It takes old black and white images from the Civil War and breathes new life into them! Showing what places looked like back 140 years ago and what they have become today! A great Civil War Battlefield companion! A must have for all Civil War Buffs!!"
__label__1,"A strange dichotomy: Denise Glenn is all in favor of women embracing the grace and freedom that Jesus offers. But, for some reason, she does not believe it should extend to young women--girls. Or boys, for that matter.Grace is for ALL. It is for children, too. But Denise Glenn promotes a very legalistic environment for children. No wonder so many adults have difficulty accepting God's grace--they've been trained that there's a punishment around every corner.If you've read this book or chose to read it, I highly encourage you to also read a copy of Families Where Grace is in Place by VanVonderen. At least look at another viewpoint. God said the Kindgom of Heaven belongs to such as these (children). I don't believe He is pleased when we accept His grace for ourselves but then turn around and deny grace to our children."

__label__1,"Problem is it doesn't work if you have 64 bit operating system: I bought this product some years ago but never got around to trying it and it got lost. It turned up the other day so I decided I would check it out. The audio works fine but the application won't install because I have a newer computer. This really points to the problem of the whole concept of a ""Lifetime"" anything. It only lasts as long as the technology that it uses.The content most likely is fine so the one star is only to warn you if you have a computer you bought in the last couple of years."
__label__1,"Uninspired blues playing: This is one of those recording where if you are a fan of the artist, you will love it, but if you are not, you won't. For me, Layla and Tears in Heaven were the tracks that I liked, but the covers of acoustic blues standards sounded tired and uninspired like he had played them too many times. If you are not a big Clapton fan, best listen to the original blues men do these."
__label__2,"Good Buy: I do like the improvement with my SRI. Coupled with new plugs and wires, made my 97 Civic get up to 40mph with driving out of Chicago in traffic. The pic shown for the product is another edition of the SRI but the correct image of the product with a different color can be seen on other 22-413B's on ecom.Mounting took a trip to the hardware store to buy some hardware for hanging plumbing because the mounts don't line up exactly. Turns out I was able to mount it in a very close but better location using the same chassis hole but using a homemade bracket that holds the SRI about 1.5-2 inches higher."
__label__2,"Works as promised: Purchased this item to survey a remote lake. Interested in bottom morphology and structure more than fish. Worked very well. As stated in the specs, you must use at slow speeds. Over 5mph it loses the bottom and gives strange readings. But below 5mph gives very good and accurate bottom and structure readings with decent detail for an inexpensive and portable system. Would prefer a much smaller/lighter weight battery option than the sealed lead acid battery. Otherwise met all expectations and needs."
__label__1,"Beware!: This was the 1st digital camera I bought (after looking at reviews for a year!) In the end I just couldn't find the camera that had everything I wanted so I decided to buy a 2MP camera just to get started, and then a higher MP one when the one I wanted came out.It was a huge disappointment, for 3 reasons: (1) it makes skin tones look brown all the time, and pictures need massive desaturation in Photoshop (sometimes up to minus 35!!); (2) the photos seem to be not quite in focus; and (3) when taking macro shots, you never know what's going to be in focus.On the plus side, the Canon interface is a joy to use and the computer software is very easy also.I returned it after a few days and bought an Olympus C-2100UZ, which is giving me exactly the pictures I would expect from a 2MP camera."
__label__2,"Christenberry always a good read.: I loved the book. As one of the other reviews stated, it was a little slow to get started but I did not have trouble staying interested. Judy Christenberry's books are always sweet and fun to read. I can hardly wait to read the new Triplet series."
__label__1,"In shreds within minutes!: Dental Kong with rope is certainly not for strong chewers. The rope was in shreds and parts of it were even ingested by my 15-lb terrier in a matter of minutes. The middle rubber piece is strong and can hold up to the most avid chewers, but I definitely would not recommend the rope. In my opinion, it's better just to buy the regular kong."
__label__2,"Comfy but a bit big: Bought this as a vehicle restraint for my son's service dog. He is a 50-lb border collie/german shepard cross. Seems to like wearing the vest, easy to buckle into car. But vest is a bit loose and unable to tighten any smaller."
__label__1,Not yet received the item: I have not received this item yet. Its been over a month since I placed the order. Is it not available?
__label__2,"PERFECT FOR POTTY PREP!: My daughter loves this book, she ""reads"" it herself all the time and she loves when I read it. It has definitely helped with preparation for potty training, would highly recommend!"
__label__1,Sell Outs...Every Last One Of Them...: They need to go back to thier garage and do some serious soul searching
__label__2,"Very useful: I am very happy with this unit!!!! The unit has given me clean water!!!! I have no problems with the glass collector!!!! It is worth the money!!!! Only disadvantage is it only makes one gallon. One needs more containers for more water. This amount gets used up quickly when I make coffee in my percolator, which is also stainless steel.One other problem is the PLASTIC lid for the collector jug. I do not use it, I use a ceramic plate instead. I dislike using any plastic. Other than this it is very good."
__label__2,"One of the most thought provoking books of the year: Should come with a money back guarantee, it was great"
__label__1,dont bother buying: i have used this a few times and the soft serve is either too soft or too hard. the texture is awful and i am sorry i bought it and didnt buy a real ice cream maker. you have to freeze the bowl for half a day and not handy. replacement bowls are expensive. not worth the money and it will probably end up at goodwill.
__label__1,"iGo Power Xtender: I must say the seller did everything right with shipping the extender. This review is for the product itself.When I saw the extender I was so excited because I was going to Hawaii and I knew my battery life on my Kindle Fire would not last the 5 plus hours. I ordered the extender but in the description I didn't notice I would have to buy a tip too. So after going to Radio Shack to buy the recharger tip where I found out that the model I bought has been discontinued. Off to Hawaii, what I found it is very hard to keep the tip in the Kindle while still using the device.I think for my next long trip I will be buying another product that hopefully works better."
__label__2,"An unprecedented glimpse behind the curtain: A fascinating and often disturbing vision of what the children of North Korea's elite will subject themselves to in order to please their ""father"", Kim Jong-Il. While I applaud the film-makers for their excellent work, I had to take exception with two points. First, they seem to accept without reservation the idea that the US would seriously consider invading North Korea. Second, their translation tones down the language that is used by their subjects to refer to Americans throughout the film. ""Migungnom"" is literally ""American bastard""."
__label__2,Amusing *and* intelligent: This book charmed me from the first page. Gavan and Priscilla's battle for love kept me smiling right along while the twists and turns kept me riveted. Highly recommended.

__label__1,"Thanks for the tip: I was on page 34 when I decided to find out what ecom readers were saying about this book. After reading just five of the reviews, I have decided not to waste my time, which is really too bad, because I have been waiting several months for this book! Southern Cross was funny, but this book so far has been just plain stupid Windy Brees....give me a break!"
__label__2,"Si te gusta la muscia con sentimiento....este es para ti!!!: Yolanda del Rio canta con mucho sentimiento y este CD tiene puras canciones buenas, si teines ganas de llorar de sentimiento, este es el bueno."
__label__1,Overstated Blah Blah: I was disappointed in this book. It is a collection of artificial situations with equally stilted responses. There's nothing in it you can't come up with on your own.The book was a waste of time and money. I'd give it a zero but there isn't one.
__label__1,"Had to stop playing it: My main complaint is the audio is horrible. I had it turned up to a point where the TV would normally be deafening. I just could hear excessive tape noise (white noise) and very LOW volume of vocals. I'd describe it as sounds low movie volume, and blank tape noise as loud, if not louder then the vocals.Video is okay. Granted it is an older recording, the video is pretty good.If the project could have been remastered the video and audio could have been enhanced. However for the investment to take that on, it would be a financial loss.As much as I would like to see it in the entirety, I had to quit it in 15 minutes. I had better expectations then it showed."
__label__2,"True Story, Huh?: Running With ScissorsWhat a movie based on a autobiographical account of the movies main character Augustin. His life is to say the least dysfunctional. He makes it through the with the help of a crazy yet meaningful family of loons that are actually quite lovable. To suffice, the movie is a must see because the acting is outstanding with a great ensemble cast including Annette Benning, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow and the lead whose name escapes me right now. This movie is a must see!!"
__label__1,"Disappointed: I purchased the Zoji in 2008. At first, it made good bread. However, after owning it for 6 months, it stopped baking bread correctly. The loaves that would result from the machine were burnt bricks that didn't rise, no matter how I tweaked the settings and changed the ingredients to be sure it wasn't me or anything I was using.I was so disappointed in this machine as I thought it would be superior - two paddles, all kinds of customization options... but none of them worked. The paddles started going wonky on me when I was making dough after the bread baking option crapped out. I Freecycled this unit and won't be buying another one.A shame, really - my best friend had one and she loved it, never had a problem with it. I think that they must not have a consistent production process or parts are faulty as another poster said.I would not buy another one. I had a Breadman before this and was able to use it for about 6 years before it died."
__label__2,"Great Action Hero Movie: One of the few action hero movies I like, the story has a great twist, sound track good , picture even better, this is a movie to have fun whilre watching, not a great story but keeps you interested, if you like Remo Williams, Buckaroo Bonazi, X-men then you'll like this movie."
__label__1,"Save your money: A good example of why you would go to the library or bookstore and see if the book was any good, prior to purchasing. Specifically, author hits a wide range of topics and delves into little. The book lacks summaries and lacks a general direction. Some nice photos, which probably resulted in the excessive price. Save your money."
__label__1,"Disappointed: My daughter got the PS1 with LCD screen combo for Christmas a year ago, and when we opened it and hooked it up, the screen did not work properly. The screen was black, but if you held it at an angle, you could tell there were graphics present. Yes, we adjusted the contrast and nothing helped. We took it back and they had no more in stock, so we went to Sears. We got their last one and I asked to hook it up and try it out before we left--just in case. Sure enough, it did the same thing, so we left empty handed. Finally, we found a combo unit at Target and it worked--for about 7 months. A few months ago, it started going on the fritz and if we unplugged the cable and fiddled with it, it would work again. It finally quit working alltogether. It was great while it worked, but now I'm leery as to how long another one will work. Is a 90 day warranty sufficient for an item so pricey? I don't think so. I'm faced with replacing it, because to fix it would probably cost even more. What a shame."

__label__2,"Great for Casual Fans, a Dissappointment to Hardcore Fans: The Red Hot Chili Peppers are among the greatest bands of the last 20 years, perhaps topped only topped by Nirvana and AC/DC with Brian Johnson(Bon Scott died in 79, it doesnt count), so obviously it will get all sorts of followings, casual listeners who want to listen to some of the Red Hot Chili Peppers songs without having to buy all of the CD's and hardcore fans who burn their own greatest hits collection. I recommend this CD to the former, and I am ranking it thusly. It had RHCP's better songs which will wholly satisfy a casual fan. Hardcore fans, if you havent already picked this one up, I suggest you stay that way because I would give this two stars in the perspective of bigger fans. Overall this is a CD meant for casual fans to enjoy, while more hardcore fans should stick with the albums or a burn of their greatest hits."

However, it has another card in the box. Fine, it's a better card, but not what I need. So I send it back to Hauppauge to get a real PVR-150. That was like 3 weeks ago. WHERE IS MY DAMN CARD?!?!?"
__label__2,"Entertaining. Another great series by Terry Brooks.: I don't know who these ""reviewers"" are but they are probably the same people who think only ""deep"" movies like Ghandi are worthwhile.I liked this book. It was entertaining and I think it made the character of John Ross more believeable. He got tired of all the problems and failures and quit. I think everyone can relate to this. He's also taken in by someone he loves and trusts. This is also very human. I think explioting John's weaknesses in this book made it more real.I look forward to the next ""Knight"" book."
__label__2,"This is the ""North American"", kick @ss format!: Yes, this is the North American Format--works just fine on my cheap Japanese DVD player. The DVD is high quality considering NMA is a band of limited means. It boasts 8 different quality camera angles and the sound quality is great. This was shot a month or so after the 2003 Justin/Dean tour, and has a song from ""Navigating by the Stars"" on it. This is a must for any NMA fan!Keep the faith."
__label__2,"Underrated album , now underrated and clearer: The moodies followup to ""Voyager"" is finally remastered and has never sounded better. This album however deserves much more credit than it gets.Yes it's not the moodies clasic seven with ""Mike Pinder"" , nor is it ""voyager"", but this album has some very quality songs and Ray Thomas's best I ever heard especially his well sung (written by Grame edge) Going Nowhere. And now it is remastered once again beatifully by Mr. Hayward himself, Maybe Justin needs to remastered other artist as well. But if you think this cd is still outdated,listen to the terrible Other side of life (with the exception of the two main tracks). and this album will have a fresh new sound for you."

__label__2,"Wonderful, readable, and insightful: This book is a wonderful and readable review of monastic life. As a ""normal"" person (not a monastic) my assumption is that monastic life is overwhelmingly complicated and difficult to life. This book does a wonderful job of explaining the ideas behind monastic life in an easy way that is not the least bit overwhelming. This book includes much spirituality that I enjoyed thinking about and comparing to my own spirituality. If you are interested in religious studies, you'll really enjoy this book."
__label__2,"Venereology cures the young boy's clap!: Ah yes, one of merzbow's long, drawn out and monotonous works -but only at first. The sound is exquisite and makes me want to sleep. The excised members on the sleeve are quite efficacious. I recommend this to anyone who likes Merzbow and wants to start their collection off with a screech. I also enjoy the memories of love and warmth I get when listening to I Lead You Toward Glorious Times. Have a good one everybody."

__label__2,"Exemplary !: I haven't seen writing this carefully crafted in a long time. Gave me goose bumps! Liar's Club is the kind of book that inspires other people to write. And it's a memoir! You will find some really poignant, often terrifying observations from the view of a child. Karr is not afraid to show the spontaneity that leads a child to do gauky and often hateful things. I had forgotten some of the irrational behavior I engaged in as a kid, and this book brought it back and nearly puts it under a microscope. The pace of this memoir quickens after the first third of the book, but it takes that long to develop these very three dimensional characters. (I keep forgetting these ""characters"" are/were real people!) Mary Karr deserves a standing ovation. Read this book. It's a true pleasure, and you will be better for having read it."
__label__2,I like 'em: They are salty (but not too much so) and crunchy and have a sufficient amount of nutrition. I don't waste them on salads--just eat them right out of the bag. They shipped quickly and had a good expiration date from ecom.
__label__2,"the companion movie to the graduate-both chas. r. webb bks: the excellent, under-rated richard benjamin brings out the catcher in the rye angst of charles richard webb's masterpiece book. a complete shame and mystery why the vhs only was released over the years. a post-modern masterpiece that eventually will be released in a dvd. time will pressure the intellectual/relationship-centered community and this gem will be given its rightful place in the marketplace. until then, bug tcm,etc to air it. hipster/beatnik sensibility par excellence."
__label__1,"Not good Cyber/Science Fiction....: After reading parts of this novel in Time magazine a while ago I finally picked up this book in an airport. If it hadn't been that I had nothing else to do on a long flight there is no way I would have taken the time to wade thru this book. As an effort at Science Fiction or CyberPunk it really is bad, very bad. There are plenty of authors that do justice to this genre, Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling for example, Caleb Carr is not one of them."
__label__1,"The wort of the wort!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I bought like 5 different types of ear plugs and this one are the wort of all of them, it never adjust the correct way on the ear, also it's very easy to lose it when you are trying.Great brand but this product doesn't represent it."
__label__2,"Wonderful Product: I bought these so I could make my own hamburger buns, and the result is fantastic! Now, instead of the buns spreading a little as they bake, they get all the rise they should!The only downside is how easily these rust if you don't get them COMPLETELY dry.LOVE THEM!"
__label__1,"Shockingly Disappointing: I'm very optimistic about an artist's work and I'm not quick to judge anybodys work as disappointing unless it's just that. Being that Mr.Ware produced and co-wrote one of the greatest albums of all time(I Want You). I was definitely eager to hear him do his own work. Although the writing is pretty good on the album, the songs just dont seem to jump out at you. There is not much to it that would makes you want to hear it again and again, and I'm a huge fan of of 70's soul. Maybe that is what Motown thought also, maybe they thought fans would rather spend their last on a sandwich. Which is maybe the reason Mr.ware didn't get the support for this album that he believed he deserved. I still honor him for his genius as a writer particularly with the work he's done with Marvin and Minnie Riperton."

__label__1,"Predictable and disappointing...: I had very high expectations for this book, based on the review and recommendation from Comso. But it was so disappointing. In this age of women finding power within, this book basically devalued it all - basic story - fat girl, no friends or men, the lust/love of her life considers her only a ""work friend"". Loses 100 pounds and becomes thin and beautiful, and has all men flocking to her, including the man who previously never gave her a second thought. The whole story focused on external beauty and how ""beautiful people"" get everything in life. There was probably a subtheme of finding power within once you realize you're already beautiful on the outside, but it was very hidden, and certainly won't be found by the women likely to read this - those looking for validation to lose weight and possibly develop eating disorders, thinking it will solve all of life's problems."
__label__1,"What Happed EA?: Next Gen? No, not when the ""current generation (i.e. x-box)"" variation is better than it's superior big brother for the 360.I won't go into all the details seeing that most reviewers have already nailed the major points (see below).I just don't understand how EA ca n fall this far short. Even the little details like every player wearing Reebok cleats (which they don't) or the fact that you can't create you own player the way you were able to on the older versions. Yea, these are small details, but that is what made EA's Madden Franchise great, paying attention to details and giving the gamer what they wanted.Watch out EA, 2K games is on the verge of winning my loyalty!"
__label__1,"No Warranty on probes: CAUTION: My unit had been used about six times when the first probe failed. The second probe failed the next time I used it.What's more, the probe(s) ARE NOT covered by Polders warranty, and cost $17+ EACH by UPS ground (USPS postage would be 60 cents).Even worse, Polder didn't even respond to my email."
__label__1,"Ethnocentric Fiction: Lane Pool's classic is very innacurate but a fun read, from a travelog perspective. However, what Jackson projects in his introduction is incredibly distorted. The reality of Muslim Iberia is quite simple: Arab armies (mainly from Syria) along with Berber tribes from what is now Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia invaded Iberia in 711. These people were Muslims but overwhelmingly white. A small number of blacks came to Spain as slaves or servants of the Arabs and Berbers. Moors, a confusing term because it has been so misinterpreted throughout history, were NOT Negroes at all. Rather, they were Arabs and Berbers. The Muslim Arabs/Berbers in Spain (and Portugal) made clear racial and ethnic distinctions between themselves and Black Africans. Black African cultural contributions in Iberia were/are, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. That is the plain truth Mr.Jackson, not the ""truth"" as YOU would like to see it."
__label__1,"Very Basic and Naieve Book: I bought this book hoping to find a good reference in accounting information system with a focus on processes, yet I found a nieve, elementery book that is more of a help to a student just starting to learn information systems. The star rate is only because I have a book which might be helpful to any student having no clue about Information System. The business process approach is a big word to be part of the title as it is far beyond the real process and relating information system as I knew it.It was really a disappointing buy"
__label__2,"gripping: although the recounting of nazi atrocities was unsettling, the evocation of paris in the occupation years and the eventual coming to justice of war criminals, was crafted in a stunning way. learning that the author's mother to whom he dedicates the book, had died of motor neuron disease made those scenes all the more sad, but the downward spiral is lovingly chronicled. i couldn't put it down, finding the truth unravelling, reading far past my bedtime."

__label__1,"Certainly not for professional developers!: After reading through this book, I was not sure if this book is focused on Java programming or XML or Servlets and JSP programming, although it claims to be about how to integrate all these technologies together. The book overall is not very well organized and it is tough sometimes to really make out what the authors are trying to convey. As for the example code, it is not difficult to make out that the authors are from academia and certainly are not developers who hack it out in the real world."

They don't fit, the formed well for the stock mats is smaller than the WeatherTech mats and as thus they leave a pocket just in front of the accelerator peddle. This pocket is where you would place your foot and cause the mats to lift up under the peddle. Remember the Toyota Recall for floor mats interfing with the accelerator?I contacted the company and request to return the mats for a full refund, they indicated they will pay only one way,I have to eat the shipping cost for the other direction. I find this completely unacceptable, I thought I was dealing with a quality company, regretfully they are lacking in this area. I will never purchase from this company again."
__label__1,"SUCKS INK LIKE A SPONGE! MEMORY USE FUNCTION???: I use this printer/fax very sparingly because of the problems. One, the ink disappears after very little usage; The cartridges are so poor that the ink is simply drying out. Very, very, very disappointed. I have older, smaller printers that the ink last 5X longer! Secondly, the memory light has a mind of its own. it lights up saying there is a document in memory, when you go thru the step process to print from memory, there is nothing there. I've powered down/up hoping it will reset, but theres that light again. after abt a week, it goes out! Third, the fax documents will shift and cut off the bottom of a page. I've tested this with Canon customer svc where they would fax a doc to me and sure enought the bottom is cut off. NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT."
__label__2,I had a hard time putting this book down.: I spent the day on the couch reading this book. There are very few books that I can't put down when the sun it out. The suspense held my attention. The social aspects of the town believeing in Wayne was an interesting thing to overcome for Joe. The integrity of Joe is something we need more of. Read it - you'll enjoy it.

__label__1,"Don't expect it to last more than several days!: Got this for my 6 year old. Followed directions CAREFULLY. Once you remove thehelmet piece, it doesn't ever go back on the same. Now the helmet slips and falls off. Even the folks at the toy store cannot get it back together. Went to Toys R us, they have received multiple Voice Changers back for the same reason. It broke my son's little heart-he had been ""saving"" for this product and even fashioned a cape ,gloves and shoes to go with it.It was five stars fun until we had to adjust the size! Avoid wasting your thirty bucks."
__label__1,"Too Many Errors: This book is very frustrating. There are many errors in the practice Math section that make it difficult for someone who is trying to brush up on their math skills to follow. There are also a fair number of errors in the practice tests on the CD as well. Not to mention that the program errors out sometime when you go from section to section, forcing you to start from scratch.Very disappointing and unacceptable for a book that costs $32. Save your time and money and buy a different prep book."

__label__1,"Time Not So Well Spent: An all-around trifle that left me disappointed when reading, and utterly unmoved upon complition; to the extent that a week later I had to pick the book up and read the insdie of the jacket to remember what it was about. As a satire it is weak after the intial set-up and becomes total (and unfortunatley woefully unfunny) farce at the end, any larger points that were trying to be made are forever lost to cartoonish and plodding plotting."
__label__1,"Confused, poorly organized rehash of Dolley Madison's life: This was one of the worst biographies I have ever read. I found no new information about Mrs. Madison, and the information that was rehashed was terribly organized for a disruptive reading experience. Over and over again the author jumps from topic to topic, interupting what seems like it could be an interesting arguement or point with some unrelated piece of information that destroys the rhythm of the thought. The information on the complex relationships within the Payne and Madison families is written out rather than expressed in a family tree and is nearly useless. Photographs are sprinkled throughout the book [...] but the captions are all at the end of the book. I found it very disruptive to have to turn to the back to find out what I was looking at and what the significance of the photo might be. Very, very disappointing."
__label__1,"A book without much usefulness: Just read this book because I thought it may have some useful information regarding UML. I can't find much as other reviewers indicated.

__label__2,"Brava: This will probably be my favorite story in this series(although I have always enjoyed the story of Ruth a lot, and anticipate her story). What Rahab did was a beautiful,unselfish act that God never forgotten and didn't let pass by. it just goes to show you how God always will use someone to help him in His cause. And how many wished for a man liked Salmon? I mean despite what he saw, he saw her heart, and wanted her despite her past. That takes an extraordinary person to do that. But, one thing he did was pray and seek wise counsel before anything else. It showed that despite his feelings, he prayed for God's counsel. What a beautiful story!"
__label__2,"A Great Set!: I purchased this set a few month's back, been so impressed with them, that I went out of my way to offer a review. They are extremely durable, I put something very hot in one of them and it was no problem. Also, they are very easy to clean (a plus to us who have no dishwasher) I just filled the very dirty bowl with water and in 5 minutes, all the stuck on food came off with a quick brush stroke. They are great to use for holding potato chips or other snacks, because of their colors. They are very easy on the wrists when used for mixing, because they are deeper with a smaller cirumfrance than other mixing bowls. I really can't believe that I got such a great set at such an inexpensive price."

I ordered five Global knives very late on the evening of the 15th and they will be arriving on the 17th. That's essentially ""Next Day"".When you think about it, ecom and UPS (et al.) gain nothing by delaying your order. Once you have ordered and paid, the inventory becomes a liability to them. It's much wiser and economical for them to get rid of it (ship it to you) ASAP to make room for other stock. They aren't going to say ""Gee, this guy _wants_ it in 5-7 days, we can't ship it yet!!!"""

__label__2,"Not quite an exact replacement: The Mini OEM filter has a strong plastic housing that makes inserting it into the air box quite straightforward. The Bosch filter does not have this rigid frame, and as a result it is more difficult to insert it into the air box. It's also a tight fit, so that makes it more difficult too.Will probably try another brand of filter when I change this one next time."

However, it is pretty, and the satin quilted hanger that it comes on is almost as exciting as the garment itself. I would have liked it to be longer. The chemise or babydoll fit me very strangely, and I will not be wearing it. I've worn the robe once or twice, but would get more use out of a longer one. However, it wasn't worth returning because it was so cheap that return shipping would eat up most of the refund."
__label__1,THIS WASN'T A VERY GOOD GAME FOR GAMEBOY.: First of all this wasn't a good game that gameboy made. It was to easy. Very easy that I beat the whole game in 9 hours. I didn't use any cheats to do it. I agree with one of the early reviews that the guards can't see you. You can be right beside them and they will would keep walking. The only way that they can see you is if youre in their path of walking. The only reason that I gave it a star was that the last mission was the hardest of them all. This game needs to be improved and longer because it only has 10 short missions. I would only recommed this game to people who love easy and short games. Also people who liked the mission impossible movie.
__label__1,"Some Worthwhile Character Performances: The storyline was old and tired to me. I did like the fact that it was filmed in 29 Palms, which is close by to where I live. I liked that it used a take on the Indian Casinos, which are all the rage here. I like Jeremy Davis and he has a cool subtleness in the way he performs, very sensitive and creating a depth to his character. I liked O'Donnell who plays against his cast type and does a good job, he really looks the part. My favorite was Bill Pullman, that guy can really act tripped out. I think he acts really freaky in this film and I liked that. I wish he had more scenes. Rappaport who is also good is in the film. I like him, its seems like he can play a cop good in any film. The other characters were over the top and I couldn't get into them, except Cook who plays her character pretty straight. I loved the ending, that was funny. The rest of the film was too predictable and I got bored with it. Anyways, for me it was probably 2 stars.Lisa Nary"
__label__1,"missing information: In this set it does not contain any information on Dick York even though this is his last season on the series as Darrin. However, they did put in an informercial in Spainish before each show on the later disc's with no english translation at all.A little back ground on Dick Yorks years as Darrin would have been a great bonus but alas not to be."
__label__2,"Very lively, very timely look at N. Korea: I'm re-reading *Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader* after a couple of years. Once again, I'm impressed with its readability. Bradley K. Martin's book is a genuine pleasure, despite the 900 pages of solid information packed between its covers. Given current developments in North Korea, the book is once again an especially timely read, one of the few authoritative channels, at least in English (and Japanese), into the attitudes of the North Korean regime and, to the extent that is possible, into the mind of its leader. Five stars. Cheers, Collin Piprell (writer, editor, author of *MOM*)"

__label__1,"Sorry I Wasted the Money: We loved this pool for three weeks, which is as long as we had it. This morning, I went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4"" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic. I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours. A total waste of money."
__label__2,"Easy Steps: I recently purchased this book ...again; it had ""gone missing"" from my library. Out of all the books that I have on preaching, this is by far my favorite. Ken Davis is an accomplished speaker and author; his experience breaks down the talk process into easy, relevant steps.Chapter 2 - ""Objective Preparation"" is my favorite source to share with beginning speakers. It really keeps them focused on a single message (SCORRE method), and the subsequent chapters help develop the talk in ways that will be easily retained by both the speaker and the audience.Even if you are an accomplished speaker, this book is a great gift or loaner for others who might seek your help. It is well laid out, illustrated with amusing cartoons, and serious about its purpose."

__label__1,"Not for the beginner...uh...me...: I bought this book 2 years ago. The book has many tips for the beginner but since it has a terrible organization method (I did not understand it all that well...), it cannot be used as a step-by-step tutorial and many tips (chapters) include terms that are not explained until many tips ahead !The book starts well , explaining many terms as many books fail to do, but, as it advances - it loose its focus. One example: I saw the ""*"" that appeared in some functions but only after one hour of searching in the code , did I understand that these meant POINTERS ! As a result of this book (and others on the subject, I must say!) , I am currently expecting 2 more books from ecom.com in my mail box."

Captivating, and fun, positive and creative. SARK's writing is great, it opens up your eyes into seeing things in a whole new perspective. Hopefully this one is as good as her others, I think it will be for sure! I love her writing, which is very real and original, I WANT MORE!!!"

__label__1,"Not too useful: This student solutions manual only includes the solutions that are already in the back of the book. Some of them give more explanation, but some of the confusing solutions only give the same answer as the textbook. It doesn't seem worth the expense if there isn't a lot to help me understand the process, how to solve problems."
__label__2,"An inspiring journey with a true disciple of Christ: Albert Schweitzer was an acclaimed organist, a world authority on Bach, a church pastor and principal of a theological seminary, a university professor with a doctorate in philosophy, and above all a humanitarian. This book gives a stunning account of how he grew into his ideals and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in ethics or philosophy. I was left with an urge to read more about this true human, who believed and practiced the basic principle of goodness, as I finished reading the book. Schweitzer's faith in what he believes in and how he transforms it to the needy is absolutely inspiring. The epilogue of the book is very thought provoking as it gives a clear idea of his vision and the relevance of it in the world we live in."

__label__1,"Gets some Facts wrong: Quentin Reynolds has written an interesting book; however he gets some things wrong. First of all he declares Mick Mannock the highest scoring ace for the Allies with 73 Victories. The fact is that the Great French Ace, Rene Fonck, with 75 confirmed victories was the highest scoring Ace. I have no idea how Quentin Reynolds got this simple fact wrong after 25 years of research. Also he is heavaly biased against Ritcofen( Red Baron). He makes it seem like Red Baron is a heartless killer that enjoys killing, which is simply not the case."
__label__1,"TOTAL JUNK!: This is the most ridiculous ""kids"" toy I have ever seen. First the directions are inconsistent with many mistakes and contradictions. Second many of the experiments require the scientist, a young child, to wait hours and sometimes a day to see the results. What were these people thinking??? Not to mention many of the ""experiments"" are basically the same thing with very similar results. Save yourself the time and money and grab baking soda and vinegar for your own volocano and you will get better results!"
__label__1,"A healthy vegetarian's nightmare.: I appreciate the information about fat and her advise about not being afraid of food but I can't buy her support for meat and dairy especially the bacon and eggs cholesterol reducing theory. I think she should be using her celeb status to promote healthy beautiful delicious alternatives, that yes, may have small amounts of fat (in accordance with a portion of her theory) but yet would have even better cholesterol reducing benefits, aid in diabetes maintenance, help the environment, and be rooted in compassion instead of complete self gratification.Sounds like something ""Chrissie"" would have written."
__label__2,"Very worthwhile purchase--Harper is an excellent artist: I first heard this album about two months ago and finally bought it on a whim last week. I was very impressed, especially with Harper's voice. Though it's not the most pleasant-sounding voice I've ever listened to, the range of emotion he is able to display with it, from the outpouring of his soul on ""Beloved One"" to the upbeat, love-note sentimentality of ""Steal My Kisses,"" is like nothing I've heard before. The second half of the album is a bit better than the second, though. ""Less"" is a bit grungy for my taste. However, I plan to eventually buy all of Harper's album's--he's an excellent artist."
__label__2,"Nice writing style, great images: This book was really well done. The images of thunderstorms, clouds, tornadoes and various rare weather events are just wonderful. The writer's style is casual and friendly. I really liked the way he would toss in interesting tidbits amoung the technical scientific writing---he'd be writing in depth about how tornadoes form, and would mention as an aside a restaurant all the tornado chasers liked! Anyone who has a fascination for tornadoes will really enjoy this book."
__label__2,"Very funny classic retro movie!: I've always loved this movie, the special effects are incredible and the cast surprised me (I didn't know Jack Black was in this movie until recently). I always liked the way they made the movie very retro looking, since it was based on trading cards from 1960's. If you're into wacky sci-fi comedies, I HIGHLY recommend Mars Attacks! It's a shame there are no extras on this DVD, but the movie is worth getting, especially at under $10."
__label__2,Hitachi EC12: I was surprised to received the Hitachi EC12 a day early. Unfortunately it had a broken filter box case. I called the company and the part was in the mail no questions asked. So far I have had this unit for over 3 years. The pressure control knob fell apart in my hand but a quick to the shop fixed that. I don't know if the knob failure was my fault or worn part. I do wish I had purchased a compressor with more horsepower but this one is a keeper. It does 87% of jobs I need.

At first glance, it appears very useful but when you actually try to work with the source code, it has major problems. I guess it still has some value because you can kind of go through the code, but it irks me that they do not provide a working example. It appears to me that the code was written with the beta version of .net which is all fine and dandy, but they really should post a working version of the code... I am attempting to get the code to work, so I guess about the only positive thing you can say is its giving me much experience debugging... But to me there are an unacceptable amount of errors in the source code, stuff thats just way out in left field.I emailed the authors and I got a response saying that they have a ""working version "" of the code and expected to be posting the code on the internet ""soon""...Hmm..."
__label__2,MOTHER LOVES IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I bought this for my 91 year old Mother and she loves always knowing what time it is - the day of the week - the date and whether it's night or daytime. She had started calling me about 3:30 in the morning thinking it was the afternoon and she would be embarrassed. I would tell her it was fine and that I was glad she was o.k. but this clock totally stopped those calls. She had me to put up a bright yellow post-a-note by the AM light and she can always tell when it's daytime. This is a wonderful gift for your aging loved-one. Thanks Dynamic Living!

__label__2,"B+: Cody makes a fresh statement in her debut, a memoir about a year discovering her wild side by stripping (among other acts). She is at home making numerous pop culture references, and the savvy reader will pick up on these eagerly. Cody doesn't hold back, explicitly detailing her numerous adventures that makes this a great, untraditional read. It's quite refreshing to read something so blatantly honest, so thrillingly open. Indeed, I raised my eyebrows a few times at her almost callous comments, but in doing so felt gratified to know that I wasn't a passive reader - Cody engages you, takes you along for the ride. Though there wasn't anything particularly groundbreaking or heartfelt about the book, her genuine anecdotes make up for the superficial lifestyle which she describes."

I purchased both so I could compare side by side. I returned the Archos and haven't looked back. The Lyra doesn't have all features available at this time, but two firmware updates have been released less than 3 weeks apart, each enabling more and more features. The features available out of the box are adequate and the controls are easy to use and comfortable. The Archos is big and clumbsy and the battery life is worse."

I would highly recommend that people read this compelling part of our country's history."

Now I ordered 5 more copies that I want to give to family and friends. I love this book! I often found that when I picked it up each night, it would offer words of comfort or advice for the very problem/situation that I was dealing with. I truly did feel God's presence when reading this book. I hope that you will too."
__label__2,"Surprisingly good: At first, the storyline seemed odd and slow. However, the further I read, the more intriguing it became. This book would be well-suited for young teens. Older readers will also enjoy reading this, especially if they remember themselves at the age of thirteen.What I most enjoyed about this story was 'watching' Paul grow from an awkward 'wuss' into a young man with strong character. It was also gratifying to see that the characters had to face consequences for their actions.My only criticism is of the unrealistic references to Paul's IEP. Being a special educator, I am well aware that there is more to an IEP than a piece of paper acknowledging an impairment."

It breaks right at the point where it fits into the hole in the headset itself. My first one broke three and a half weeks after I received as a gift. They sent me two new ones for free as a one time courtesy, and the second one had nearly broken as well, but by then I had received my new bluetooth headset, the Jabra Freespeak, which I wholeheartedly recommend over the Plantronics M1000. Don't buy this headset! If I could give it zero stars, I would!!"

It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as ""constrained"" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position, and it is still sorely lacking. I am so grateful that he lives and writes."
__label__1,"Good for first time beginners- but a little TOO basic.: I got this book as a gift since I just recently started making my own greeting cards for family and friends. While I did learn some interesting tips, I think the projects are a bit too basic, and the end result isn't as spectacular as you may be hoping for. Some of the projects require a sewing machine or tools you probably won't use too often (like for working metal).There are little galleries in between projects, and some of the cards are much nicer than the projects in this book- making me feel like the book was lacking (a lot).I'd pick a more complex card book over this one (even if the projects seem more intimidating, the end result will be MUCH NICER)- at least it would give you something to work towards. I would only recommend this book to a teacher who wants to come into class with some interesting projects for your students."

I am no longer interested in the bunch of dreadful characters sprinkled throughout the book and don't particularly care where the story will lead. After reading most of the comments here - I am well advised it seems to give up this 'also ran' - life is too short.What went wrong John - this is a huge disappointment, especially coming from the author of such wonderful previous novels. Is the Brethren the work of a ghost writer.Grisham has progressively declining over the past few books and now I believe he has sunk as low as you can get - absolutely no more Grishams for me!"
__label__1,"Just plain bad!!!: I started to watch this movie and was bored from the start. I didn't expect a big Hollywood production or anything but the makers of the film should have been more than grade schoolers at least. The story was bad and the acting was awful. It was either over dramatized or under acted in most of the movie. The story starts out with a woman dying and everyone being upset about it. Granted, this would be very true. But in the next sequence, the brother-in-law of the dead woman is soo upset he is not performing at work and is having nightmares about her being gone. Come on....don't you think that it should have been the husband of the woman that was having these problems? The rest of it is just that stupid as well. I am not recommending this movie to anyone. There are alot better out there that are cheaper in price and alot more entertaining to watch."
__label__2,"Simple, effective design: Assembled unit with regular 2X4 studding material. Measured the custom width I needed for the rack. Cut a set of 2X4 rails out of one 2X4X8 length and used left over piece for a 'T' brace between the the 2X4 rails. Filled rack to the top with wood. A little flex on the rails but feels sturdy enough. It works...Note: You supply the screws. Also, because studding 2X4s are less than 2"" X 4"", there is some ""slop"" in the rail slot openings - they are larger - closer to a ""real"" 2X4 size. Not a problem but worth noting."
__label__2,"Beautiful lives up to it's title: I love Christina Aguilera, not only is she beautiful she is also talented and not affraid to speak her mind. I am glad that Christina chose Beautiful as the second single off of Stripped. I think that this single backs up the fact that Christina has a range to her that other pop stars do not have. This song is exactly what the title says, Beautiful. I think that it sends out a very positive message to people from all walks of society, and I also love how the video, which is included on the cd, brings the lyrics of the song to life. Overall, I highly recommend Beautiful to everyone."
__label__1,"BAD Windows 98 Compatibility ... baaaAAAAAHHHHD Tech Supp.: The utility installer is not compatible with Win98 installer engine. So, while the product might work in their lab. under Win98, the installer doesn't let you get there to find out. The software just won't install. And, since the drivers are not resident on the CD you can't even install it manually. This is why they tell you not to plug the card into the PCI slot first. I guess the drivers are buried somewhere in the code of the utility installer. The file that you download from their website (a supposed ""upgrade"") is actually the same version on the CD.Tech support is farmed out to a foreign country.

__label__2,"Jean Michel's Debut Is His Best!: Mike Oldfield's Tubelar Bells from 1973 may well have started the ambiant music genre, but I not so sure it's stood the test of time.In contrast Oxygene from 1976 is intriging while still being melodic, unlike some offerrings from Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream.It is easy to play all the way through, although Oxygene (IV) was a very successful single which alerted me the this album in the first place.Maybe not quite as groundbreaking as Wendy Carlos' 1968 Switched On Bach, Oxygene set the scene for eletronic music to be more widely accessed and enjoyed."

__label__1,"Full of stereotypes: Both this book and ""Jane Eyre"" seem to say that women have to be plain and destitute to be considered virtuous, honest and worthy of love. Men, on the other hand, must be capricious, unpredictable and often offensive to be really attractive. Then, of course, under the heroines' care these men improve greatly and become quite ordinary or at least less irate and offensive. It is further explained that these wonderful men are not innately lacking consideration to others, but only as a result of a twenty year-old unhappy love experience. Both ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Villette"" have their charm and can be enjoyed, especially if read in early teens, both books have wonderful supporting characters (Madame Beck, for example), but the books come across as romantic and frustrated teenager fantasies rather than a realistic description of relationships between men and women."

__label__2,"excellent game: I purchased this game as a gift for a fellow lover of the original Settlers of Catan game. After playing this expanded version I'm not sure we'll ever go back to the original game. This version does take some getting used to and does take a bit longer to play than the original game the few times we've played thus far. This expansion set offers additional variety to the original Settlers game in that there are many different set scenarios you can play from which differ in the number of victory points you need to win and methods you can use to gain victory points. It is simple to learn how to play this expansion, but I will be playing it for a while before I feel like I have mastered my method of winning."
__label__2,"~~just as good as the first.... maybe better~~: I couldn't wait to get my hands on the second installment in this series and it was worth the wait!!!! This was just as good as the first book, if not better! I laughed throughout the whole thing and there were even a few tears shed. I got excited at the prospect of Becky shopping throughout Manhattan. Her experiences literally gave me chills as shopping in New York City has always been a dream of mine!!! This is a very fast read and anyone looking for some great chick lit or just a good pick me up in general should check out this book."
__label__2,"Good: The performance is good. No problems at all for me. Ppl complain about the battery case, Well, if you can figure it out, its easy. I open the compartment and close it several times a day with out breaking it. I dont think it consumes a lot of battery power(Well, I always take of the batteries after use). The funny thing is the battery arrangement, generally the -ve side of the battery goes towards the spring, but here, one of the batteries go in reverse. So there is a +ve side of one battery going to the spring in the compartment. That was terribly dumb on the manufacturing part.Another glitch for me was the size. Small is cute but not for men with huge palms. It might be really good for women but it sometimes pains my hand. Now that was a lil dumb on my part to buy a small one.Something where they could improve is... use a button that is handy to switch of the mouse. The switch off button is like a reset button where you always have to use a pen or pin."
__label__1,"disappointed: It is disappointing to see the fifth release of material on CD that has already been released on CD. It could have been made very much better. I am very disappointed, it seems the New Doors (as everybody should call them) are only in in for the myth and for the money."
__label__2,"Classic Arthur C Clarke novel: Arthur C Clarke wrote multi stranded science fiction -his novels usually have many layers of plot, social commentary, scientific exposition and futuristic prediiction. ''Imperial Earth' is a fine example. Clarke weaves a story from the major plot lines of a colonial dynasty on Titan looking to ensure its succession via cloning, and the political relationships it has to maintain back on Earth. Against the backdrop of what human society might be like in 2276 as the 500th anniversary of US independence is celebrated, the story also has a mystery novel element. Written in 1976, it brilliantly predicts what daily life would be like with universal, portable access to information and communications - though I suspect Clarke would have been surprised at how much sooner that has come to pass."
__label__1,Best song missing...poopie: The one song I wanted is not on this disc....the best song in the whole movie....the tango song ....that really stinks
__label__2,Good listening: This is a very good purchase for the wonderful voice and songs I can listen to. The disc had no problem and was like new.
__label__2,Love it!: Bought this item from a different retailer and love it. My only complaint (and a small one at that) is that the pillow isn't connected to the hammock like similar hammocks from other manufacturers. I bought it to lay in the sun - be warned if you do though - it gets very hot very quick.
__label__2,"Great Buy: I am so pleased with this vacuum cleaner...I cannot believe what you get for the money. I will not mention brands, but I have used my neighbor's $400.00 one, and this one is easier to push, and does a more thorough job.I remember one of the complaints being that it was very loud...what vacuum isn't.? It certainly would not warrant not buying it for that reason. I would recommend this to anyone out searching for a new vacuum, but I just hope that five years from now I can still say the same.....after seeing what other models are priced at, I cannot believe I got this beauty for $70.00 If I had to think of one possible thing I would change in it, it would be for a longer cord...but that it the lazy in me.....so that I don't have to go and unplug it when I want to use it 3 rooms away........."

__label__2,"A worthy item: I have lots of grandchildren and sleepover mornings are high pancake demand times. This grill performs well, has lots of space and the drain function is brilliant. Like any grill, storage is a pain and this larger one is more difficult. To start the drain you pull out on the side handles. They have stops and that part is well designed. It is disconcerting to pick it up to more it and feel the handle slip. I am pleased with it and it is a more utilitarian piece of kitchen equipment than the rectangular grills I seem to replace every five years. These are very minor issues at worst. Great grill and worth the purchase price. Yes, I'd buy another again and do recommend it."
__label__1,"Biggest ripoff I've found on ecom: All I have to say is the instructions are in a diffrent language, you don't even get a translator. Plus this stuff looked like it was shot in the early 80's by what the people are wearing so if you're looking for martial arts for MMA you probably need the most modern disciplines out there."
__label__1,"Panasonic- ACJ96NKX-TG2257 needs to be recalled!: I originally initiated a search online looking for a battery because my phone loses the charge after only about 30 minutes and takes at least a day and a half to recharge. I thought that it was just time to replace the battery until I read the other reviews and realized that others were having the same problem that I am having. When I actually stop and think about it, I have been experiencing problems with this phone since I purchased it. When I first purchased the phone, I had a 30 minute conversation and then had to place the phone back on the cradle to recharge and it took about a day and a half! I thought it was because I didn't let it charge completely initially, so I left it on the charger for 3 days without using it and then when I did use it I had the same problem. I think that Panasonic owes everyone who bought this ""phone"" a refund."

__label__2,"tons of information: Open this book and go on a journey across the world in search on the most Dangerous Creatures. The book has 3 chapters. Chapter One is Tooth and Claw. Here we learn about predators who use their teeth and claws such as bears and sharks. Chapter 2 teaches us about venomous creatures such as snakes and jellyfish. Chapter 3 is called small but deadly. This chapter features creaturs like spiders and bees.I liked the fact that at the end of each chapter has a section called Go Further. This section features vocabulary words, websites, and booklists that kids can look for to learn more.This is a great book for kids ages 8-11 interested in animals of all types. They will enjoy the mix of pictures and useful information. The book would even make a great resource for report writing"
__label__2,"High quality product. I'll highly recommend it.: Great product, we tried most functions already and love it.This is our second DeLonghi toaster/oven. First one was still working after seven years, we just wanted an upgrade."
__label__1,"Expected More: If you have no clue about basic nutrition, this book is for you. If you are a healthy eater and a pretty well informed person, you don't really have to get this book unless you want confirmation that you're doing all the right things."
__label__1,"Average Read - Borrow it - Don't Buy it: This book is for entertainment purposes only. If you are looking for a good book to read, this is not it. The writing was very simple and the plot predictible. Was not worth the purchase of $15.00 that I paid."
__label__2,"Insightful book ....if Only!: Just finished reading such an inspiring book by Wally Amos. My husband and I have been self employed since we have been married (32 years now). I so thoroughly connected with the wonderful advice Wally spoke of. His personality reminded me so much of my husbands who also is a great one for turning lemons into lemonade. After visiting the ""chip and cookie"" website I must say Geez I know Christine must be a loving and strong women in her own right. It just would have been nice had she also been African American"
__label__1,"Could have done better: I was given this for a Christmas gift, but I think the money could have been better spent on a regular weight bench and free weights. I would have used that much more than I do this thing. It really does not give me the workout that I was used to having. The equipment is rather sturdy for what you spend, but I don't think you get enough of a workout for the money you spend. As for the DVD that came with it....it really sucked big time! The mouths didn't match up with the video itself which was VERY distracting. The video reminded you of an old 1960 instructional video. All in all, I was was VERY disappointed in the merchandise. I will be going back to my Tae-Bo and look to buy a real weight set and bench for a true workout. All in all, save your money!"
__label__1,"I loved ""Bees"" but...: I loved ""Bees,"" but this storyline was *all* over the place. The characters were unrealistic. The use of mermaid lore was corny and haphazard. The prose was trite. At times the descriptions of the ocean and the landscape were so cheesy it make me wince. I didn't like the content of the story -- the ending was a HUGE disappointment -- but content aside, the entire reading experience was unejoyable for me. I felt like Monk Kidd phoned this one in."
__label__1,"Fantastic movie, horrible DVD: Everyone should know this is a fantastic movie in every way. And nothing brings it to the screen better than Superbit. But why, tell me why o why, would they cut the movie in the middle of a scene, so close to intermission? The movie is spread onto 2 DVDs, and instead of cuttting at intermission, a perfect time to interupt the movie, they do it a little before. This interrupts a beutiful viewing of a fantastic movie, and without reason."
__label__1,"Book's title is misleading.: The book's title is very misleading. The title implies that it covers the entire workflow process, but it does not. The book provides some very interesting case studies, from the perspective of a working cinematographer, and if you're just interested in shooting digital, the content will be quite informative. If you are looking for some more specific information on the post production process, such as editing digital content, and distribution, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
__label__2,Excellent.: One of the three Chieftains DVDs that are actually concerts instead of documentaries. Breathtaking - I've watched it dozens of times.
__label__2,"It Never Loses Its Thrill.: It helps that I am a Heinlein fan. That said, is isn't as if every book he has ever written has been a masterpiece. This book, however, it one of them. Heinlein develops these characters into people I want to know in real life. He also introduces the amazing Hazel, who reappears later in The Rolling Stones and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls.I recommend this book to anyone who is wondering which book to give to a non-fan. I also highly recommend a reread for anyone who hasn't read it in years. It definitely did not lose any of its genius or joy in the years since I read it last."
__label__1,"Not worht the money: I tried this straightener twice and do not like it at all!! I liked that the straightener had a temp dial and didn't expect t have to use it on high all the time, but I do. The outside of the straightener heats up pretty much the same as the plates on the inside which means the only place to hold it is on the handle. Most other straighteners have an area you can put your fingers on the open end so you are able to use two hands, this one you can't with out being burned. It is also impossible to get right down to the roots of the hair because the plates are so close to the edge of the straightener that I end up burning my head. I am very disappointed for the price and expected a lot more because it was rated so god online."
__label__2,"Easy to Replace: Cheaper than buying a whole new UPS, but not by much. Since I had two, the savings was worth it.The replacement process was very easy. No need to power off to do the swap. With one UPS, the old battery had swelled making it a bit tough to come out, but not overly hard. New batteries slid in fine. Whole operation was done in less than five minutes for each UPS."
__label__1,"meh, it's dull: It started out well, but the longer it went on, the less interesting I found the story line. The vengeful werewolf idea was appealing, but I don't like the way the book skipped from the different character POVs. I also found the writing acceptable, but not extraordinary. The romance was also pretty crappy. IMHO."
__label__1,"Meaningless self-important drivel: If you're wondering why Ron Rubin's books have such high ratings from readers on this site, I can tell you why. He ""teaches"" a class at St. Louis University, and in that class, he requires his students to write a review about his ""books"" as an assignment. I happen to know this because, unfortunately, I wasted my time taking his class. Trust me, he's even more annoying in person than he is in his bad writing. Don't waste your time reading anything this guy writes. Just as I did, you'll wish you had that time (and money) back."
__label__1,"Everyday Sun Magic: I was very disappointed with this book, having been a practicing witch since 14 and yes we are now in a 24,000 year sun cycle. working with the sun doing magic can be very powerful and liberating. this book offered nothing new and to me was just another book filled with new age nonsense."
__label__1,"The only DVD I've ever thrown away: I bought this DVD because of the genuinely funny picture of Allen in his Castro outfit on the cover. Believe me, that's the biggest laugh you're gonna get from this clunker. It appears to have been shot on Super-8 by a rank amateur and the waaaay dated humor (sorry, Howard Cosell is NOT funny) falls as flat as a set of Firestone tires. If this is funny, then I'm Groucho Marx. Not just bad, but incredibly bad. I was embarrassed to watch it -- and I was alone! This one begged for a one-way ticket to the nearest landfill. I was happy to oblige."
__label__1,"Even Patrick Stewart couldn't save it: This is a video showing footage of the different satellite landings on the various planets in our system. However, you won't find that. The footage is a mixture of artist renditions and poor computer graphics. Additionally, the poor writing, *really* bad music (Yoko Ono meets Gustav Holst), and Patrick Stewart sounding angry having to read such a bad script made this a poor rendition of ""In Search Of.""We thought we'd found some great footage to share with our children, but what we found was Barbarella's vision of the planets and middle-school level cinematography (spliced together artist renditions and inferior computer animations).The build up of the movie on the cover falsely portrays what you will really find, so please don't waste your time. Please don't waste your honest wages on this movie. Please, please, please don't go there."

__label__1,"went through 2; didn't work.: My first EarForce X2 didn't work-- the connection to the mic input on the controller is flimsy (they call it ""lightweight"" in the documentation).I returned it and got another. This time the connection worked, but even at max volume, it was about 1/5 as loud as my standard XBox Live Headset. Nobody online could hear me unless they cranked their volume way up.The instructions say to try removing the windscreen, turning the mic in other directions, and so on. That got me up to about 1/4 my standard volume.I guess if you aren't going to be using the mic, these are decent."
__label__1,"Don't waste your money: I have copies of Hoyle bridge games from the past and bought this program because it promised so much. But they are promises not kept. It is basically the same program that you can buy from Staples or Office Depot at their $10 kiosks. They throw in a deck of cards and a score sheet. It says it plays duplicate bridge but I couldn't find it. The help files are not compatible with Vista. I was unable to locate the advertised ""hints"" that are supposedly available. And try to get some information from their web site. Actually, try to find their web site. If you find their web site, try to contact them for support. It's a hassle, if not impossible. If you want the game, buy the cheaper edition. Same program. Same game. Buy your own cards and scoresheet."
__label__1,"That's 90 Minutes I'm not getting back of my life: It was the daily special for 99 cents, so I figured I'd try watching this movie. Wow, I can't believe this all star cast would bother with a third movie that was this unfunny and unoriginal. At least I didn't pay movie theater prices to see this junk."
__label__2,"A good foundational Alef-bet tool: This book is good in that it teaches consonants and vowel points simultaneously. Instead of teaching the letters alphabetically, it teaches them as they appear in several brachot, first the blessing over wine and then the blessing over candles. So, you're learning to read by reading written Hebrew. You're learning nikkudot at the same time you learn the alef bet, so you can pronounce anything in the siddur by the time you're finished. As a plus, it also instructs you on how to pronounce the Name when reading a prayer. We've been using this with a class of adults for several years and now even those who didn't have a Hebrew education as children can read from the siddur. This book is not meant to teach vocabulary or grammar."
__label__2,"Now I understand the battle of the trees--: I earn my living as a social scientist but I have a strong background in biological science. My reading has included scientific works by Strauss, Needham, Mauss, and others--and I read the Golden Bough by Frazier and the White Goddess by Groves when I was in graduate school. When I read Friedman's ""Hidden Book in the Bible"", then ""Who Wrote the Bible"" and then to the ""Disappearance of God"" I experienced a flood of illumination. Then I read ""Noah's Flood"" and had another flash of insight. A year or so ago I was visiting the John Muir Woods north of San Francisco. As my son and I walked through the magnificent redwoods, he asked me why I was whispering. I said, ""Because this is a cathedral."" I mentioned this to my friend who is Nez Perce. She said, ""Yes."" Now I see through a glass darkly."

I was concerned about the speakers not having a grill over the front, but they are not delicate little pieces of paper.The sound quality is excellent, and the remote control works very well, complete with a line-in jack (so you can plug in your iPod without having to plug something in to the computer) and headphone jack."

The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break. Mine broke within 2 days. I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product."
__label__1,"Too bad I couldn't give it a zero: I really have to disagree with the other reviewers here. I find this book to be totally insensitive to children with disabilities. It is filled with discussion about what Howie ""can not do at all"" and though he does manage to push his wheelchair by himself eventually, he is still depicted as a quite depressed, pathetic little boy. I can't help but think that if people are praising Howie Helps Himself, that they must have never had the opportunity to see the many positive examples of books which include characters with disabilities. Try Seal Surfer by Michael Foreman instead."

But getting them on DVD would be better. I would want all 12 seasons!!!"

We have rented Popeye more times than any other movie. We couldn't buy it before now because it is a hard movie to find - but not any more. Finally I hope to add this film to our 300 movie collection. AND DONT LISTEN TO THE CRITIC'S they don't know what they are missing. I guess they have no ""Imajiganation."""

Take it from someone who used to be on an M1A1, during Desert Storm, this game rocks, brought back some memories.You can even make up your own missions, use the missions that come with the game, and play them against real people over the internet.So if you want to see what it is like to be inside an M1A1, during the heat of a battle, ""minus the closed in feeling, lol"" then this game is for you."

We could release the unicorn in some wildlife preserve in Louisiana, to scare the hell out of Bobo & the Finding Bigfoot team. As for Rodman...well, I'm sure the racist, purity-obsessed Stalinist-feudal dictatorship of the DPRK is just the place for Mr. Bad As I Wanna Be.Although I frankly doubt it."

__label__2,Ron's best work yet: Ron's writting is precise and to the point. In all of his books he communicates ideas in a way that a shift in one's point of view is clearly avilable. A shifted point of view leds to shifts in one's actions and one's ways of relating. It has impacted my life tremendously. I consider The Handbook for the Third Millennium to be Ron's best work so far.
__label__1,"What a waste of money!: I registered for this, dispite the warnings from all the mothers I knew who had tryed one. No matter how often I emptied it,it always smelled. It was hard to use, and hard to explain how to use to older people. It doesn't hold that many diapers, the refills are expensive, and a pain to put in. Save your self a head ache and just buy a cheap pail with a lid. I finally did after 10 months of smells, and now my bathroom is breathable again. My best freind is now expecting and wants to find out for herself about the diaper genie myth, so I'm giving her mine. But I'll buy her a diaper pail."
__label__1,"What are these good reviews all about?: Naturally I bought this item because of all of the great reviews on here. Now that I have it and have used it, I am very, VERY confused. It does NOTHING. Every single noise can still be perfectly heard: All traffic, all neighbors, my tiny dog scratching his whiskers....everything. It does not ""fill the room"" and is, in fact, so faint, no matter how high the thing is adjusted (which the so called ""settings"" are somewhat of a joke) even right by my HEAD it makes little difference.White noise, obviously, needs to be at a certain volume to be of any use. At this rate, you may as well try and listen for your refrigerator's motor. I am totally confused by the outlandish price for what is the volume equivalent of a small fan. What else can I say? It's useless. Those who love this thing must live in the country and are hoping to drown out the sound of a distant cricket. For those of us in the big cities, this will not do."
__label__1,"Product was OK--a little boring: The product was ok. However, I had a HUGE problem with ecom. First, your website does not give a confirmation page to proof before you submit your order. When I got the email confirmation a few minutes later, it showed I ordered 2 DVD's instead of 1! I immediately phoned a representative at ecom because the website would not let me make a change to my order because the website said it was already ""processing"". This was within minutes of placing my order. A nice lady I spoke to on the phone said she canceled the entire order for me. But then, about a week later, I received ""2"" DVD's! I went to the return page to return the extra DVD, but it said I could only replace the extra DVD with the same item, not return it. So now I have received and paid for 2 DVD's when I only ordered one! I will never do business with ecom again! I'm sure this review will never be posted."
__label__1,Boring: The product review did not live up to the hype. I kept waiting for something to happen... still waiting. The hero was too judgemental and the heroine was not convincing in her pursuit. Come on...this could have been a much better book if the plot line was flushed out properly.

This is probably the best programming I've seen on TV in a very long time. I'm usually not a big fan of the various TV dramas, but this one is great. I rented the first 4 episodes from Blockbuster, and after watching them, returned to buy the entire series...and finished it in 3 days. :)Suspense, drama, action, mystery, thriller, and even a smattering of comedy. My only problem now is that I haven't seen the beginning of the second season, so now I'll have to wait for September to get the entire collection and watch it before the third season.Good show!!"
__label__2,"This Program is AWESOME!: Ed Gray is a master of meditation. He guides you step by step through a program of spiritual awakening and relaxation that is better than anything I have ever tried before! I have tried numerous other self -improvement/meditation programs and found them to be lacking. They were either too simplistic or so complicated you would have to be a Zen master to figure them out. Ed Gray takes a down to earth yet deeply spiritual approach to lead the listener on a journey to true empowerment. Not only do you get a system by which to wash the troubles of the day away, you get a true conduit to communication with God. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to lead a healthier more spiritual life!"
__label__2,"One of the Best: This is my favorite of the Three Kingdoms games. It isn't as complex as the later editions but is definitely an upgrade over the original two. The ability to create your own generals and ruler adds welcome difficulty to the game as well as adding that personal touch if you like to see your own name flash across the screen. Overall, the game is fun to play, complex enough to keep your interest yet not overload you with options and things you have to remember to build up your cities/troops etc. If you are into these types of games, RTK III is definitely one to check out."
__label__1,"Please pull thisone from the shelves!!: Well, this little book will be pulled from the shelves soon. No one will ever know the extent of the damage this man did or the number of children he touched. I am disgusted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
__label__2,"Great Filtration: Wasn't sure if it would work with my fridge since it had a PUR 4396841 in it that said ""do not use with fast fill"" but after calling Whirlpool, they assured me it would work just fine with my model. The people who sold me the fridge told me not to use the 4396710P but apparently they didn't know what they were talking about or just wanted to sell me their replacement at an inflated price (always check with the manufacturer when in doubt). Great price & great performance. Don't pay retail at Loews or Home Depot!"
__label__2,Dr. Good: Dr. No Has Some Exciting Parts To It. But All In All It's A Not Good But Not Bad James Bond Movie. I Agree Seeing The Living Daylights Or Octopusst Instead.
__label__1,"It's okay, but sometimes gets boring....: The graphics are excellent on my labtop, but not on my XP. The show jumping is quite challenging. And its sometimes gets boring when you do the same thing each day. It is nothing like the movie.I liked it because there is a lot of horses to pick from. You can't make your horse look like Sonya because the color on the game is lighter than Sonya."
__label__2,"More Great Hilary Stagg!: If you like harp and/or New Age music, titles by Hilary Stagg are for you. In addition to this album, I also own Dream Spiral and Sweet Return. Beautiful harp playing. Definitely satisfies the harp lover in you!"
__label__2,"Plays, Weddings, and Natives: Ike finds himself enthralled by the Royal Candaian Weding, and stays home to watch it. This leads to a series of events in which he is unable to continue a play at school and where he needs to go to Canda. Kyle finds himself filling in for Ike and doing the play, but no one seems to be able to do anything right.This episode has been one of the better ones in a while, and I think that says a lot. In Season 14, I found myself a little bit on or off BUT here, in 15, everything seems to be going well. I personally like the detour to the little kids in this, and I like the Canadian storyline. It has something in it for everyone, plus it takes its shot at the Royal Wedding well in the televised comments.The VOD on this is pristine, making it worth watching. And this season has been great, and only gets better. I think a 5/5 is justly deserved, with me never wanting to have to scrape off pudding or deal with an arm like the Royals have to."

DO NOT BUY ANY OLEVIA PRODUCT. I TRIED TO CALL THE 800 NUMBER AND REC'D THE RCORDING SAYING THEY NO LONGER SERVICE ANY PRODUCTS. IF YOU GO TO THEIR WEB SITE, THEY ONLY SEEM TO LIST OFFICES IN HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE. APPARENTLY THE PRODUCT WAS SO BAD THEY HAVE PULLED THE PLUG AND ARE NO LONGER IN THE US.DO NOT BUY........"
__label__1,very disappointed: i will not buy any more side by side 3ds.there was ghosting and it was just like if you use the 3d button on your control to change from 2d to 3d. do not waste money on the side by side. i did not return it for the ghosting because i have had bad luck with a few others and didn't want to return too many.
__label__2,"Very pleased.: The duvet cover was nice and exactly what I wanted but, the best was the service by ecom. The first one I ordered was lost and ecom sent me another right away. It was my first order from ecom and the service was exceptional and prompt. I would certainly order something else from them. Oh, I forgot to mention they had the item which I couldn't find anywhere!"
__label__1,"Not right for kids: I purchased this book after taking a course in signing for my twins. I was looking for a short book with basic signs that we could use everyday. The publisher seems to have missed the mark on what signs kid would want or need in a simple signing book. For example the section titled ""Snacks and Food"" has 42 signs, but doesn't have the word vegetable, or any sign for any vegetable. Instead, what they do have is a section of 30 signs on religion, including such everyday usage words for children as ""resurrection"", ""missionary"", and ""devil"". A number of words in this category are helpful including ""God"", ""church"", and ""prayer"", but for the most part the book has a lot of words that adults think children should learn and not nearly enough words that children would use everyday. My suggestion would be to buy a real dictionary from a different publisher that has all the words you will be looking up."
__label__2,"brilliant, maybe their best, which says a lot: RATM-band of the decade. This album definately has more funk then there first one and a little more then their second. I was impressed. I don't think that with modern day music taste, there will be many more hits then ""GUERRILLA RADIO"" but for previous rage fans, that probably won't even be their favorite song. All of these songs rock! Morello's a genius. Zach is Rage itself. RATM is my favorite band but my one problem is that Zach is pretty hard to understand when you're not reading the lyrics. That's not good for all of their politics-which I generally support. Limp BIzkit and Kid Rock are nothing compare to Rage."
__label__2,"great package!: This package is definately worth the price. I got it for my palm and couldn't stop playing it. If you are ever bored in meetings or just sitting around the house, this is a great way to have some fun. Me and my kids love it. It is just like the shooting games at the arcade. I would definately recommend it. If you liked this one I would also recommend the 100 great games for the palm."
__label__1,"Wow, people actually bought this horrible thing.: Renting this rip-off riding on the coat tails of the success of Paranormal Activity, I wasn't expecting much. Maybe a laugh or two. I ended up fast forwarding through most of this mess. Don't waste your time. The dialogue was ridiculous (not that I could hear half of what the actors said since the audio was so poor), the acting was no better, and the ""scares"" felt forced and were so badly timed it was painful. I shouldn't even waste more of my time reviewing this movie, but I should at least warn the hapless suckers who might be fooled into thinking this is a quality film."
__label__2,"What Price Glory?: I have only listened to part of the title song, Lagrimas Negras; I gave it 4 stars. Went to buy the CD and was asked $25. I refuse to shell out this much for a CD which in addition has the names Tata Guines and Changuito associated with it; I suspect some royalties end up in Fidel Castro's pockets. Back to the material itself, I did not like some carelessness with the lirics on the part of Sigala; if he did not know the words, certainly other cuban born personnel should have intervenned."
__label__1,"Not for fans of more simplistic art: This was one book that I wouldn't have bought if I had ""browsed"" thru it in a book store. We are new to scrollsawing and therefore were buying various pattern books for ideas and such. The word ""artistic"" in this book's title should have tipped me off; the majority of the patterns are quite ""artsy"" by which I mean they are a little too odd for me; pretty modern stuff. I seem to favor patterns like those of Judy Gale Roberts."
__label__2,"Kelly Osbourne Has Arrived!!: Kelly Osbourne is a very talented young lady. It's amazing how versatile she is. Very impressive album with catchy songs. Her age does not matter. Ozzy and Sharon should be proud!! You go girl, keep rockin'!! Let no one hold you back or tell you anything negative!"
__label__2,"I love Bucky: What can I say, I'm a sucker for Bucky and Sachel. This book is a compilation of past strips that are wonderfully hilarious."
__label__2,"Great Soundtrack: This is a classic 80's horror soundtrack, which utilizes the Roland Juno/Jupiter 6 to great extent. Some of the tracks were also used in the 80's horror film ""Monster Dog."""
__label__1,"Great Series, Bad DVD: Shame on you Anime Works! You decide to get rid of your overstock by re-releasing all 5 volumes in one set at basically 1/5 the cost. For anyone who dosen't already own these I guess its great. Also its a lesson to people like myself.... DONT BUY DVDS THE FIRST TIME AROUND. just wait a couple years for the re-relase and get them dirt cheap. They just better release the rest of the series at the same price point.... Grrr..."
__label__1,"Smaller Than It Looks: When I received the holster bag, I was surprised at how much smaller it is than it looks online. It does not fit my Canon 50D very well with the lens attached to it. I had to struggle to zip the bag up. Don't forget that the straps need to go in the bag also. I also realized that I do not have room to put in my carry on flash in the holster. I have returned this item and plan to buy a bigger holster bag. This may be OK for smaller DSLR cameras thoughs."
__label__2,outstanding author: I like Barbara cleverly's books very much.Each is like a tour to adifferent time and place. Joe sandiland reminds me of Richard Jury--one of my favorites.
__label__1,"Does not work: The dolphins cannot make music when water gets in them, which is constantly. The rings do not stay linked together. The dolphins are cute & my 1-year-old enjoys dunking a dolphin & watching bubbles come out the top of the toy, but that's about it. Very poorly designed."
__label__1,"didn't work. inconsistent weights all the time: I was really looking forward to this item when reading the reviews on here. Seems like most people were satisfied with this product. I am usually an easy to please person but honestly this product did not work for us. After getting weights that were a little off, we decided to just weigh a diaper, then some clothes and a diaper. The clothes + diaper weighed less than the diaper itself. It just didn't make sense. Two times that we weighed her before the doctors office naked, the scale was 3 oz less than the doctor's. The third time we did it, our scale was above the doctor's. And then a fourth time, it was quite off. And this last time, it was under but by just an ounce. It changes all the time. We returned it. Disappointed."
__label__1,"You must be joking: From a 2010 perspective, this movie seems incredibly simplistic and predictable - its main entertainment value, if any, is as camp comedy. The plot ""tension"" is laughable. I (and half a dozen friends) are very sorry that I picked this one from a pile of seven DVDs including Apocalypse Now and Zorba the Greek - both of which I have yet to see.Upon reflection, this movie reminded me of Hawaii Five O or the original Star Trek, in that they were great fun for a kid, but when nostalgia prompts a re-watching, they don't compare well to modern, more sophisticated fare.Some of the classics still are great. If you really are in the mood for a submarine movie, watch Das Boot (subtitled, not dubbed). Outstanding."
__label__1,"Not the quality I was looking for: I purchased this microphone & I am returning it the same day. I was looking for a microphone that would work with my pc & had a little better quality than the standard ones you get with a new computer. Sound coming from this was so lo, windows couldn't even detect a voice being transmitted.Can't complain too much, it was less than $10. I have not tried this product with other devices. I use my pc for all of my recording."
__label__1,"A terrible program: After this product caused chkdsk to run so many times at reboot, I was glad to get this thing off my PC. Also, it does not perform according to options selected, removing items as it sees fit, and it does not propose individual actions before performing them, even though it claims it will. It does not log what changes it does make, and it seems to make no difference at all in my PC's performance. It did free up memory, but it took so long to do it, it wasn't practical anyway. If I could give 5 stars for junk, this product would earn them, rating first in lack of utility; first in destructive performance; first in lack of user control, first in lack of documentation; and first in cost-uselessness."
__label__2,"A good RPG: This RPG Has STYLE!!! It uses a lot of mathematical skills in calculating damage and pinpointing where the enemy is at what time. I have to say that the A.I. is excellent. Also The overall graphics amaze me. Evolution 1 was really short, but Evolution 2 has the best quality gameplay i have seen since Chrono Trigger!Evolution 2 Will Get 5 Stars anyday!"
__label__1,Crappy ending: The story was good although it was hard to keep all the characters straight. The ending didnt tie up anything and left all the stories hanging.
__label__2,"Next on my list: As i purchased several at one time to replace older worn out versions, it's next on my list to re-read. I love the story, and using ecom makes it easier to replace as I come across one it's time to replace!"
__label__1,"Waste of time and money: I knew about the death worms from the writings of the real Indiana Jones, Roy Chapman Andrews. I was hoping for a decent adventure tale, instead I got this piece of crap that had to have been written on toilet paper. When you think of Mongolia you think of deserts, so why was it filmed on Texas grasslands instead of Death Valley or Arizona? The local Mongolian lawman looked and sounded like a Texas sheriff. This movie is so unspeakably bad and disappointing on so many levels I can't believe it.(At least it wasn't filmed in Romania like High Plains Invaders!)This movie is the most expensive coaster I'll ever put my drinks on."
__label__1,"Never tried night photos?? You should now.: This is the most helpful book on night photography I have found. I took a class in which all my assignments were to be done at night and so I searched for info. I have Frost's Low Light and Night book, it left me wanting. Low light is not the same as night photography. Sanderson is easy to follow and his night shots are amazing. The exposure chart is what you really need. I have it laminated and in both of my camera bags. This is TRUE photography at night."
__label__2,"One of the better eBay books: This book targets people looking to make a full-time living selling on eBay. It is not targeted at buyers or infrequent sellers. The book does a good job of presenting information and it has a number of great tips that will benefit any seller. Infrequent sellers will have to wade through a lot of business strategy text to uncover the most valuable tips. Overall, it was one of the better eBay books I read.After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:---Beginner with eBay and computers---1. The Official eBay Bible---eBay Seller---1. Sell it on eBay2. eBay Hacks---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---1. eBay Strategies2. eBay Business the Smart Way"
__label__1,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DESIGN AND NOT FUNCTIONAL: I've had these earphones for two days and I am sending them back. What a complete waste of my time and energy. They simply do not work as advertised. Not in the least. I hardly took two stokes before water came gushing into the ear and headphones, completely muting all sound. There is no listening to music with these in the water, just the pain of plastic wrapped tightly around your head. Do not waste your time trying to get them to work, as I tirelessly did. It's clear that there was no 'human testing' with these and the engineers clearly designed them on paper and not in the water. They are good in theory and absolutely worthless in practice. That said, there are some new designs coming out that outmatch these crappy things on every level."
__label__1,"A Nasty Film: The Human Centipede was just nasty, and I am upset that I continued to watch it. I was hoping for it to get better, but it didn't. It was not scary...just NASTY!!! Please find something else to watch."
__label__1,"The worst of it's genre: Not even worth the 1-cent price shown above at the used shops. This book is the very worst of a plethora of cute career related drivel which has flooded bookshelves since the mid eighties. It reads exactly like what it is - a book basically written (probably in a single weekend) so its author, a professional ""consultant,"" could cash in on the endless supply of bosses who buy such tripe so they can leave it in the break room for real employees to read while waiting for their lunch to cook in the microwave. Full of obvious and pointless advice like ""Take courses at your community college."" or ""Never get drunk at your office holiday party."" this book is an insult to anyone who actually works for a living. I would give this turd less than one star if I could."
__label__2,".: i must have had this since the first week of its release. my dad got 2 for free somehow, and this thing can take a beating.

__label__1,"Doesn't work: Bought this DVD for my niece, she received it but it doesnt work in any of her media players... Blank disk. Besides that she likes the cover and enjoys showing it to her friends... I told her the whole story to compensate for the fact that I got her excited to watch it, but then again when I was a kid people didn't sell people blank discs... Anywho, I emailed the seller and got no response."
__label__2,"Great kick start to using words!: My son loves this book! It came as a 1st birthday present from a friend who said her son loved this book.The pages are sturdy and easy to turn. The pictures are great, and very appealling to a little one. It seemed like every time he opened the book, he saw something new.The pages will rip out. This is not a book that is meant to be a ""bookshelf only"" book. I didn't mind that he ripped some pages out. Most of the time it was because he was trying to get to the page he loved most. The book also has a spiral binding, which makes it a little easier to rip the pages...however, it does make it easier for those little fingers to get used to turning pages one at a time.This is an EXCELLENT gift for a first birthday or a nice treat for your toddler....Don't be surprised if this books goes everywhere with you!"
__label__1,"Defective: I agree with the other reviewers that this is a defective coffee maker, since the metal plate surrounding the control buttons does not leave enough clearance around the buttons, and therefore they stick. I went to the store and checked out the display model, and its buttons were stuck also!The machine also makes weak coffee, since you need to use much more coffee beans than recommended to get a decent tasting cup of coffee. The grinder does not have the capacity needed to hold all of the beans required.Needs improvement regarding the above issues, but it's very pleasing aesthetically. It would also be good if it had a thermal carafe."

__label__1,"Terrible movie: I'm not going to say much cause theirs not much to say. But I will tell you that the live action RE movies went really downhill after apacolypse. Their's really no plot in this movie, just pointless mess. The acting sucks and they did a really good job screwing the live action series. Please don't buy this trash."

__label__2,"Perfect size for bath!: This is the perfect size for the bath. The handle is just the right size and length for good control, and the squeegie portion is great at getting the water off the shower walls. The suction holder makes it really convenient as well!I don't understand how a reviewer thought the handle is too short of course unless he/she is REALLY short or is using this for a vehicle windshield. This really is specifically made for the bath."
__label__1,"too many arts and crafts: As a mental health therapist, I found this book to be very hands on and not as appropriate for a therapuetic setting."
__label__1,"Don't waste your money!: This unit went dead within a week of receiving it. I contacted customer service and received an RMA# from ""Jose Gonzalez"" along with instructions on returning the unit. I shipped the unit by UPS, someone at the company signed for it, and I never heard anything else from them (this was over a year ago). They refuse to answer any e-mails, and their customer service number has appaently been disconnected. Over $100 down the drain....DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY (GoVideo)!!!!!!"
__label__1,"From Classy to Trashy: In their first 2 albums, Destiny's child tried to show some class and not act ridiculous, but with the release of ""Survivor"" and now this album, they have become trashy. I blame mostly Beonce since she had more creative control over these albums than the previous 2. This CD tries to hard to fit in with the R&B culture of today. Watching these girls trying their hardest to be ""ghetto"" in the videos is just sad. Definitely don't waste your money."
__label__1,hate it: I have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies.. and I hate it... I feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history...
__label__1,"Embarrassing!: I'm embarrassed I bought this DVD.But in all fairness to the band, this DVD is unauthorized. From what I've read the band does not want this released, but since the company who staged this event owns the rights to the performance, they can legally sell copies. But I'm sure the band is getting paid, or I'm sure Gene would have sicked his lawyers on them. The ""bonus"" material is interesting but could have been edited. I'm assuming the company in question is trying to recoop some money lost on this event."
__label__1,"don't buy this product: i bought two. one stuck right at the end of the game, and the other was worse. i gave it as a Xmas gift, and when she unwrapped the DVD package inside the box, there was no DVD!Unbelievable"

__label__1,"Worst movie in years: I haven't seen such a negative, sub-standard movie in years. The preview looked great but I don't think I laughed once while watching the real thing."
__label__1,"shallow, politically -correct, and not funny: What boring, superficial stuff! I could pick up better and more interesting and funnier impressions of a place by driving through it at sixty miles an hour than this deadbeat can by hanging around for a week!"
__label__2,"A classic must-read: THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is an absolute gem. I intent to re-read to pick up on more of the symbolism. What I found especially refreshing was the depth, yet simplicity of the narrative. Absolutely gorgeous, and nothing ""phony"" about it. The prose served to methodically hammer the themes and symbolism of the book into the brain- but its simplicity makes it an especially good choice for summer reading for school. No ten syllable words to try to wrap your brain around on break! I have nothing bad to say about the book... except that some people might find language and turn of phrase objectionable. Personally, I felt like it served to enhance the feeling that you were inside a teenage boy's mind without being overly graphic- nothing like it could have been, in today's world! To make a long story short, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a completely rivetting book that everyone should read, whether or not they usually enjoy reading."
__label__1,"A DUMB POLITICAL MADE UP DOC: How can anyone label this very dumb movie as ""Great"" or ""Accurate"" when they were not even there. This is another flic where Damon is using his celebrity status to pan America and Bush. When are you left wingers going to move on - especially you DAMON? I and many other vets have lost all respect for this Damon guy because he shows his contempt for this country to put a story like this on the screen because their are always people that will really believe it. Give it a rest. If this war was all about oil why aren't the gas prices down instead of going up? I and many more will never see another Damon movie again."
__label__2,"A compelling read...terrible event and beautifully told: I read this after reading ""Unbroken"" by Laura Hillenbrand, which is the best book I've ever read, and this book is also fantastic. What a tale of courage & strength by our WWII men. Very inspiring."
__label__2,Medical dictionary: I am a patent translator and translate from time to time medical-technical patents. This dictionary gives not only the translations of the specific terms but also a short explanation of the meaning of the term in question. Very helpful for my work.
__label__1,"Murder Music: If you like music that advocates killing gays and lesbians, this has a number of bloodthirsty tracks. In Damn, Beenie Man sings ""I'm dreaming of a new Jamaica, come to execute all the gays"". In Roll Deep, he urges people to take up bazookas to kill gays. Capleton and Sizzla also encourage murder in their songs! Perfect to listen to with mom![...]"
__label__2,"Chillingly beautiful: I have never called myself a fan of Sarah. Hearing her songs for years on the radio left me irritated - they were too perfect, too measured, too polished. But ""Mirrorball"", which I bought on pure faith, is absolutely incredible! The elements combined - the audience, the backup music and singers, Sarah's effortlessly husky and lilting voice make for a haunting play.Something that is missing in her studio-recorded songs comes alive in her live performance for ""Mirrorball"". It's a gorgeous, textured fingering of what usually dies or goes unnoticed in some overly perfect attempts at music.I want more!"
__label__1,"Poor form: I considered buying this book until I explored the reviews. All of the ""5-star"" reviews are clearly written by the authors themselves or their publicists. Nearly every review points out a different potential audience ... lesbians, therapists, the old, the young ... even men (which helps substantiate the weird title). Even the structure of each review is similar -- each ""reviewer"" reveals something about her- or himself, makes a positive comment, then a final ""buy this book!"" testimonial.When I decided to read other reviews by each reviewer, this book tended to be the only one ever commented on. When there WAS another book, it was typically the author's previous book.I am so disappointed by the authors' self-aggrandizement and dishonesty that I will not buy this book or any other by them.Two people wrote poor reviews of the book. I will say that I do believe their comments!"

__label__1,"You must be kidding: I simply have to laugh out loud when I read that ""CD quality is not good enough""... Good enough for what? For the kind of hiss-drenched recordings of the Neil-Young-at-Canterbury-House type (the one that has just been issued)? Or for the sixties recordings of this first archives batch?For decades we've been told that CDs were the absolute standards, now we find they're no good, not even for reissuing analogic recordings dating 30, 40 years ago...Come on, you MUST be joking..."

__label__2,"Great bag, period: My friends and I meet up to play WoW together from time to time and I wanted a bag to carry my laptop in as well as the power chords and my mouse. Not only were the colors appealing (Horde colors), but I liked the idea of a sling bag. It has enough room for my laptop, the chords, and my mouse as well as potential space for a tablet and its odds and ends. It has compartments for various school related supplies as well.It isn't enough to dock a star, but the padding in the strap makes the cell phone pocket a bit snug, it's difficult to get my phone in and out of it, but I'll prob'ly just put my authenticator in there 'cause my pockets are more than capable of carrying my cell phone."

__label__1,"poor remake: An original movie classic trying to be updated but falling far short. The flying ships belong in a comedy and they turned this classic into a ship of fools instead of adding more clearity and better film coverage. ecom is as always great, but this movie was a flop."
__label__2,"Shere perfection: I agree with Hedgman. A little pricey but an absolute work of art. Incredible weight in the hand, beautiful finish, design so simple yet so effective. Opening wine bottles has never been so easy. I will never need to buy another. I am complete."
__label__2,Memorex Sport Band for Zune: I am glad that I have finaly found a product which will allow me to enjoy my Zune player while I workout without fear of the strap kinking up like so many other sport bands do. This product has a wide and thick sport band which will keep your player snug against your arm once attached to your arm.

Haven't yet taken the bikes on a long trip, but the 10 miles at highway speed I have taken them, the bike were secure and silent. The mount lock is far superior to any cable lock and the included hitch pin lock was a nice addition. I am very pleased with this product."
__label__2,Great Debate Book: I bought this book for a writing class and am glad that I got to read it. Hertsgaard makes many good points about America's role in the world. Thought there are some things that you will disagree about every thing gets you really thinking. Really take the time to read the book and it would even be better if you got someone else to read the book at the same time to talk about what is said in the book.

__label__2,"deja entendu... same band.. new sound: Although at first listen this cd hardly sounds like traditional brand new quality... if you give it a chance... it could end up being the kind of cd ""that makes people glad to be where they are... with whoever they're there with"" (ok i believe you, but my tommy gun dont). the songs on this cd dont have the uptone beat of YFW... but the gradual build and eventual heavy sound of the songs on deja is uncomparable to any other artist. The lyrics too developed from the primere album... showing signifigantly more maturity.. and taking on many new themes. This cd is one of the best buys of the year... and cant be missed."

__label__2,"Great product: This is a great product, it is easy to put together and take apart, cleans easily and is quiet. It does leave more of the greens behind than I expected but it did well. After I have juiced the veggies, I put the juice in a blender with fruit mix it and a great smoothie is made. I would recommend this product."

__label__1,"Pretentious shallow load of steaming crap: I was already bored with the flat generic characters a few chapters into the book, but kept slogging away hoping it would improve eventually. I was sorely disappointed. I'm not sure what offended me more - the Negro kitchen help waving her spoon at everyone, or the contrived grossly unnatural dialogue that was more a space for the author to throw out the name of every artist she'd ever heard of in a disgustingly self-satisfied ""look at how educated I am!"" manner than anything *real* people ever said to each other. The characters were fake, shallow, and boring. There were no outstanding qualities in any of them, or in the book in general, that would make you want to read this title vs ... something that was actually good. I'd give it a Negative million star review if I could, but ecom doesn't let us be honest enough."

__label__2,"Very good if you know the background: I was watching this film who is unware of Steve Coogan's UK television work and as a result we came away with two completely different views of the film. Whilst I found it hilarious finding much of the humour in the sending up of Coogan he failed to see much of the humour simply because they were unware of Alan Partridge much of the fun of this film relies on you knowing who Partridge is. if you found any of the 3 (or 4 if you count ""The Day Today"") Alan Partridge shows funny then you will to. If not then you'll find little in this film.Incidently I notice that the film already seems to have gone out of print (in the US) so if you're wavering on whether to buy it best do it soon before the 2nd hand price rockets"
__label__1,"made motherhood sound depressing: I bought this while pregnant hoping for a light read, and somene to say ""it's really not so bad."". I didn't get that from this book. Instead, I felt the author was constantly whining about every little annoyance with her pregnancy and new parenthood. (Trying to do this humorously is still whining.) From complaining she had no time to herself, to lamenting that it was taking her forever to lose her pregnancy weight. At the end of every chapter, she would write some sort of sappy cliche about her baby, as if that made up for all the previous grousing.This book did nothing to encourage me or make me look forward to being a mom. It did make me dread the birth of my baby, but now that I am 6 months into motherhood, I have found it really ISN'T that bad. :)"

Black and White screen uninspired software.And then it happened, my palm almost ruined me, as I wasnt using my palm because it was terrible and I figured a Pocket Pc was a Palm with a pretty color screen.WAS I WRONG. The pocket pc is INCREDIBLE. Where do I begin? The games are INSANE. Go to Handago.com and look around. Age of Empires looks like a shrunk version of the full one.

I'm returning and hoping to get a refund including shipping both ways. I'm not sure but I think it's missing some pieces. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone."
__label__2,"I like this C.D. so much that I know most of it by heart: I recommend this C.D. to everyone, even if you are not an X-Files fan. I've listened to it many times. It only is music with sometimes people frme the show talking. I rate it five stars."
__label__1,The oracle documentation is better: This book is simply a compilation from the Oracle documentation. I actually preferred the Oracle documents. I didn't gain anything new by buying this book (which I promptly returned).
__label__2,"One of the best!!: Although the editing was horrendous, the story was so excellent and intense that is overshadowed any grammatic problems.The drama in this novel was wild! Ms Campbell laid out a story 3 female friends (or so they thought they were friends) that MAKES a reader glue to the story. It shockingly concentrated with real issues, sadness, feline problems, social issues and just plain life and the cruel hand that some people are dealt."
__label__1,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK: If you're the head of a university, don't get this book at all! You're students will loathe it.

Save yourself a heart attack and look somewhere else for a thermo book."
__label__1,"Doesn't kill weeds.: This product may have benefited the grass, and it did make the dandelions a little droopy, but it wasn't really worth it. I wanted a weed killer that would not harm the lawn. I followed the instructions EXACTLY in addition to following the tips list EXACTLY. The droopy weeds are not dead weeds which means this was not the answer for hearty arizona weeds at all. Maybe wimpy midwest varieties are actually killed.Also, even with the water pressure on a gentle low, the bottle emptied within 5 to 10 minutes, not 20 minutes, so it barely was enough for the front of a very small city yard. And, yes, the problem with the dandelions not being killed is in the area that was sprayed first."
__label__1,"doesn't work: after having two separate watches sent, neither of which worked on arrival, it is safe to say, i would never order this product again. it was a time-wasting paperwork headache. ecom should pull the product from its shelves. ecom seems to take no pride in sending products that have been tested for function."
__label__2,"Awsome: I thought this book was by far the best of the Tawny Man series, not that I did not love the other two. I have not read the other two series by Robin Hobb, but after reading Fool's Fate I was convinced that I wanted to read the other series also, starting at the beginning and then re-reading the Tawny Man series.I thought that the character development was amazing and that you really know the characters... almost enough to guess their favorite color. I loved the developing relationships between the Prince and Elliania, Fitz and Nettle, even Thick and the other characters. The story was intriguing and I was always guessing the true reason for Elliania's challenge to Dutiful. Basically this book gets the position of my favorite book, at least until I stumble upon another great fantasy."

__label__1,"Very adult: I exspected a vampire series, but it is strange short stories. All very explicit with adult situations. Only one story about vampires, very disappointed!"
__label__1,"Terribly messy and ugly.: This book belongs to the past, when people did not know how to write nice biochem. books. Today, we have Matthews et al, Voet, Lehninger... All those books are easy to read and follow, have fantastic illustrations and pedagogcial aids - and do not contradict theselves in every other line. This book may have been the first, once - but it sure was not the last, too, so go and get a more modern account of biochem, in a new and brushed-off format, that you can read also if you do not have a heap of time on your hands!"
__label__1,"Posible future trends: Another case where a good publisher says, ""you have to have a more grabbing title."" Good thoughtful book with potential trends for the future, but weak forcasting of big future trends. More for Canada than the US."

__label__2,A Jonny Whitaker Fan: I have been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd. I think the movie is a good one. Jonny Whitaker was great as Tom Sawyer and Jeff East was good as Huck Fun. All the actors were great. I own the tape and the dvd. I would recommend this movie to every one who likes tom sawyer and musicals.
__label__1,"Bad, low budget, Sci Fi channel type movie: This movie would be perfect for SyFy channel. It is horrible. Lame , Lame, Lame. The characters were ridiculous, storyline and costumes are even worse. I was begging for the movie to end."
__label__2,"Weisman's best work to date--the best read of the summer: I've been a John Weisman fan since the early ROGUE WARRIOR books. (Marcinko may have been the featured attraction, but it was Weisman's writing that made the books so enjoyable.) It's great to see him out from under Marcinko's shadow. And with SOAR, Mr. Weisman has finally proven that he doesn't need anyone to tell a superb and exciting story. I read SOAR in one day--and with it, Weisman has joined the ranks of Clancy, Coonts, Dale Brown, and the best of the techno-thriller writers. All the Weisman trademarks, the ones we loved in the Rogue Warrior novels are here--the author's skill with action scenes, descriptions of the latest cutting edge technology, and the edge-of-the-seat suspense we expect from the genre. Highly recommended, and the best read of the summer."
__label__1,Milking It...: Seems to me the authors of the Left Behind series are milking it for everything it's worth. I've been a loyal fan of the series but The Remnant was very disappointing. It left me wondering how I'd get through another year (and two more books) of the Tribulation.
__label__2,2016 OBAMA'S AMERICA: I found the video to be well written. Mr. D'zouza's theory of Barrack Obama's true identity and political beliefs to be astounding with great insight. A magnificient documentary wielding horrifying accuracy of Obama's past and future. Definitely something for everyone to see before voting in the presidential election.
__label__1,"Save your money!!!: Elmer Smith's new book is as interesting as his dry, uninspired journalistic pieces he has been writing for the last 20 years in the Philadelphia Daily News. I don't understand how Elmer's writing or his view on life is even remotely viewed as humorous, even in a satorical manner. He should stick to writing about boxing and leave the observations of the world to others. I think the only one who is laughing is Elmer Smith - and no one gets it."
__label__2,"A mixture of all fairy tales: I was in the booksotre looking for a book I had never read, when I found Never After. I had been there the day before and it wasn't there so it was almost like magic. I just got through reading it and I think that it was a very very good book. It was a mixture of Cinderella, Rumpelstilskin, Sleeping Beauty, The Princess and the Pea, and The Frog Prince. I just hope that this is made into a movie. You will Enjoy it."
__label__1,"A major disappointment: Vonnegut and Adams are two of my favorite authors, and -- perhaps more importantly -- I loved Bo Fowler's other book, Scepticism, Inc. Very sadly, though, I found The Astrological Diary of God to be tough to even finish. It's too focused on masturbation, the characters are otherwise not very compelling, and the story seems to lose itself halfway through the book. That said, I highly encourage readers who like Vonnegut and similar authors to check out Scepticism, Inc. and, personally, intend to read whatever Bo Fowler publishes next."
__label__2,"Great story, tough point to prove...: Krakauer does a great job of telling the story of Mr. McCandless and relating to similar, past events - including those of his own life. His main goal, it appears, is to tell the story in the context of man's longing for adventure and his desire to interact with nature. Krakauer's biggest challenge, however, is more along the lines of proving McCandless was not an absolute fool - entering Alaska arrogant and unprepared. Regardless, Krakauer is a great writer and this is a fine book. Another great example of non-fiction as literature."
__label__1,terrible: Continues to freeze movie and my TV . Will not purchase streaming movies again. Useless .suggest no one get this .
__label__1,"takes too long for ecom to deliver: My issue is not with the movie. Apparently you can only have a dvd copy there are not digital downloads available for this. So i ordered the video wanting to watch it. It took over 14 days to get the movie. I actually ended going to Hastings and buying because it was taking so long. I couldn't cancel the order, I had to wait for it to be delivered, then they want to charge about half of what movie costs to send it back so i kept it. I have ordered many things from ecom, and have been happy with service from their vendors. I have not been happy with things ordered from ecom itself. It takes them way to long to ship and deliver their merchandise."

I can create a movie with ease, but the rendering process ALWAYS froze up on me! I checked the manufacturers website and MANY other people had the same problem and the same lack of a solution! I changed video drivers, I changed BIOS, I tried switching video cards and it always froze up on me! I came close to throwing this product through the window! You can do better than this...a more complicated interface would be worth avoiding the bigs in this software!You can do better than this!"

I challenge you to not bounce to any song on this album. Roni Size is one of the most talented producers in electronic music. The tracks laced with his loyal reprazent crew are as strong as always aswell as guest appearances by Method Man, The Human Beat Box: Rahzel and the unforgettable collaboration with Zack De La Rocha from Rage Against The Machine. Junglists and Hip Hop fans check it out for yourself."
__label__2,"Had to watch it twice but it was so worth it!: This is a tough movie to watch - no doubt. But there is something about it that grabs you and, at the end, you are left with many questions that the filmmakers do not answer. The answers are left up to the viewer.I watched it twice to see if I could find the answers but had to be satisfied that the information not provided by the movie is not relevant to the story. It just doesn't matter what happened to the boys. The story stays the same...I loved the cat!I would recommend this movie. It is a gay movie and it has to be because I don't think this story would have unfolded the same with straight characters - Different pressures and all. Maybe I am wrong.Visually beautiful with excellent use of silence and subtlety!A great film. I want to watch it again."
__label__2,"Factual and entertaining: This book is unlike many of its genre in that it is actually an interesting read. The author employs many real world examples, which will help the reader recall the material much better at test time than would a simple memorization of facts. The author is also very good at explaining the more subtle aspects of securities laws. In some instances, he presents the set of laws as written in ""legalese"" and follows this with a translation in plain English. Two sample exams are included at the end of the book, so the reader can test his or her memory. I didn't think the exam questions he provided tested the material deeply enough, however, and may give the user a sense of false confidence. I also found both the glossary and the index lacking in that they were both incomplete, making it difficult to locate the discussion on a specific topic I wanted to review."

__label__2,"Second set, still pleased: My wife and kids have been sharing a set for a year so I decided to get my son his own this Christmas. Both sets are holding up well, no noticeable wear. If you're in the market for this type of headphone (light, open, etc) you can't go wrong with these. Great sound. They do fold up but we've found that to be mostly a gimmick."

I would have wanted to know if The filter I purchased is grey market. The filter I received from ecom is a very different color than my other B+W UV filters. I don't purchase filters from ecom.com any more. I am looking very carefully into who sells grey market and who doesn't. Jean
__label__1,"DO NOT waste your money !!!!!!!!: I have thought about ordering this product for 2 years and finally did.I had 11 inches of my colon removed 3 years ago due to diverticulosis. I LOVE popcorn, but since my surgery I had been advised to not eat it, or eat it rarely due to the hulls. I was NEVER more excited after I ordered this product.What I can honestly tell you is this products has is the same amount of hulls as the popcorn I buy at the grocery store for 1/4 the price. The small white popcorn is tender, but the hulls are still there in high volume. So I will NOT be eating it.Order at your own discretion."
__label__1,"Product did not meet expectations: When I opened the package, it was covered in some kind of greasy substance. Had to take out the disc and rinse off the entire case, which now is ruined with water stains. In addition, the disc will not fast forward in my bluray player, I can only skip to the next scene but am unable to fast forward. When I try, the disc freezes. I would have absolutely returned this product had it not been only $10 with shipping. However, This product was not even worth that much."

__label__2,"This is not an overblown product: If you travel to windy places where it rains, this is the umbrella for you. The cheap ""travel"" umbrellas are just that.

__label__1,"DVR Screech: I purchased this DVR 3 years ago. After a couple of weeks it developed this high pitch screech when starting. I didn't mind as long as the player and recorder worked well. About 3 months ago, the player stopped working. So, I did get about 2 1/2 years out of the recorder. However, I will not by another magnavox soon. I did a search on the internet and found that other buyers have had the same screeching sound with other magnavox dvd players/recorders."
__label__2,"Excellent machine!: I bought this machine a few weeks ago, and it has received fairly heavy use since I received it. Its totally fantastic, and great bang for the purchase price. It consistently produces good seams with regular stitches, over a variety of fabrics. There are only two minor cons to the machine: there is not enough light over the needle area (solution, have a desk lamp) and the bobbin winding is not as automated as the manual says it should be...the automatic winding produces tangled bobbins that are useless. Winding them in the more traditional manner of older machines is much more effective. Overall, its automated features are a great asset to my aging eyes, as I no longer have to thread needles. Purchasing this machine has increased the quality of my sewing tenfold with no real improvement of skill. I wish I had had this machine a decade ago!"
__label__2,Cute!!: Very cute coffee pot. Great for a single person. Light pink. My only complaint is I think it is cheaply made. I probably just paid for the color. But I have a pink kitchen and it is so hard to find pink anything for a kitchen

Will go again next year to see this ""GREAT"" of the motorsports community !"

__label__1,"Terrible Diapers: I have 3 children and have used store brand for all of them. I found these for a great price and thought I'd give them a try. What a waste of money. They leak like crazy and my son wakes up from nap wet and I've had to change him in the night. Not worth the little bit of savings, I'm using more diapers a day than I was so its not saving me anything."
__label__1,"Painfully dull, poorly written rip-off *SPOILERS*: Fearless meets the Sixth Sense. Except that Fearless was excellent and the Sixth Sense was good. This movie is bad. Hathaway and Wilson have absolutely zero chemistry and all they do is blab on and on about nothing. The other characters walk in and out then disappear, only we hardly realize that since they're barely on screen for more than a minute at a time. By the time the end hits - all involved are greatly relieved that it's over. For everyone."
__label__1,"Good Evidence, Bad Analysis: Strobel's book takes us deep into evidence from scholars on the issues of Christ and more exact: Is Christ the Son of God? Perhaps reading a book or trying to find evidence is not the way to start this task... however, revelation is.God is not an object to be pondered, God should be seen as a person to be encountered. Thus, we cannot know God unless God reveals himself to us. As seen in Matthew 16:15 and bit after that... A book to be read regarding this topic should be: ""Natural Theology: Comprising ""Nature and Grace"" by Professor Dr. Emil Brunner and the Reply ""No!"" by Dr. Karl Barth.""Strobel's book can make you feel good about compelling evidence regarding Christology... yet without revelation and without God giving God's self to be known to an alienated humanity, we can never know who God is.Where is the Holy Spirit in Strobel's case?"

This story is the first hand account of the famous WWII fighting submarine, 'The USS Barb' written by its Captain. He was a recipient of the prestigious Medal of Honor for one of missions and is possibly the most decorated naval officer from WWII. None of his men were ever injured in all of his years as a command naval officer."

__label__1,"how can something this deep be so boring??: This book, though short, was incredibly boring. The only thing keeping me from a rating of 1 is the fact that she writes good prose and I kept thinking about the book once I'd finished it. I like creative non-fiction, and I like discursive writing, and I like elusive connections - but come on, Annie. Plus, this book's reflections on mortality depressed me. It doesn't make me want to read her other stuff at all. Oh snooooooooozzzzeeee!"
__label__2,"KEEP YER FEET COOL!: I have wide, hot feet. These shoes, with their perforation, are much cooler than regular tennies, which I have tons of. Now it seems I only wear these Pony's. Surprisingly, although they don't look like it, are very supportive because of the strategic canvas bands. The only reason I give 4 is because the sole tends to be slippery when you least expect it...i.e. on a waxed floor....Otherwise the sole is very grippy."
__label__1,"Started off fine, made me nauseous afterwards: While I like Dinty Moore's beef stew, it seems that this is just one product of theirs that I just don't like.The food isn't that appealing- the food was all pale & pasty looking, but looks can be deceiving when it comes to food, so I went ahead & got it anyway. C'mon... ham & potatoes! How can that be ruined?I unfortunately got my answer- you ruin it by loading it up with tons & tons of grease. The first few bites of this weren't bad & I think that if I only had a small portion of it, it wouldn't be such a terrible thing. (Hence the 2 stars rather than 1 star.) I managed to struggle through the bowl (I hate wasting food & had nothing else to eat), but shortly afterwards I just felt sick to my stomach.If you have either a cast iron stomach or you REALLY like food like this, then you'll probably like it. Me? This is just one DM product I'll never be buying again!!"

This book confirms what I had been convinced of for several years: DON'T TRUST THE GOVERNMENT OR FDA TO LOOK OUT FOR YOUR WELL BEING. They are saying what they thing we peons aren't smart enough to figure out on our own.

__label__1,"Disappointed: this is not worth buying. My kids are pretty creative and I thought this would be a great idea for this years Valentines cards. First of all the cards are just index cards. REALLY. Just regular idex cards. I would have been happy with 4x6 cardstock. The decor was cute, but none were stickers. For the price I expected more than 10 valentines and some stickers. Don't waste your money. You would get a better deal if you bought cardstock and stickers separately."
__label__2,"Wow! This is really cool.: I just received this today, EXACTLY on the 1st. date they gave me for delivery. This Pendant is really very interesting, it is BIG, however. I'll get used to it, people will see me and they WILL know where I stand.I did put it on a heavier gold chain, blends fine with 14k gold.This may sound odd...... But, I opened the box, then the pretty velvet bag, I said a small blessing before putting it on, and, the minute it hit my skin (right across the center of my heart ), I really felt Totally empowered, with the sense I should be wearing this! The energy was Amazing,I got things done with total clarity of what I was needing to do (things I've put off for awhile), of course I know it is slightly ""mass produced"", but it made me feel great!I love it, and have already ordered some more things from ""Silver Insanity"", they are unique, pretty, well constructed, and everything they say they are. I can't wait to see the Ankh I ordered!No worries here!Get EMPOWERED,ENERGIZED and BLESSED."

They're over-played, and most weren't great to begin with. I bought one Now cd (the second one) listened to it twice, and left it in my mom's car 2 years ago. I just think the whole idea is a waste of money."
__label__1,"Silver Palate cook book: I found out about this cookbook from a column in the New York Times and decided to try it. According to the NYT column, the recipes are very good, along with being easy and quick to prepare. I have not as yet tried all the recipes, but the ones I have tried are outstanding. I would call the recipes ""sophisticated"" compared to most cookbooks for everyday eating these days. The recipes I have tried have been easy to prepare, and provide delightful and unusual flavors (at least by my experience). I look forward to making more of these recipes and plan to use this book for everyday eating as well as entertaining."
__label__2,"Best for quality and price!: Have an Epson Artisan 730 printer, bought on the recommendation of a technical person that sells all major brands of printers. I have owned both Kodak and HP printers, and none compare to the 730 for photo printing. Tried using HP and Kodak paper stock on hand, and was not pleased with the quality and/or speed of ""drying"". Bought the Epson paper, and what a difference! Photos come out ""dry"", and quality is substantially better, just as good as those from a commercial developer. Then compare the cost per print, and I will never use anything else. One time that paying more doesn't get you better results."

I'm a big fan of Linksys (and even moreso of Cisco,) my wireless network at home is Linksys and that at my workplace is Cisco.

I am currently awaiting a Return Merchandise Authorization from Linksys so that I can send this piece of rubbish back."

__label__1,"Give me Dr. Phil anyday.: Though this three cassette audio version offers some sound ideas, they certainly are not anything worth your changing your life over, I'm not even sure they WOULD change your life. Neither are they anything self-help lovers have not heard before or read before in some fashion. Also, read by the author Cheryl Richardson, these 3 cassettes tend to have a monotone that could lull the poor listener into a coma. On more than a few occasions, I wondered where the author came up with an idea, since in the next paragraph or later on another cassette, she would clearly relate a story of her own life that contradicted the entire idea she presented in the first place. In fairness, Cheryl Richardson makes it clear she was not intending to ""practice what she preaches"" when she does that, but it just leaves the listener confused. I'm sure this was unintentional, but there's no therapy here folks."

__label__2,"Falling Down into Hell: I liked reading this short story. Fifteen year-old, Kenneth tells how he died three times and what it felt like when he died. He also describes returning to his body during those three times, apparently from a deformed heart condition. Then he goes on to tell of the fourth time he died and was sucked down into Hell. A scary monster grabbed him by his arm to pull him, like a spider, into his chambers of horror, darkness, and separation from God. He screamed, praying to God as loud as he could. And then a force stronger than the evil monster pulled him up out of the clutches of eternal Hell. Kenneth was rescued because he had prayed a quick version of the sinner's prayer, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Kenneth Hagin went on to live for his Lord, preaching, dying at the ripe old age of eighty-five.An excellent story!!Now I recommend reading:Heaven A Joyful Place"
__label__2,Neil Simon book: Arrived very quickly. Price made it a great deal. Book looked brand new. I see no need to pay more for something when you can get a great deal.
__label__2,"Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?"

Though the texts acommpanying visual metarial is limited with very basic knowledge; drawings project, photographs and 3d presentations -hardly distinguishes from real Photos- are satisfying.Briefly it can be claimed here that this book is a good source which puts forwards the way a star architect represents his ideas with supportive visual material, however the textual structure which could have provide an access to the design processes is very poor.Orun ERSANArchitect -Turkiye-"
__label__2,"LOVED IT!: We watched all 8 episodes in 4 nights and would have done it faster if sleep weren't required! It is SO exciting! Of course, we had both read the book and much of it is left out, but this was a fun way to see the story unfold."
__label__1,"Christian Fiction?: When I first started reading this book I got caught up in the characters and then the storyline became so obvious about how the pastors children would turn out. I get so disappointed when I read a novel that is suppose to be Christian fiction and uses profanity throughout the book. I was looking for an uplifting novel, but instead it leaves you depressed. Let's just say if you like drama, this is the book for you, but if you are a Christian don't bother to read this book."

__label__2,"Pretty good book: Lately there have been a lot of this kind of story in the movies: Going to a planet, something goes wrong, all hell breaks loose, etc. A lot of scifi suspense movies, if you will. Mission to Mars, Pitch Black, etc. There have been a lot in general, actually. This is the first book that I've read along those lines, and this is pretty good. There's a lot more depth in any book, of course, but this really shows the genre in a new light. I can't say it was the best scifi I've read, Dune holds that honor (and with good cause), but this one ranks in the top twenty or so. Well worth a read!"

And for the reviewer who felt a size 18 was obese....it's amazing how Mae West managed to look so good with her obese body. And I just know Marilyn Monroe at size 16 must have disgusted us all.

__label__1,"Richard Ford, you crook! Return my money!: Why doesn't ecom have a zero star rating? This book certainly merits (demerits?) a big fat zip. Although technically accomplished, Mr. Ford has absolutely nothing at all to say. To use baseball (hey, why not! Bascombe likes it!) as a metaphor, this book's plot development (and resulting reader interest) is as flat as a as baseball diamond, with a little mound of action in the middle. I was astounded that this book won a Pulitzer. Who voted that year? Chimpanzees throwing darts?A complete waste of time and money. Hey Richard, send me a refund!"

__label__2,Life-changing.. It's a MUST READ!: No review I write can ever do justice to the power of this book. I'm a Pakistan-born female now settled in America and the book struck multiple chords with me. It's a roller-coaster ride of emotions making me tear up and then laugh out loud. The story is well-written and mind-blowingly amazing. Greg Mortenson is no less than a super hero and reading his true story will change you forever. This book is as human as it gets and I cannot recommend it enough!

__label__2,"Great for charmed fans!: This book was pritty good, i didnt like it as much as i did 'The power of three' which is what initialy got me hooked on Charmed, after reading that i expected something very good, and this fell a little below my expectations.

__label__1,"Disturbing, Yet Boring: The first part of the book kept my interest with odd action, but as Wright preaches to the reader through Bigger's lawyer near the end, the book takes a turn for the worst. This book was overall terrible."
__label__2,"use with discretion: Schoenberg is willing to reconsider and rethink every aspect of traditional music theory. It's too bad his conclusions are almost invariably wrong, but this book will help you reconsider and rethink traditional music theory yourself--and come to your own conclusions. Also: this is much too unwieldy for the classroom; use Robert Ottman's texts instead. I recommend as well PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns--for theory and for practice."
__label__2,"I can't believe all of the things that happened in this book!: This was the most shocking, intense book I have ever read. It was definitely a page turner. At times though you had such an image in your head that you didn't want to know what else could possibly happen. I would only recommend this book to open minded people, that don't mind vulgarity. I thought this book was definitely worth reading, but I know many people that wouldn't be able to handle it. I definitely think it's a book for 18 and older."
__label__1,"Tricked: Trying to complete my ""Wayne"" collection, I saw some titles I hadn't seen before. They turned out to be colorized versions of""Dawn Rider"", ""Paradise Valley"" and ""Winds of the Wastelands"". The color is washed and not very good. To be fair, the original B&W versions are also included. Run away!"
__label__2,intriguing: I love the movie which might have an effect on my love for the soundtrack. Track 1 is by far my favorite. It whips the listener away to another time and place. It charges confidence as well. I listen to it before giving speeches and always feel stronger. It's amazing what this cd can do besides please the ears.
__label__2,"A classic in cosmology: Originally published in 1934, this Dover reprint covers the early development of cosmology in a rigorous mathematical format. You need to know math through tensor equations (as you would for any rigorous treatment of cosmology), and this probably should not be anyone's first foray into cosmology. For that, see Peebles. Having said that, this gives sidelights present nowhere else, and a fine treatment of some by-passed cosmological models."

__label__2,"Good-looking and honest: We've been using this scale for many months without complaint. Not being hardcore fitness buffs, we weren't interested in something that calculates body fat, hydration, life expectancy, or whatever the fancy scales do for you these days. My requirements were digital and attractive, and that's it.Attractive, without being too much like modern art, I should say. The blue-green tinted glass matches our custom shower door perfectly.As S. Duncan mentions, turning the scale on is fairly simple if you just lift it up a tad and let it drop. When you see ""00,"" get on. I don't find it as challenging as some others.Seems very accurate, although I have nothing to compare it to. This is our only scale and I don't go to doctors often enough to know what their scales say."
__label__2,Makes life easy: So much easier to keep your humidifier clean.. It really seems to limit mold buildup. I would have rated it 5 stars if it lasted longer than 30 days.
__label__2,Good...: I just bought this item two days and boy it is worth my money! It doesn't playback on my discman but it said that constantly that it's not going to work with all cd audio players. It almost blew my ears when I played the DVD side for the disc. I am always interested in acquiring new music. I visited the website and it gave no specific lists of CD & DVD players that would work with the CD audio side. I think that I will wait to buy another DualDisc until they give a list of players that can read the DualDisc CD side.

The sun shade sounds like paper when opened and closed. The seat is made of the same fabric but not as noisy as the seat cushion muffles the sound a little. For a middle of the line stroller, this is not acceptable in my mind and I knew it would bother me everytime I used the stroller...Very sad because it looks great and I researched every stroller out there...Going to try the Joovey next..."
__label__1,"Don't buy if you have kids: I have a 10 month old and wanted an inexpensive camera that would hold me over until I could get an D-SLR camera. The lag when indoors between when the button is pressed and the time the picture is way way way too long. This is reduced outdoors, making it bearable. Unfortunately, my 10 month old isn't walking yet so we still spend quite a bit of time indoors. Also, time between pictures indoors is around 6 seconds, this is unacceptable."

__label__2,Beautifully ugly: The perfect shoe for walking around the house. Spongy and soft. The first steps are painful for me in the morning and these things take the pain away. The only negative is that the tread on the bottoms wear out a little too fast and when slick are dangerous on a wet walkway or driveway.
__label__1,"Caution!: I was quite disappointed by this book, full with bad examples, the girl steals, lies several times, is cruel with her mother and mistreats her brothers with no consequences to all this behavior. Then you have the birds that in the book are told to be the souls from deaths, are we talking about reincarnation? or they are simply demons? for sure there is nothing Christian about this. And is also quite sad, so this book needs a lot of guidance from parents."
__label__2,"LOVE this pan: Wow...if you want to make some great corn bread, buy this pay. After making my Jiffy Bread corn mix with a few secret ingredents, I put it into this wedge pan and bake.

__label__1,"Strong chemical smell: I have been wearing Jockey for years, but the quality has been going steadily downhill. The cotton is nowhere near as soft or durable as it used to be and the sizing is often hit and miss. Still I kept buying them because it's hard to find 100% cotton underwear.But now, this horrible smell is a deal breaker. I will have to find another brand. Besides the odor, it is just not healthy to wear a chemically saturated item of clothing. Your skin absorbs toxins from everything it comes in contact with and at the very least it could cause an allergic skin reaction. Steer clear of these until Jockey addresses this problem."
__label__2,"Gaga for Coco: A blues neophyte, I&#65533;d never even heard of Coco when, for some strange reason, I took a [price] flyer on this CD. Was actually looking for a more traditional sound, but after about four listens, became Coco&#65533;s newest fan. Have always been somewhat contemptuous of those who boogie-while-driving, but defy you to listen to cuts like &#65533;Running Away From Love&#65533; and &#65533;I Wont Beg&#65533; without doing your own imitation of a bobble-head doll. Coco has a rock-solid voice that&#65533;s reminiscent of the original and best lead singer from Chicago (the group not the city) whose name escapes me. His guitar work is nimble, versatile and precise and can be melodic or pulsating without beating you into submission. In fact, it&#65533;s difficult to decide what Coco does better, sing or play guitar. But what does it matter when music such as this is the result his combined effort? Buy this. You&#65533;ll like it."
__label__1,"It's better than nothing, but I don't love the formula change: This used to be a miracle worker. I don't really use much hair product because my laziness far outweighs my desire to look presentable. The old formula was light but still super effective and took a whopping 2 seconds to force my hair into submission. The new(ish) formula is so light that I'm convinced, much like the emperor's new clothes, it only works if you believe in it. It's inspiring me to sell empty bottles to people and tell them it's a new super lightweight formula called ""Nuthing"" (you have to spell it that way otherwise no one will believe you). I won't be reordering this styling cream...I mean CREME."

__label__2,"Their finest album since Romany: Song by song this is the Hollies most creative and satisfying album since Romany. At the very least it doesn't have those silly embarassments like Wiggle that Wotsit that usually mar their albums. When I'm Yours and Say it Ain't So should have been big hits, the Hollies at their finest. It also marked Ron Richards last work with the Hollies, perhaps hastened by difficulties with Allan Clarke. Ron Richards has said that this was an excellent album and I have to agree."

__label__2,"Fun, Fun, Fun!!!: This is probably the most fun, and best game, let alone baketball game I have ever played! Awesome graphics, and surprisingly good and different moves. I reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for something new. Tough challenges arise as you move up the difficulty, and beat more and more teams. I just bought this game four days ago, and it rocks. There is a great aspect of the game in which you can add characters to your ""arsenal"" and make your team truly unbeatable. Great game..."
__label__1,"Despite interesting vocal talent, fails in disgrace: I hate having to say this, but Babs, in spite of an interesting voice, didn't catch my attention too much. I had the single ""I Dreamed of You"" before I realized news of the album's release.Mother told me about her singing a duet with Andrea Bocelli, but that's totally fictitious. She hasn't gone with Bocelli (she never will, either). See, it's a strategy that's gone on long enough: whenever new albums by Babs come out, it will seem like a miracle to her entire legion of fans, but not interesting to the likes of me.Bottom line: it's time to surrender once and for all."
__label__2,"Worth every penny: Even though It comes in a little pricey for me, this slice of classic TV is priceless. Some of the special features feel like an after thought maybe, but the episodes alone are worth the price of admission"
__label__1,"Not great: This product was good, but not great. We ended up buying a different press for about the same price, and we like it significantly better. This one was just too hard to get the patties out, and didn't provide a good indication of how big or well formed the patties are. I'd suggest adding measurements (half pound, 1/3 pound, etc) to the outside, or provide a clear case so you can see that it has been properly formed without gaps.Also, the silicone liner thing was hard to remove and put back in. Overall, I would not recommend this one over alternative products available on ecom."

Nicely filmed, and what eye candy!"

I have to say, that using the starter made the yogurt making process so much better, because the ingredients they use in the culture is so healthy and it makes the yogurt so much more delicious. I already fell in love with the Euro Cuisine Yogurt maker, now I have fallen in love with their starter as well."
__label__2,"good starting point in English: It's unfortunate that there's no complete modern translation of the Rig Veda into English. Doniger's selection is a lovely starting point for readers coming to this text for the first time. She is an excellent scholar with a detailed knowledge of the Sanskrit language and the ancient culture that it documents. Moreover, her affection for ancient India comes through clearly, here as in all of her works.All the obvious hymns are here, with useful notes. Although this is only a selection from the Rig Veda, it's enough to give students a sense of the work and of the ancient rituals and stories that go with it. (And, perhaps, to pique their interest in studying Sanskrit for themselves!)"
__label__1,"This book is just not accurate: I have to agree with Stephen Haines. This guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink. He makes Boehme a Gnostic, the troubadors, the Knights Templar, William Blake, the Masons, Jung, and finally, any physicist worth his salt.I mean, some of these folks might not have been orthodox in their Christian practice, but being heterodox does not make one a Gnostic.How did he forget Meister Eckhart, and Sabbatai Tzvi? If he has Boehme as a Gnostic, then these also are Gnostic.He never distinguishes between Gnosticism as a group of sects, and gnostic practice, which pervades Kabbalah, Sufism,etc.This is just not a good book."
__label__2,"Oral History is good: This book emphasizes the importance of oral history. Although you might not find polished masterpieces here, ""East to America"" accomplishes the much-needed task of placing Korean-American voices within a more prominent context--or at least publishes their voices. Praise for Elaine Kim & Co. for compiling the book; in my own research there has been slim pickins as far as the K.A. literature goes). But, as a ""second generation"" (American-born) Korean-American, I was disappointed to find that few members of my own generation (X?) were included in the collection (But it makes sense; after all, the book is called ""East to America"" ...bah). I found the stories gritty and real, and it was hard to put the book down. I would recommend this book to not only any Korean-American, but to anyone who is interested in viewing the Korean-American population as something more than gun-toting greengrocers or model minority geeks."
__label__2,"Decent: Not bad, perfect for what it was designed for... Best thing is you don't have to worry about the smaller corn falling out because the sides have a bar that holds even the loose ones in. Not the best quality, but works great never-the-less."
__label__2,"Perfect for circuit board work: I got these to cut & trim electronic part leads on a couple of IC circuit board projects. They work really well and cut hundreds of leads effortlessly.The cutting edges are well machined and give you the control you need for working in tight spaces. I have large hands and the molded grips are comfortable. They're spring loaded which makes them easy to use, and I use a rubber band to keep them closed before putting them away (to protect the cutting edges, etc.) When working, I just leave them in easy reach. Solder, clip, repeat...Sure, you can spend more on other pliers or for heavy duty work, like guitar strings or 12 gauge electrical wires, but these are perfect for electronic work."

It is a place where authors share their promotion ideas in an effort to help one another. Francine assembled the best of these and that makes it a book of practical--and heartfelt--ideas.

__label__2,"Former teen princess goes all out techno w/80's tune: Debbie really shows here that she can dance it up with the club scene of the late 1990's. The remixes here are fine dance efforts. But contrary to others, this collection of the same song remixed practically the same every time is not fierce in terms of club techno. Madonna will always be the queen techno diva and while Deb did wisely use the obvious talent of Madonna pal and long time collaborator-Junior Vasquez, her ending results are fine. Not legendary techno club music by any stretch of the the words. I like these mixes and i was thrilled to find them. But they also fit into the category of typical top 40 hits putting on the techno mask.The fit is fine,not spectacular. Her mixes of ""Losin' Myself"" which were released only to club D.J.'s and which i have copies of are worlds better."
__label__1,Unreliable: I would not recommend this product to anyone especially someone who is closely monitoring their blood pressure. The readings were very inconsistant. When I took it to my doctors office to compare readings the Omron was not even close. The doctor's reading was 128/74 the Omron was 158/105. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. It should be labled as a health hazard.
__label__2,"Very lightweight, does what it's designed to do.: This product works very well for what its intended for. Its extremely lightweight and seems to be durable. There is some plastic parts on this product but I can't see anyone breaking it unless your extremely rough on it. (Maybe running it over with a vehicle will do it.)My only complaint is the support plate is a little shallow. I'm thinking about welding a aluminium extension to it because I use my hand truck for carrying my tools in plants that I work in. My bag barely fits on the stock plate, but for most people's uses I don't think it will be a problem.As for storage, for me it couldn't be better. Its aluminium so it won't rust, and I keep mine behind my toolbox in the back of my truck. It works great for my needs and I think as far as storage it will be great for most users.All in all I recommend this product to everyone who needs a lightweight, collapsible hand truck."
__label__1,"So hard to follow: I have taken more than a few programming classes and read my fair share of technical textbooks. This is in the top two worst list for me. It's very verbose. It doesn't have screenshots. The charts are ugly to look at and not easy to follow. Someone clearly missed the point of a page break.To add insult to injury the author still has not published a digital copy. Now I'm lugging around a huge, poorly written text and I can't use a search function to parr down the verbose nonsense to get to the information I really need.I wish instructors would quit using this book for Unix classes!"
__label__1,I'd not recommend to buy this book.: Alligator jerky? Huh? Goat jerky? Who will make alligator or goat jerky? I found very few good jerky recipes that you can find online for free. I'd not recommend to buy this book.
__label__2,"Great system, in service since May of 2002!: I researched what was available at the time and settled on the Siemens 8825 and added 3 handsets for a total of 4.1) Setup was quite simple after reading the manual, though I would of layed it out differently, but that's just my opinion.2) I have never had any problems with the base or handsets since I purchased them.3) The separate voice mailboxes worked great for me. I use it for my business and home phone. It intergrates well with the phone companies features. (mail, etc.)4) I have not experienced any problems with my wireless network that operates on the same 2.4 GHz.The only complaint I have is occasionally I will hear a clicking sound in the handset when talking on the phone. This is usually caused by outside interference such as a microwave.Overall it has done a good job and been very reliable. I would definitely reccommend the Gigaset 8825."
__label__2,"Unbelievablly true!: I ordered this because it was an ecom lightening deal and because my son is about to move. There were good reviews so thought I'd take a chance.Today I helped a friend move. It was unbelievably easy lifting the heavy appliances with this devise. We didn't have a regular dolly for the refrig, stove, washer and dryer and didn't need one because we had this shoulder dolly. Do not hesitate to get one of these. It almost makes moving items fun (okay, don't believe that). But do believe this: You'll lift with your legs, save your back, and find your efforts are doubled. I help friends a lot with their moves, so I think this may help my reputation. I'm 56, diabetic, and this devise works so well, that I thought it fair to give it a glowing review."
__label__2,"A wild exotic ride: This book is a fantastic read from start to finish. The ONLY issue I have is that the character Omaha could have been a little less Indiana Jones. Having his name be a State, and the author actually call him ""Indiana"" by one of the other characters is really not necessary. Other than that, I loved the whole book, and I loved the end. It will hook you in to the Sigma series."
__label__1,Movie was a let down: The directing was too wierd to keep up with. The plot was not at all great. I think Van Damme should go back to movies where he really uses his talents.
__label__1,"The Blind LEADING THE BLIND: NOT ONE VERSE will you find in the New Testament telling Christians or churches to tithe. Jesus said tithing was ""of the matters of the law"" and was NEVER part of the NT covenant. There is no command nor example of any Christian tithing in scripture. PAstors have NO authority to teach tithing. Malachi spoke to those under the OT Laws and ordinances (3:8), but Christ abolished in his flesh those very ordinances! Eph 2:15 15 by abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace"". Read ""The Tithe That Binds"" also and you will NEVER tithe again because you will see the truth."
__label__1,"Great Except for the Rust: I love cast iron teapots. They keep the tea warm for hours and the tea never gets bitter. This was a beautiful teapot and it's great that it comes with cups, but the tea basket inside rusted after only two brews. I exchange the tea basket, but again it rusted. I'm trying a third exchange and this time with a completely new teapot, but if anyone wants to avoid this unfortunate hassle I'd recommend different brand of teapots."

__label__1,"Is the cure in the cupboard?: After searching for this book for over a month I finally received my copy and set out to study all about the Oregano in my cupboard. Much to my surprise before even finishing the introduction Dr. Igram disclaimed the whole title with a statement the Oregano that we can purchase at the grogery or health food store was not acceptable. ""In other words , whatever the supermarket has on its shelves or whatever the health food purveyor might provide, it isn't medical grade oregano: period. Such products will not and cannot exhibit the curative effects described in this book."" Mr Igram then goes on to promote a obscure company as the sole source for the oregano that works. If you decide to call the 800 number listed be prepared to shell out around a hundred dollars. Overall the book could have been a lot of fun and quite a help for home remidies. The only problem is I don't know and he didn't tell me what this stuff in my cupboard should be."
__label__1,"Not a quality bag: I'm going to have to return it. It is made of cheap vinyl and looks like it. The clasp and handle attachments are cheap-looking, too.It is also tiny.All in all, it would only be good to give to a child for dress-up, but you could get a bag for that at Goodwill and help handicapped people and save money at the same time. Heck, for the price they are charging for one of these, you could get 20 bags at Goodwill or Salvation Army if they are 50 cents each."
__label__1,False advertisement??: I just bought a Monarch 8-32x50mm scope from ecom and this Nikon 50mm sunshade at the same time. It was even too wide for the Monarch.

__label__1,"Don't Bother!!!: I spent A LOT of time researching blenders before choosing this one. I ignored the complaints about the pitcher leaking, believing other reviews about the problem being fixed. WRONG! After one month of daily use the pitcher began to leak where the screw, holding the blade on was. I liked the blender's performance, so exchanged the ""defective"" one. Three months later I had the same exact problem. Do not waste your time or money on this blender!"

I was overseas and left stranded with no ability to charge my cell phone or camera. I had to go out and hunt down another converterin a strange country. Worse yet, when I returned from my trip, the manufacturer refused to refund my money, saying it was longer than 30 days since my purchase."
__label__2,"Engaging movie: I had seen this movie a number of years ago, and was glad to have found it on DVD. One of the problems was that during the first half of the movie, the dialogue is not in sync with the actors. Then, suddenly the voices become aligned. It may have been a fluke during the transfer from video to this format. Nonetheless the music and costumes are top notch."
__label__1,"Double Helix Review: The reason for my low rating of this book is its mundane plot. Although the book did give insight on the making of the double helix, it failed to keep an interesting story. Although some of the characters had interesting personalities I feel that that were barely excersized because of the books dull storyline. I reccommend this book to those who wish to learn about the making of the double helix, not to those looking for a page turning novel. James Watson may be an innovative scientist, but he isn't much of a writer."
__label__2,"The Lost Years: Thank God for this book. If you are a mother struggling with a teen-age daughter's addictions, this is the book for you. The book was written from the heart by a brillant young woman who pulled herself out of the ""living hell"" of drug and alcohol addiction and a brave mother who realized that the only way her child would recover was if she allowed her to do it on her own. It is a blessing and a miracle they both survived the ordeal to write the book. I am sure you will be inspired by Kristina's and Constance's compelling story. It offers great insight and hope for all of us.Mary H-BTexasApril 2008"
__label__2,"To kill, or not to kill, that's the question: This is the Batman movie I like the most. So real, like the Spiderman ones which for a moment or two you feel worry for his personal problems and fear for his safey that the hero ""may"" die. So noble, that Batman and his comrades resolved to law and justice despite the loss of love and power. However, I cant help but ask the following question, ""Can there be someone on Earth with this absolute self control and faith not to make things right with their own hands whilst facing such big evil (and risk)!"" No matter what, this movie is both philosophical and entertaining. Recommended!"
__label__2,"great deal: I gave some of these as part of a gift. They seemed to work great as I loaded them up with programs and files. They weren't the fastest but they weren't bad either. One of my little brothers, however, has already lost his. Maybe a lanyard or key chain would be helpful."

__label__1,"Don't waste your money.: This product looks nice, heavy duty, hard to tip over. They will last about 6 months until every single one of them start cracking for no reason what-so-ever. I put them in the dishwasher fine and NOT over crowded, top rack and every time I go to put the dishes away at least one is broken. I am now down to 9 after 6 months and I haven't even dropped them or anything!"
__label__2,Love it: For a 20 min workout this one is a killer! I love to switch up my workouts with shorter and longer and even though this is a shorter one you get that great worked out feeling in such a short period of time. Imo Jillian has that perfect balance of motivating and encouraging without taking any crap. Also great as it works out numerous muscle groups:) Definitely worth the 2 bucks.
__label__1,"This was the second one we bought. Hummed.: That says it all. The first one we bought from ecom was another brand and it did not work at all. No, wait. This one didn't work at all. The second one hummed and we have yet to return it."
__label__2,"Great Ice Cream Maker!: I had never tried to make ice cream before this machine, and it works great! Obviously, you need rock salt to make it work, but that can be cheaply purchased here at ecom or at most grocery stores. I was torn between several ice cream makers and am glad I went with this one since it's easy to use, makes great ice cream super quickly, and was an unbeatable price for its quality. I can usually whip up a batch of fresh ice cream in 30-50 minutes using ingredients I have on hand in my fridge. The motor does make a noise but it doesn't bother me; you actually need to hear a little noise so that you'll know when it stops churning. If it was silent, I'd have to stay in the room with it to see when it was done! Overall, very pleased with this machine."

__label__1,"Kept flooding my countertop: Not sure if it's the cone filter design, but the bottom of the filter would get coffee grinds stuck in it and it coffee would fill up, go over the top and flood my kitchen counter, once every month or two. Eventually replaced it out of frustration about a year after purchasing it. Tried a KitchenAid but that died just after the warranty ran out. Now I'm trying Capresso. Hopefully that will perform better!"
__label__1,"Not a good movie: I did not like this movie at all! It was kinda scary at times....but I believe the people making this movie did not want to make it a horror film....Was'nt all the crimes this man commited ""Horrific""? Bad acting from the supporting cast."
__label__2,"Great Picture: I bought this for traveling with my two year old. I have owned it for a month and my daughter watches it almost every day. In the house, with hands on the screen (I left the film attached), knocking it off the arm of the couch and ottom and the thing still works great. The picture and sound quality are great. However, you will need to purchase a larger carrying case, for all of your goodies, becuase the one provided is only big enough for the dvd player. The case is used to attach to you car seat so it needs to have a snug fit and that it does. I highly recommed this product for adults or children. Another plus, this item actually comes with a manual, unlike some of the other RCA products. Good luck shopping."
__label__1,"Some situations may be too upsetting for some kids: Since none of the other reviewers mentioned this, I thought I'd let people know that there are a number of disturbing events (like beheadings) that may upset some children. The book uses the word ""prostitution"" once, which might raise questions if your child hasn't encountered this word yet. I'm not saying don't read it....Gladys was an amazing woman and the story is fascinating from start to end. I just wanted potential readers to be aware so that they are not surprised (as I was). ecom lists it for children ages 4-8, but it seems like it is more appropriate for grades 4-8."
__label__1,"Don't waste your money...: I normally don't do reviews, but this is one product I feel the need to write about. I have always bought cheap earpieces because they seem to last at least 6 months before I have to replace them which is fine. This particular one worked for 3 days before it broke. I couldn't hear anyone and they couldn't hear me, it wound up in the trash. Even though its inexpensive, don't waste your money.."

__label__1,"Not accurate - Cpmplete Disappointment: This laptop is a big disappointment for me. As a parent of a 4 year old I find this a poor choice at any age. The keyboard has the letters ordered across in alphabetical order, not as real keyboards are. This I strongly feel is going to confuse children of 3 years or up for their future use of computers. This perhaps is okay for children 18 months to no older than 36 months. Mouse also is not accurate but works. The graphics are very poor as others stated and difficult to see since not lit at all. Even the audio is poor. It is garbled enough that we cannot determine if the man said c,e,b or d because you it all sounds the same just something eeee. Cannot tell if it is bah eee, da eee, sss eee etc.Not something I would recommend for child of any age."
__label__1,"Overhelming .. But carefull: I read the book within 48h, it iswell written indeed, the autor is a talented journalist.. BUT she's not historian furthermore her close link to the tragedy (it was a tragedy) arouse questions. After some research, I discover that several aspect of the books, and not only details were if not false, but incorrect, inexact, and biaised. Imperial Japan (like Nazi Germany)did bad, really bad things. Those crimes must undestand and prevented to happen again. But Japan (a democracy) like the German Republic are different now and can't be judged on those past actions. The book unfortunalty doesn't give me this impression. World is not black and white, Japan is a democracy, but I agree that some effort must be made for the apology; China is a dictature responsible for the death of millions of their own people. Fact should be the only source of that kind of books, not hanger."

Pierné's quintet from 1919, a more understated but more confident work, comes off just as well here. Both receive quality performance and recording."

Infact after I stopped consuming Glucosamine, few months later my knee was back in shape. I do not take any supplements for my knee at all and instead I have added more fruits, vegetables and nuts to my diet which have been very helpful to my health. At least that is what my blood test show year after year as well as my knees and joints tell me after every workout from mountain biking to surfing to weight lifting."
__label__1,"No excuse: I am really disappointed with this product.To begin with, the interface looks like something from the 80's. Second, the video screen is too small. With today's technology, this is just not acceptable. There aren't that many lessons and they offer day to day situations someone would need. I simply don't want to use this product.I would recommend Microsoft's Encarta series. This software allows you to schedule the entire course depending on how fast you want to learn. Second, it has large video screens with people speaking in real time. Third, you get a booklet to help study and fourth, they give you an audio CD to take with you to practice the lessons. As much as I dislike giving money to Microsoft, this product is all you would need.Learn French Now just doesn't offer what it should."

You've probably already seen this movie if you are considering buying this bluray, but it has NEVER looked nearly this good. I've seen this on VHS and DVD, and thank god we finally get the proper aspect ratio as it was projected originally. There are some imperfection, dust and the like on the print, but honestly a good job was done cleaning this up considering this came out in 1984. The sound is a bit shakier, but that is simply a fact of having a film this old with no surround mix to be had. If you liked this movie before, you are going to love it on bluray. They didn't just throw this thing out, they put some work into doing it right."

SO of course I was lured to this book. But people, these are DEMONs from another realm, they are NOT zombies. If you want the traditional living dead, stay away from this book. If you are looking for something new, you might kind of like this book. I say ""might"" because, besides the misleading zombie description, the book bit a little. You end up not really caring about any of the characters, they were underdeveloped, and really this book was a yawn fest (sorry Keene if you ever read this... I know you tried). And the parts that were meant to be funny, were not. If you are still interested, buy this book used, not new."

We have not experienced any problems with it and do not anticipate any although we haven't yet had to deal with changing the oil. I read the reviews for many different fryers before deciding on this one and am very pleased with it and the price.
__label__2,"Charming, if dated: This is a truly charming book that will make you laugh, cry, and all that jazz. It is a bit better than the movie version, and light years above the stage version. The stories of a family living with an efficiancy expert is funny enough, the fact that there are 12 kids (well, actually 11 b/c one dies of diptheria when she is really young) makes it all the funnier. Unfortunatly, this book is rather dated as is apparent by he considerable racism. (The Parents perform a minstrel show for their children, anything taboo is deemed ""eskimo,"" the sterotypical portrayel of a chinease cook, etc.) Fortuately, this parts are easiyl skipped over, though they really should be cut. Read this book, it is genuinly touching and has some nice lessons about family, but I would recommend editing it before you share it with impressionable young children."
__label__2,"Fundamentals of Marching: I first encountered this book while looking for information on marching bands (my number one passion). It was very informative and showed me a lot on how to improve my marching skills. It gave definitions, drum major commands, how to march, how to create formations, and more."
__label__2,"I finally own a skate tool!: I'm glad I purchased this item. The construction is sturdy and compact.

Once you recognize that you will be better able to deal with this type of individual. Beware- because they really are wolves and can do much damage.

__label__2,"A Wonderful Read: This novel is a wondeful read and it is by far one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The book is so well written and detailed that you can almost see and hear the sites and sounds of Shanghai as you read. Bo Caldwell does a fantastic job of portraying life in Shanghai prior to the invasion of the Japanese and also in presenting historical facts about the changes and hardships which this invasion brought upon the people living there. She does this in such a way, that you are able to learn a great deal about Shanghai and it's past and at the same time enjoy a well written and intricate story. Not only does this book deal with Japan's invasion of Shanghai, but it is also examines the relationship between a father and the daughter whom he abandons. I would highly recommend this book to anybody interested in Shanghai or anybody who simply wants to read a very interesting and well-written book."
__label__2,"Fantastic Camera - Everything I expected it to be: I have been looking forward to getting a digital SLR for a long time. This camera was everything I expected it to be, and more. It starts up quickly and can easily take 2-3 pictures a second. I have small children who don't tend to sit still too long, so that was a big plus for me. The quality is awesome. The other aspect that I'm extremely impressed with is the battery life. There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said. I highly recommend this camera."
__label__1,My iCN 510 only work for 13 months.: I spent $544 bought a Navman iCN 510 last year in June. It only works for about 13 months. The memory card stops working. I called the tech support; they told me that it passed one-year warranty. I have to spend $150+ to ship it back and get it repaired. I can't believe this thing can really find a good time to die! At least this company is good at making it's GPS last till the warranty passes.
__label__1,"Great Movies on Terrible DVDs--Don't Buy!: Unlike the other Hitchcock collections I own (Masterpiece and Signature), the packaging on this set is terrible: the plastic/acrylic case cracked almost immediately without any real pressure (i.e., opening it should not cause the case to crack along an entire edge), and although the binder of DVD slip covers is nice-looking, it's not particularly practical in terms of preventing the discs from being scratched (and I'm really careful with this sort of thing). But the worst part of this product is that the DVDs do not play. We tried watching _Rebecca_, one of my favorites, only to find that the entire movie just skips and jumps and hesitates and then doesn't play at all. It's terribly frustrating! And it turns out it's not a one-disc problem; it's several discs. So don't bother with this collection; it's a waste of money, and it ruins the Hitchcock experience!"
__label__2,"Short and to the point about surviving in business: Written by theformer president and CEO of Intel Corporation, located here in Santa Clara, California. I could not put this book down. The 10X power concept and Strategic Inflection Points apply to all of us in business. Well-written, fascinating, easy to understand; a reflection of the company. Also very thought provoking. If you are an executive or entrepreneur or in a decision making position, I strongly recommend you read this book. You will not forget what you read here."
__label__1,"Egg Cooker: This egg cooker has too many variables.....to get close to a perfect egg you have to take into consideration the size of the egg, how much water you put in the cooker, whether the water is warm or cold. Too much work for just eggs. Easier to put it in a pan on the stove."
__label__1,"Not for me: I didn't like it. It was my fault though, I didn't take 'student edition' too seriously. I ended up getting the 'real' microsoft word."
__label__1,"BORING!: Well crafted direction with good performances by the children, this movie is not very scary, and is a trojan horse for themes that attack religion and pro-war politics. All fine and well, but the story cannot support such large themes since it is trite, manipulative, and is so concerned with setting us up with its trick ending. Children may be frightened at some of the faux horror, but if you let them watch it till the end, they'll fall asleep and wake up as liberals. You been warned!Want to save money and find out the ending? Here it is: everybody is dead, including the screenwriter!"
__label__1,Garbage!: My puppy Paw Paw hates this stuff.And I hate it to. It get's my whole house plus the inside of the toy stink. And my next door neighboor dog Fluffy the Bichon frise ate this stuff one time and ended up in the emergenciey room! But she is better but needs to rest for a couple days.
__label__1,junk: I had my 455 serviced in January(2009). Unit was fixed and returned. Worked for another 5 months then it started acting up. Informed Sony with much complaining they decided to fix for free. I received a call several days later that unit was unfixable and they would be returning my purchased price. I will give them credit for customer service. Don't buy this unit.
__label__2,"Code Practice Kit: I purchased the kit to be used by Boy Scouts for the Signaling Merit Badge. It works very well. Not too loud to be anoying to parents. Kit assembled easily, it took me about 20 minutes to assemble, but I do have experience. With help, first time kit builders should do well."
__label__1,"Nothing New: I've been a comedy fan for many years, I have over 400 comedy albums, including all of Jeff Foxworthy's albums, sadly, this album is no better then his ""Greatest Bits"", and long time fans will noot find any new material from Jeff exept the dvd clips which I find too short and just musical, not comedy."
__label__2,"You would have to pay me to put it down. A lot.: Absolutely spellbinding; moving faster than the first (The Ill-Made Mute). The first book sets the scene beautifully, but now the characters are flesh and blood (or otherwise...) persons for whose fate you worry; it is refreshing and rare for a book to develop the characters to a level where you are focusing on the impact events will have on *them*, rather than wondering solely where the plot twists will lead you.I found myself furiously plowing through the entire thing in less than 2 days... and now I'm as anxious and bereft as one with the Langothe for the next book!!! HURRY UP Cecilia!!! :-)"

__label__1,"Title is deceiving....: If you are looking for an inspirational true-life story of beating-all-the-odds, this is your book. If you are looking for an account of how one man's (and really, one community's) faith can move mountains, again, this is your book. Don Piper's journey is certainly inspirational.However, do not look for this book to be dedicated to what Mr. Piper's heaven looked like. I am not saying this isn't a good read, it's just that Mr. Piper's 90 minutes in heaven (which he describes in only one chapter,) is really a spring board from which he enters part 2 of his life. And this book is about his struggle to return to life and ultimately, how his journey now inspires others."
__label__1,"Cool!: Dude this kicks! Really fast and loud, dissonant. I've never heard piano sound like this. And its really cheap too. WOW!BUT THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE MUSIC. THESE WERE ALL GREAT COMPOSERS, AND THIS PIANIST TREATS THEM LIKE PEOPLE WHO JUST WROTE LOTS OF NOTES THAT WERE HARD TO PLAY. BUY POLLINI OR ASHKENAZY INSTEAD. THIS IS COOL BUT NOT WORTH TEH $7!"
__label__2,"Fits okay, sounds good, costs little: You could buy a more elaborate, prettier headset, and I'm fairly certain you could buy one that fits more snugly. But for under $50, there's no better alternative than the HS805, which has easy controls and pairing, and quality sound."
__label__2,"A Great Book ... Not Only for Godzilla Fans !: I am not a Godzilla fan (I don't dislike them; I am neutral towards them). But this book is amazing even if you don't care about the movies, because like them or not, Godzilla movies are an important part of our modern culture. This book is detailed, interesting, always enlightening, and very often hilarious to read. A great book can be a pleasure to read even for those who would not be interested in the subject. This is such a book."
__label__2,"Marina has done it again!!!: When I purchased Marinas CD, Liquid Silk, I felt that she had surely reached a pinacle with regards to her music. Then I heard Snow Falling on Silence: I was wrong, she has done it again! Gentle and flowing; this CD is a fantasic follow up to Liquid Silk. Once again the sounds that she has created take the soul on a mystical journey that all should experience. Thank you, Marina!!"

__label__1,"Overwhemed by overchoice: This device very user unfriendly. It comes with three (COUNT THEM-THREE) separate manuals plus a couple of brouchures. I am still on the-how-to-use-the camera manual. The camera has literally hundreds of features but the manual is incomprehensible.I had to call customer service to figure out how to make selctions but I still don't know why I would want to make them. The manual is completely silent on why/when/for what purpose I would want to use these features. I won't even discuss how could I remember all those features if I were out actually taking pictures of something--which I haven't ventured to do. I've just stayed home taking practice shots of my cat and erasing them. HuhAfter several weeks, I have not yet ventured into the how-to-print manual or that computer disc that comes with the third manual.I asked customer service if Canon sponsors classes in how to use these little suckers. No.I am not at all pleased with this purchase."
__label__1,"Good idea, too bad it doesn't work: I have owned 2 of these, the first I purchased and returned because it quit oscillating properly after the 2nd or 3rd use. The second was given to me as a gift and while I still have the fan it quit oscillating just like the first one."
__label__1,"TERRIBLE!: As an older teen, I am sure that I am less conservative than most parents, but I am still strongly against Kidz Bop for creating their remake of mostly inappropriate songs for kids. While I personally listen to a lot of these songs, I wouldn't have my child listen to them while Kidz Bop tries to pass itself off as something fun and child-friendly. Many of them have obvious sexual messages (sung by children, which i find disturbing) and themes that young children shouldn't have to deal with. From an teen's perspective, Kidz Bop has effectively ruined many songs for me; Every time I hear them sing on commercials I cringe. Kids should listen to their own age-appropriate songs. Just because kids are singing them doesn't make this okay for kids. Think about the bad influence of some pop music which regularly deals with drugs, sex, breakups etc. Do you want your five year old, completely unaware of what it's about, to sing along to this stuff?"
__label__1,"It was moldy!: I ordered an 8 pack of this jerkey to try and stay range grown and healthy in my eating, but when I got it, it was a disaster!First, I only got one of the 8 packs I was paying for. I can't fault this jerky, but ecom's shipping folk for that. However, the bag had jerky in it that had a strange gray fungus growing on it!I was told this was good jerkey, but I guess I'll never know now. I may have gotten a very rare moldy pack, but I'll shy away from this stuff."
__label__2,"60 Feet of Pure Terror: Come on now, don't let this scare you away! If you appreciate the effort and time that's spent in movie making you'll like this movie. It was made in a short period of time and with little budget (obviously) and no gratifying theatrical debut. The commentary on this disc is really cool actually, and thankfully it's not just the filmmakers praising the movie. They realise it's not perfect. Sure, this may be about a giant snake, but it's pretty funny, sort of like the Tremors series. I think that this can be enjoyable if you're patient."
__label__2,"Another great ""Royal Diaries"" novel: ""Marie Antoinette: Princess of Versailles"" was a great fictional diary of this young princess, in her difficult lifestyle.Maria Antonia of Austria lives with her wealthy, royal family, when she hears that she is to be married - to the future king of France! She spends a busy time learning French, pages and pages of French etiquette, posing for portraits, being fitted for gowns, and trying to stop acting like the girl she is. Then she leaves for France, and doesn't know what to expect...This was a great book that really makes you feel for and understand Marie Antoinette, who later became such a terrible ruler. I'd recommend this for ages 11 and up, and I'd also definitely recommend the other Royal Diaries books."
__label__2,"Good book, could have lived without the preverted sex scenes: This was a good book, I found it and enjoyed it. But being a 12 year old, I thought the sex was unecessary and made me uncomfortable."
__label__2,"Great waterproof family tent: We've had this tent for about a year and bought it for our family of four. We've been very happy with it. It's easy to assemble, especially since there are only two cross bars. In a pinch, one person can set it up, but it's easier with two.Just recently, we camped in a massive thunderstorm with high winds and pouring rain. Our family stayed dry and our 2 1/2 year old didn't even wake up in his pack n'play. There was some water on the floor, but that was because we didn't tuck the footprint entirely underneath the floor resulting in pooling."

__label__1,"Disappointing: If I had paid 2 dollars for this, I wouldn't bother to complain.As reviewed by others, it is indeed correct that it's poorly designed : too flimsy for Dr Brown's own 8oz glass bottles!! The bottles on the picture must be a light plastic model (if it's not a computer-generated rendition), be warned: you won't be able to do that with glass bottles.And the bottom section of the rack? impossible to reach anything underneath.A cheaper substitute: your regular dish rack."

__label__1,"I Can't Give This Zero Stars: I am a professional military historian who used to appear in commercial videos like this one. They're all pretty lame, but this is just crap, the worst I've ever seen. Trust nothing it says or shows, and the film quality is awful."
__label__2,"You have to see this review!: Would you ever want to go under a bed to get a potion? Well, It Came FromBeneath the Bed by James Howe is full of mystery. This story is about a dog who wantsto become a writer just like his uncle. Delilah helps Howe save the world from a largestuffed-animal bear from eating the city. I liked this book a lot. It was good because it was funny and interesting. I don't really have a favorite part because the whole book isgood. Read more to find out."
__label__1,"Full of Discrepancies: I read the review of Thea and I agree whole-heartedly that the book was filled with discrepancies. When the book mentioned Fraser's brothers, Alexander (Arabella's twin) was left out of the book. In the Highlander, Arabella and Alexander were inseparable. Thea's review sums up the rest of the discreapancies quite accurately."
__label__1,"bad intro...: Don't let the one star fool you, I am a big Bruce Cockburn(CO-BURN) fan. I am writing this primarily to those who may not be familiar with his work, and are considering this collection as an introduction. This is NOT a good album to start listening to Cockburn. Bruce has never really been a ""hit singles"" oriented artist. ""Wondering Where the Lions Are"" went to #24 on Billboard in 1980 and remains his only chart single to this day. Cockburn's artistry is far more evident in live performance, and any of his live albums would make a better intro. Better yet, check out his show if he is on tour. For studio albums, try some early 70s work like High Winds White Sky and Sunwheel Dance, or anything he's done since 1990. There are some good songs here (Night Train, Last Night of the World), but the eighties were not Bruce's best decade and some of the arrangements sound very cheesy now."

__label__2,"decent price for the item: I bought it @ $16.95 for this set on ecom. W/ tax it was about $20?the opener is quite tall & large compared to several other ones I've seen in store. about the size of an actual bottle of wine. If you don't mind the size, then I guess it's ok.The chiller is very handy. Since we have a wine chiller @ home already, we just use this little chiller as our ice bucket. Very sleek looking.My friend got one from Costco for about $30, it's black, super compact, & does the exact job. Looks a lot nicer to. I guess you get what you pay for. But for the price, I can't complain @ all. It does the job & doesn't look that bad after all."
__label__1,I didn't like it: This is my first book by Alice Hoffman and I just wasn't that crazy about it. I thought that it moved rather slowly at times and I really would have liked to have read more about Ethan's thoughts along with more dialog exchanged between him and Jorie. I thought that Jorie's character was a weak one and I didn't like the character of Kat at all. A disappointing read for me.

__label__2,"Still Funny!: For fans of early British humor and pre-Monty Python, this is worth including in your collection, even though the quality of the recording is not the best. With his college friends, my husband saw a production in Chicago during the ""Fringe"" American tour. Several sketches he saw in the original show are not on this recording, and he misses those. But this brings back fond memories, and many laughs, of that live performance."

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. This product, once it finally decided to set itself up after numerous attempts, crippled Internet bandwidth capability to pre dial-up speeds, locked up PC's, and required electrical power reboots after several hours on the device to restore network communication. If you use broadbandsatellite internet/e-mail with a WAP, DO NOT USE A WRE54G."
__label__2,"Very well thought out anime: Solid in all respects from the animation to the audio. The story line is about a kid who is a math whiz who gets an email having a very long series of seemingly random letters and numbers in it, and without considering anything or seeing who sent it, breaks the code and sends the result back to its sender, with a typo thus getting his avatar and account jacked. This causes everyone to assume him to be the author of a hostile takeover of a virtual world... and telling the rest would spoil it.I highly recommend purchasing this for your own collection.Well worth the price."
__label__1,"Terrible: What a waste of time. They must have offered Tom And Nicole a lot of money to start in this garbage. I continued watching the movie hoping in would get better. boy, was I wrong. Althought i will admit it has a couple of very sensous scenes, but still not worth wasting your time and money."
__label__2,"This is one of the best Boxcar Children books!!: We (Sarah & Casey) had been reading other Boxcar Children Mysteries, when we decided to find out how it all started.

I saw the cover and with all the high rating I figured cover looks fun, might have routines where your joints will be flexed, exercise will be applied repetition and strength will be obtain . Ohh was I wrong. It just scott sonnon in an empty room solo telling you and showing you some totally boring exercises . what a waste of money . Maybe if your an elderly , or middle age individual I'm sure it might work for you , but even then you should challenge yourself. The saying ""there's something for everyone "" surely didn't apply to me . There was nothing for me with this dvd."
__label__2,"best toy: You can buy other hard-to-destroy toys, but they are often made out of hard rubber...my dogs aren't interested in those. They want to play (and destroy) plush toys.Given that it takes less than 20 minutes for my young smooth collie (50 pounds) to destroy a regular plush dog toy (find the squeaky! find the squeaky! FIND THE SQUEAKY!), that hardly makes them worth the money. She has ripped apart toys my older rough collie has had the better part of a decade.However, this is one toy she hasn't killed yet. AND, unlike Kong toys and other hard rubber things, they both LOVE playing with it, chewing on it, playing tug of war and keep-away with each other, etc.Will buy more of these. Great stuff."

What this means is that you can't plug it into the USB port on your keyboard and expect it to mount on your desktop. it won't... you'll get an error message stating there's not enough power. You literally have to crawl around the back of your entire machine and plug it into the USB port there.

If you get the 128 MB version of this product, you can plug it into your keyboard.)This product works just fine on Macintosh. [...]"
__label__2,"Heart AND Soul: After years of enduring rap/hip hop, finally we see an authentic return to 1960s R&B;/soul, albeit from a nerdy white boy. This CD is a gem.The real sleeper on this album is the cover of the obscure Marvin Gaye song, ""Where I Lay My Hat."" Giving Mr. Gaye, a legend, his props, this cover is superior to the original, which is saying a lot.The feeling -- the heart and soul -- on this CD just oozes authenticity. After listening to the clinical pop spewed out by much of the industry for years, it's refreshing to hear music again that is sung from the heart.I've watched Mr. Hicks perform ""The Runaround"" to standing ovations on shows from Leno to The View so far. His enthusiasm and love of music is infectuous. Hopefully, America and the world will embrace this return to the roots of American music.Bravo."
__label__2,"Has it all...except one thing: This could be one of the greatest hard rock/metal bands. They've got a great sound, great lyrics, great passion for Christ, yet Mark Soloman's voice doesn't quite go with the rest. He needs some vocal coaching. It's obviously a strain to hit the higher notes and he comes off sounding like a cross between that whiny Robert Smith and a constipated Ozzy Osbourne. If you could imagine a voice like Chris Cornell in there, then Stavesacre would go down as one of the greatest bands in recent memory. But they're doing the Lord's work, and that's fine by me! Bless them."
__label__2,"THIS JOINT WAS PHAT.: This is one of the best CD's that I've heard in a long time. The Roots and Erykah Badu sound great together in ""You Got Me.""

__label__2,"""Curly"" Still Going Strong: This fourth volume of the Three Stooges collection again showcases the hilarious slapstick comedy of Moe, Larry, and Curly. Although a few episodes in this set are a little stale due to a recycling of old ideas, for the most part they are as hilarious as all the others preceding them!Of course, at this point in the release of this collection, most Stooges fans are probably wondering when they, sadly, will begin seeing the effects of Curly Howard's mini-strokes, which led him to become a shell of his former self both on and off screen. However, only the very beginning of Curly's mini-strokes can be seen in this collection, and even then it is only in the final 3-4 shorts (which are still hilarious!)So, buy this product confidently knowing that you are still getting the best of the ""Curly"" shorts."
__label__1,"Sorry but I cannot recommend it: I am used to buy a lot of good books from ecom, but this time I had bought this book without waiting for other opinion about, so I think I have to inform that this book is really useless if you are looking for ideas or tutorial regarding integration between the two programs. Really a basic level targeted book, with nothing useful for intermediate/advanced users."

__label__1,"Obvious Differences: I have this toaster, purchased it last year. Takes FOREVER to toast bread. It is pretty obvious from reading the reviews that Black and Decker has handed the actual manufacturing of this product over to someone else. Had I purchased this 10 or so years ago, it probably would be still working wonderfully. However, as mine is one of the new versions, it would be faster to toast bread by rubbing two sticks together."

__label__2,"EXCELLENT BOOK!: I had thought this book was another armeggedon thing, but when I actually read it, I was hooked! This book totally changed the way I looked at the power of a praying saint. I think God really used Frank to send a message: We, as believers, have full access to His power through prayer- if we ask right. He will not leave us, and if Jesus is IN us, the Father's angels will never leave us. I also enjoyed the use of the different nationalities given to the angels, as well as the attitudes (my favorites were Cree and Chimon). It really made the book. Of course you know Who is going to win the war: but sometimes the battles require more prayer and work than we usually want to give. Praise God for His Love and His Son! The bottom line of this review is: THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!"

__label__1,"Dangerously wrong when it comes to breastfeeding: It's worth noting that the American Academy of Pediatricians disagrees with much of what Ms. Hogg states in this book - specifically, she feels that babies shoud not be fed on demand, that formula is just as good as breastmilk, and that breastfeeding past 6 months is usually for the mom and not for the baby.I received this book as a gift - and I found it worthless. Don't bother. Dr. Sears' The Baby Book is a MUCH better resource, and is better respected. I also disagreed completely with her ideas about a schedule (ha!) for a newborn, co-sleeping, and attachment parenting."
__label__1,"Bad, bad, bad: I have seen almost all of the IMAX DVDs, and this is by far the worst of the bunch. The back and forth narration of the child and ""wise"" sage is boring and annoying, and most of the scenes don't work well. Don't pick this title up."

A couple of reviewers warned that it was not to be used with an extension cord, but Cuisinart has apparently revised directions. As long as the cord can support the 1000w pot, it is safe to use. I have a very heavy duty cord, 1625w, that I use with my iron, and this will work with the fondue. I am looking forward to recreating the fun we had 35 years ago, when I was single, with friends and fondue. I have always had great results with any Cuisinart appliance in my kitchen."

__label__2,"Not Sure About Durability but Size, Price & Layout Is Perfect: I ordered the tri-fold eel skin wallet sold on ecom and it was way too small. More than 2 credit cards and it wouldn't even fold over. This one is larger, yet thinner (one fold), credit cards fit easily, and they are loose enough to pull in & out. My old leather wallet used to gunk up the credit cards & license window with (I guess) leather tanning stuff. So far no rub offs from the eel skin, but time will tell. The workmanship & quality look to be excellent, but time will tell on that too. However, for the price, design & butt friendliness, I give this wallet 5 stars."
__label__1,Dex is alive or not?: Unlike most of R.L Stines books this one was my least favorite of them all. This book takes place at Midwood highschool and a girl named joanna wants to break up with her boyfriend but before she as the chance he boyfriend falls off a cliff and dies or is alive i dont know which one because he keeps on dyeing that by the end of the book you dont really care if he is dead or alive.The major charters are joanna and dex the boy who dies. the problem in the story is that before she has the chance to break up with him and then he dies but he comes back from the dead for one last date and finds out that she wants to break up with him and tryes to kill her.The novel is fiction.
__label__1,Didn't work at all.: I kept breaking out! I wouldn't recommend this. Try the cleansing pads from Say Yes To Tomatoes. They actually work!

__label__1,"Different version for the same item??: I bought one of these about a year ago, and bookmarked it so I could always come back and buy a duplicate. I just received my 2nd order of this today, and it's slightly different. The handle isn't fully leather, so it's not as stiff as the original book I ordered, and when you open it, the sides feel like the vinyl version of this book, so those things really kill it for me. It's a shame. I don't feel like going through the process of shipping it back because it's not the end of the world, but what is the deal with updating a product without updating the product page?"
__label__1,"missing information: In this set it does not contain any information on Dick York even though this is his last season on the series as Darrin. However, they did put in an informercial in Spainish before each show on the later disc's with no english translation at all.A little back ground on Dick Yorks years as Darrin would have been a great bonus but alas not to be."

__label__1,"Better things would come with ""Mezzanine"": This overrated album doesn`t do much for me. I don`t really see what`s so special about it, and I believe it`s the band`s worse record. The title song is a good opener, and ""Karmakoma"" is a great moment as well, but after the third track, ""Three"", it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record. The last song, a cover of ""Light my fire"", is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album, ""Protection"" is alright as background music, but not much else."
__label__1,"Not Comprehensive, Incomplete, Some Errors: This book is a mixed bag. It is a usable resource on non-Greek/Roman mythology, but is marred by the author's essays in regard to the Greek/Roman mythos. Baumgartner's views aren't necessarily invalid and may be an attempt at humor, but personal opinions and humorously incomplete writing have no place in a book calling itself a ""dictionary."" This is *all* she says about Perseus, one of the most-written about Greek heros: ""Son of Zeus and Danae. He cut off the head of the gorgon Medusa, who was minding her own business at the time, and gave the head to Athena. This disgusting homicide won him acclaim and honor."" Real funny, huh? It gets worse. This is an example of an error: ""Maia - Greek: Daughter of Atlas and Pleione. Mother of Herakles by Zeus."" Wrong. Should say mother of Hermes. Herakles' mother was Almene. Only use this book as a last resort. Buyer beware."
__label__1,Disappointed: This sounded to me like gospel wannabes. Maybe one or two songs met my expectations. Even the quality of the sound recording was tinny sounding to my ear.

Once assembled, the doggie door does not close and the gate does not pressure fit in doorway. Completely useless."

This is an incredibly poor design that the company refuses to tweak by building in an ON OFF switch (G_d forbid they should spend an extra 50 cents to make a safer product). This is a piece _f ___t and there are better out there. I went back to an older unit by another company which had the decency and concern for other human beings enough to put in an ON OFF switch.

__label__2,"Solid Rock Worship Album: Building 429 hit the scene big with their debut single Glory Defined and their solid debut album The Space In Between Us. Their style had a bit of grunge mixed with solid worship lyrics, fitting since the band name is based on Ephesians 4:29, which is a great life verse. After much acclaim and a Dove Award for Best New Artist 2005, Building 429 came back with a somewhat more rocking Rise, with the hit song Fearless.Iris To Iris is the third and final Building 429 album on Word Records and is actually my favorite overall. The band certainly toned down and the grunge influence seems gone. This album is easily the most worship focused as evidenced by the stand-out songs Power Of Your Name, Majesty, You Carried Me and a great re-write of Grace That Is Greater. My favorite overall song is Singing Over Me, based on Zephaniah 3:17. This is a solid rock worship album and if you like Jeremy Camp, Casting Crowns or MercyMe, you should enjoy Building 429."

__label__2,"Loved it so much I searched for another...: This hair dryer no doubt made a visable difference in taming the fresh blow dried, frizzy look. The settings and attachments were all I needed plus and I have a ton of thick hair to dry. My only complaint would be that my first purchase of this dryer lasted only about two years or less and I expected more with a 4 yr. warrantied product but the working performance took me right back to it anyway. At least this time I only paid $19.99, half the price, I guess since it's now an ""older"" model as opposed to the $44.00 I paid for it when it first came out but honestly it is the best hair dryer I've ever used! Oh and super fast shipping from Shaver Outlet!"
__label__1,Broken Plastic: Just like the other reviews i received the tag plate covers and one of the two i received was cracked and broken. I should have listen to the reviews but wanted to try it out anyway for the price. Only good thing is received the item on time. I wouldn't recommand this item to anyone its very cheaply made.

__label__1,"It started out with promise...: Eyewitness has a lot of material out there and this dvd seemed to have promise. It is mostly geared to the late elementary level, but is evolutionary in slant and at one point shows girls running down the beach in thongs - definitely not for the elementary age and I wouldn't show this to even high schoolers - seriously not appropriate for a dvd that is trying to be educational and go through the body systems."
__label__1,"review of smokes: This book depressed me greatly. It proves to this reader that the academy has taken over. This book is impenetrable, verbose, and cold. Susan Wheeler is the type of poet who is always saying, 'Hey look at me, look at how clever I am.' The work is empty of humanity. It is the kind of poetry that graduate students on so-called writing programs spend days discussing what they actually signify. It is poetry for the academic elites who jet from one writing program to another. The reader who believes poetry to be more than shallow verbal pyrotechnics will be disappointed by this book.Who reads this stuff? The mind boggles."

When you read, you will find Steve Harmon to be a heart winning character--Andrew Meyer and Grant Carden, New York Times"
__label__2,Salt lamps: Got 2 sets of 2 salt lamps (4 in all). One set the lamps were different colors. Three lamps had totally broken bulbs and one had a smashed socket. Paid a lot for shipping too. Otherwise lamps are nice. Too late to send back as these were presents. Will find a new socket and already got new bulbs. They were priced right so not worth sending back as a new set might come the same way.
__label__1,"Not the Lucinda I'm used to...: I'm surprised to see the positive reviews. I own several of Lucinda's CDs -- Car Wheels, Essence, Happy Woman Blues, and Lucinda Williams. I didn't feel like this CD was ANYTHING like the others. I'm very disappointed with it.As with most of what Lucinda has written, her words are very powerful. However, I think she was reaching out for something different in this CD, and it just doesn't do it for me. I'm hoping that over time I grow to appreciate this CD but I'm not there yet. I'd suggest that you save your money for something else!"
__label__2,"Forget 'Twilight' - this is the movie you have to see!: You can call this a vampire movie. But its not like any other one that you've ever seen. Maybe a coming-of-age story. Or even a ""two lonely outsiders find each other"" story. It's all of those and more, and it's gonna make my ""best of"" list for 2008. This is a haunting, beautiful tale of two 12-year-olds - the boy is a loner who gets beaten up regularly by the school bully. The girl is a vampire who moves in next door. The feel of the movie almost reminds me of Sophia Coppola's 'The Virgin Suicides', with a beatiful melancholy to it. I don't want to hype it up too much, lest you be disappointed, but put this one at the top of your list."
__label__1,"PESIMO!!: Pense que era una muy buena compra ya que la marca es bien reconocida. El primer defecto que le note fue que era muy ruidoso, pero trate de ignorarlo confiando que iba a resultarme bueno por su marca. A las dos semanas de usarlo a la copa para el seno se le abrieron grietas en el plastico, haciendo dificil poder succionar bien. Luego que logre conseguir el repuesto de la pieza, me sucedio que tres semanas despues no se por cual razon, dejo de succionar con fuerza y a dura pena lograba sacarme en 15 minutos 1 y 1/2 onzas cuando normalmente me sacaba 4 onzas en 10 minutos. Siento que para el valor del producto $79.99 fue una terrible compra ya que termine comprandome uno nuevo de distinta marca. Espero tener mejor suerte pues mi bebe apenas tiene 5 semanas y me falta mucho tiempo por delante de usar este aparato."
__label__2,"Babysitter wanted: This book was riveting. Mr. Carr could have done less background writing (for those who have read the Alienist), but it does help if you read this one first. What I loved most about The Angel of Darkness, was the vivid picture painted by the author-as a history buff-it brought New York alive in a time long passed. The fact that children are involved did bother me, as a mother, but the mystery reader in me-put it all aside. I reccommend this book (and the Alienist)."

Now I must redeem myself and purchase a better set. Do not buy this piece of junk."
__label__2,"Very Unique and Beautiful Movie: It was my privilege to see this movie at this year's National Puppetry Festival in Saint Paul, MN. Being a marionette puppeteer myself, the movement that these puppets were able to accomplish astonished me. It is very apparent that Bernd Ogrodnik and the other skilled puppeteers on this movie were extremely passionate about their work. I also found the symbolism and the story interesting, as well. I don't recommend this movie for children, however...it was definitely created for adults. If you are a marionette enthusiast or you're looking for an escape from the usual boring movie experience, watch this movie. It is well worth it."
__label__1,"Too explanatory...: While Madonna has chosen a wonderful character trait to highlight in ""Mr. Peabody's Apples"", I believe that she tries to over-explain the moral of the story rather than giving the child a chance to think for himself.All in all, my five year old son (who devours books) was quite apathetic to the whole plot and found the writing to be too simplistic in relation to the bold and thought provoking illustrations rendered by the, obviously talented, Loren Long."

And it seems to me that Burrich's death was there only to offer Fitz a ""clean way out"" without betraying the man who had raised him as a father (this death -the way it is- is maybe the only flaw I found in Hobb's trilogies)."

__label__1,"Not quite good.: The book feels mixed. By this, I mean that the diction often times feels too high for kids, and at other times dialogue and events feel like too much of a cliche for adults. Personally though, I felt like this book overall was a throw away project. The plot, world, and concept all felt as though they were cobbled together from other well know fantasy novels, a little bit of Gaiman, a dash of Tolkein kind of feel. Furthermore, I often felt as if the author didn't trust the reader to quite get the various reference in the book, which would have been to the books benefit, so he instead forced the references down the readers throat killing any fun out of those that understood it right from the beginning. I must, however, give credit for the use of baseball which was unique and interesting, but even this wasn't enough for me to say this book was good."

They sit attached to the bottom of a shelf, out of sight, in the appliance garage and are always readily available. Be sure to bend the stack in a couple directions before putting them in the Pop-a-Plate holder so that the plates are available one at a time. The shipping was as much as the product, but all told, it was under $12, and well worth it for us."
__label__1,"very thin and aluminum rivet: The lid works well as a substitute for a glass lid and fits perfectly for lodge 10.25"" skillet. However, the material is super thin and light-weighted. The lid feels cheap which probably justifies the lower price comparing to other brands. It's definitely not ""heavy"" or ""durable"" or ""professional-grade"" as advertised. The rolled-over edge makes it hard to clean. But my major concern is that there are no stainless steel caps on top of the aluminum rivets, which defeats the purpose of having a stainless steel lid as opposed to an aluminum one that costs less. Aluminum easily reacts to whatever it comes in contact with. In short, if you just want an additional lid without spending much, it's a good price. But I will not buy it again because of my concern about aluminum."

Don't bother buying it for your niece or grandaughter about to graduate from college as they will easily see through this drivel.

Not sure if I am the only one that feels this way, but it seemed like most of the questions on the actual TEA were nothing like the practice tests in the study guide. To the guides credit, it does mention the actual test is harder, but it still hardly prepares one for the test. Not sure if I would recommend purchasing this guide. Shop around diligently first!!"
__label__1,"Not happy, not happy at all: I am not happy with this camera for many reasons: first off it has no optical zoom, it takes forever to save a picture, so you can not take a series of pics, it gives alot of red eye even when they option has been chosen for no red eye, the batteries run out quickly even the rechargeable, and about 70% of the time I can't take a picture at all. I called and was told that I had to hold the button down half way to focus, then all the way. Well I try and try and try and try and miss so many good pictures!!! I will never buy anything Canon again."
__label__2,"Top Notch Sound...: This CD was not like the other Star Wars CD's that I have listened to. It seems more modern. I especially like the Deul of the Fates, it sounds very mystrious... Well Thats all I have to say"
__label__1,"Arrived Broken as Well: I received my slicer with the wire broken. And some of the marble was chipped off around where the wire lies. Seems like it would be a good product, but doesn't seem to be very well protected in the packaging."
__label__1,"Disappointing..: I'm a true fan of the first Leprechaun movie. Warwick Davis and Jennifer Aniston really make this film great. The humor interlaced with the story is hilarious. A true cult classic. Obviously filmed on a limited budget, the characters are written with some decent depth. As much depth as would be expected anyways. Believing that the sequels would be worth the cost of buying the boxed set, I purchased them. Sadly mistaken, I wasted my money. 2-5 are some of the worst written movies I've ever seen. Not to mention you don't recognize a single actor until Part 5 where Ice-T and Coolio come into play. They're ...not worth buying. Buy the original. Love it, watch it often. Rent the rest. And be glad you saved your money."
__label__2,"THE runner's book for women new to the sport.: The first time I tried to go running I was 17 and didn't know what I was doing. My friend and I ran for an hour, were terribly sore the next day, and that was the end of that. When I was 30 I picked up this book, and when I finished it I knew enough to start running and stay with it for 6 years until a knee injury stopped me.If you are an experienced runner, there are plenty of other specialty books and magazines that will be more interesting and fill in more detail, but if you have never run before, this is the book to start with, written from a woman's point of view. It will give you enough confidence and information to go out there and get started and see if this is the sport for you."
__label__2,"What do you want?: Come on its not as if Pam said it was shakespear. From the beginning she said it was going top be a lot of fun, and that it was. Pam is Pam and of course at the time she was the perfect vechial for making money. It wont appeal to a wide audience but it fulfills its purpose, lets face it even if it had of been on par with hamlet a large majority of people still wouldnt have went to see it simply because of Pambo. Now an adaptation of Hamlet starring Pam called Pamlet might be what the hardened cynics want. Barb Wire is just fun and is entertaining to watch, watching it with this in mind you will see my point, just enjoy the movie and the DVD extras are a bonus."
__label__1,"Great Door Prizes: This a very basic offering with knives of questionable quality.If you are intersting in giving away door prizes or using them as stocking stuffers, this may be a good choice.I wouldn't trust these knives in any outdoor or survival situation.These babies will make great gifts for the in-laws and anyone else you don't really care about."
__label__2,"Good for everything!: I love these! I don't have a baby but I can imagine that they are gentle and effeective. I use these for everything: Taking off my makeup at night, a quick refreshing clean up on a hot summer day, a face wipe if I am rushed in the morning (which is always), wiping my feet, wiping down the toilet seat and counter tops in the bathroom, and of course for ""personal"" use. These are gentle, effective, and environmentally friendly. I buy them on ecom because of the great price and because I use them all of the time so buying them in bulk is a good idea! The best part... They don't have that awful baby butt smell!"
__label__1,"Bad Back Booster: Having a bad back, I was looking for anything that would help the pain. I watched the infomercial and was impressed with the product. I ordered the item and it was received with great expectations. It took very little effort to inflate and I was ready to use it. It stayed inflated for about two to three hours but gradually lost its firmness as it began to deflate. It obviously had a leak. Contacted ecom and they authorized a return.Have since pruchased another product (considerably more expensive) made from memory foam and it it's super."
__label__2,"A must read!: It is difficult to write a review for a book that is so well written, so unbelievably relevant and important, that makes you feel humble as you try to form a clear concise sentence the way only Wendell Berry can. He is our modern day Mark Twain! Thank you, Mr. Berry, for saying what needs to be said!"
__label__1,"Disappointing: I have always enjoyed Frampton's work, but was disappointed with this dvd. Though there are some good performances from Peter and the band, I don't feel this is their best performance. I own quite a number of concert dvds; and this one ranks very low. The lighting and sound quality are not great, and the video editing is the worst I've ever seen, as noted in other reviews. I own Live In Detroit on audio c.d. and I feel that is a better performance. I will probably buy that DVD in hopes that it is better."
__label__2,"THE BEST Straight to DVD Releases from Disney.: When Aladdin II Return of Jafar came out years ago, I thought that the idea that Disney would release some of their films straight to the consumer was a sour one. Aladdin III did not help change that opinion to much though it was better. Mulan II is by far the best Straight to DVD/VHS release Disney has ever done. Why on earth did they not release it to theaters as well though. The story is funny, thought provoking, and above all flawless. It is a shame it is not longer. The songs are also great, but then Disney is well known for combining lyrical song with story very well, at least in most cases."
__label__1,"[aweful]: This is probably the most ill-formed book in general I have ever read, not to mention the worst grow book, period. The illustrations are CHEESY.The photographs are of poor quality, you can barely discern them. The information is general, contradictory, unorganized... I wouln't trust a thing in it, which is strange because Jorge Cervantes is a genius, and his previous publications prove his skill. But this book is a no-no. Go for another, and don't be afraid to spend the bucks. You want climate matched with plant variety with specific feeding instructions, and plenty of do's and dont's. If your info is poor then your fruit will suffer."
__label__1,"Flops like a Fish: Contains precious little information about fishing, i.e. you're not going to learn much, and overall, it's just irritating...just like it's namesake. Iaconelli refers to himself as a ""tatted-out break-dancing"" rebel, lol...if I did that type of dancing, I wouldn't brag about it. A total waste of time and money."
__label__1,"Drek: This film was recently watched by the entire cast of my college play after the leader of the group watched it and was so amazed that he got everyone together and watched it probably to make him feel that he didn't waste his money on the rental. What was scary was his interpretation of the movie and recalling the certain elements. Eventually, after describing the movie to many different people in order to finally get them to come, it went from a bad movie to a gloriously over the top movie. I'm sorry, it's just a terrible movie. That's all I can say. One of the worst excuses to make a film in the history of film. Really bad plot and everything. It's a cheap horror/splatter film without the gusto of a genius like Peter Jackson, when he actually put lots energy into his films instead of making them overbloated bastardized versions of books and cheap Hollywood classic remakes. So please don't see this film."
__label__1,"Equating Science with Communism: The very first scene in this movie shows you all you need to know: the Wall going up in East Germany by the communists. And Stein really wants me to believe that people who believe in evolution are like the communists ? It is not only non-sensical, but to me, very offensive. I have been in East Germany and I consider myself a Reagan conservative. This analogy between the Soviets - who murdered dissenters, and scientists, is cheap, ridiculous, and offensive."
__label__2,"TV-Monitor Cable: If you want to watch video from a computer on a second computer monitor or TV set used as a monitor, you need this cable to transfer the voice along with the picture. It does that well and at a low price. The cable is heavy duty, which I like, but it will not appeal to those who want a very flexible cable."
__label__1,"Runs VERY small.: Purchased for a friend who wears an XL in everything else without a problem, had to return the shirt, it barely came close to fitting. Make sure you order at least 1 size up!"
__label__1,"Difficult read: I feel like the odd one out here, unlike the other reviews I was not impressed by the writing in this book. It took forever to read this because it was written poorly. The beginning is slow and the author throws so many names, dates, and sub-plots into the story that I found my self rereading several pages in order to figure out who was who."
__label__1,"Love the movie, do not love this product: This movie played 2 times before it wouldn't play anymore. It's not my DVD player, that works fine. Disappointed. Buy this elsewhere."
__label__2,"Works very well but not an easy project: I bought this for my Freud 3-1/4 HP plunge router on a Jessem Rout-n-Slide router table. Putting it together proved to be a fairly intense process, including a difficult job of forcing four small compression locking pins onto the legs of the router. However, when I managed to finish installing the Router Raizer on the router, it is really wonderfully easy to raise or lower the bit using the deceptively simple handle bar. I recommend it highly if you don't mind a complex installation."
__label__2,"Enjoyable: A nice, snappy little horror novel that moves along at a quick pace. The elements come together to make a pretty absorbing read for a rainy day. Dank underground caves, people transformed into hideous monsters, behemoth bloodthirsty crab creatures, and infectious paranoia. The limits of believability are stretched a bit in some parts, but that's okay if you can suspend disbelief and just go with the story. I found myself swept away as if on an icy underground current, for a few hours anyway."
__label__1,"The new ""fit"" drives me crazy!: I ordered two of these about a year ago. The reduction of seven belt loops to five was very inconvenient, with my belt constantly riding above my trousers at the left and rght rear. But what was really irritating was that I was constantly pulling up my pants. I thought it was just me, or that my shape had changed. Then I learned that the ""rise"" was now shorter than it used to be and that they ride lower, which doesn't feel right and I don't like. Maybe the young crowd likes this. I've worn levis' jeans for forty years, but I don't like the new cut. Someone in their review mentioned Carhartt's jeans, which I tried and they feel like the old levis. I just ordered another pair of them."
__label__1,"Kind of a letdown :(: I was a little bummed. Usually I find myself laughing from start to finish, but not this time. Just MY opinion; there were some good laughing times but ALOT more singing than there usually is."
__label__1,"Don't believe the hype!!: Well, Well, Well, here goes another one. My girl's book club picked your book to discuss this month and my girl gave me your book to read. I am not in the least bit impressed. Mr. Crutcher, you supposedly wrote a book about the games men play. Brother, I am assuming you are black, do me a favor and get a real job. You give a lot of useless information about men. I am sorry to say this has got to be the worst book I have ever read. If you decide to write more books please stick to a topic you know about."
__label__2,"OVERKILL:BETTER THAN EVER: Greetings from the other side: Forget those posers,this is REAL metal.I agree with other reviewers that this is one of Overkill's best if not thee best effort to date. Released after 'Feel the fire' and before 'Necroshine', this album is produced well from first track to the last. This album is not for new Metallica listeners or Limp Jizdick fans. Its fast, ferocious and unrelenting speed metal.(with the exception of 'Promise' which belongs on a Motley Crue album) Some say they are similar in style to Slayer, but I feel they have developed their own style thats honed to perfection on this record. Buy or Die!"
__label__1,"Sanus Speaker Stand Review: The product quality is mediocre at best. The do hold the speaker off the floor, but that's about it. The particle board is among the worst I've ever seen. The advertisement was dead wrong. A picture of one stand in the ad is completely misleading, so I bought 2. Only to find that I got 4. So now what am I going to do with an extra set of cheap speaker stands? I supposed I'll wait for one to break and I'll have back-ups?"
__label__2,Great book: This book held my interest from beginning to end. I felt compassion for the main character and liked how the book made me think. There's a nice book club guide at the end as well.
__label__1,UNHAPPY and DISPLEASED: I ordered the product that is shown in the image (BLACK CAN) but i received a totally different product. contacted shipper and they never sent me a return label and I called them three times. Now I am stuck with multiple cans of a deoderant that no-one I know uses. I will never buy from ecom again.
__label__2,Terrific: I have used the thermometer several times and love it. Finally I can grill and know that the meat is done without feeling like I have to overdo it.
__label__1,"NBC - No Body Cares: NBC's coverage was terrible, no live coverage of opening ceremony with items cut, closing ceremony with half of it cut. Items missed during the actaul events due to adverts and many sports not even mentioned.I for one am waiting for the BBC version"
__label__2,"I love this CD: I love Mest....I've seen them in concert, and they're awesome. Tony is great. This is the 3rd CD and I think it's pretty kickass. Sure, some of the songs aren't so lyrically great, but it's fun to listen to. The songs that stand out are ""Drawing Board"" (who doesn't like this song?) ""Cadillac"" (for you people with some ghetto in you) and ""Yesterday"" (vocals by Jeremiah, sounds awesome).Some of the weirder songs are ""Reason"" and the hidden track. They're both cool, just...too jamacian. Oh well, I still listen to them.If you want a nice variety in music and fun music to listen to whenever, get this CD.Whether they're punk, pop-punk, or pop-rock, they're good."
__label__2,"What a great product!: We purchased this when our daughter decided she was ready to get rid of the pull ups at night. This was the best reviewed product by parents and we liked the different colors and settings available. Sure enough, we used it for three weeks and, with only one accident, she is now dry at night with no monitor. The sound bothered her, so we use the vibration setting, and this worked very well. GREAT PRODUCT!"
__label__1,ecom sent the wrong product: ecom sent me the 32F46 not-flat CRT TV. They would not honor the price they advertised for the 32DF46. I didn't want what they sent me.
__label__1,"Not recommended: I've got around 30 Zorn CDs, but sold this one on eBay (thanks, whomever you were!). Gotta say, I wanted to like this one--the cover art and liner notes made it sound like other Zorn albums that I love. Unfortunately, um, no.I'd have to put this in the listen-proof category. Not that it's grindcore or anything--just that the sounds are very unstructured and unpleasant. It's like an electronic-avant garde student effort, where the student is trying hard to make folks leave the room. Much like I did, when I was a student. But I woudn't want to listen to me either."
__label__2,"Very good but...: Love the small size and fast startup time, as well as the ability to manipulate manual controls if you want. A couple of things that I miss from my previous Canon Digital Elph: 1- there is no TV (RCA connector) hookup. This is a really nice feature so you can come home and quickly do a slide show on the TV. 2- the charger cable is almost as big as the charger. Again, Canon did it right; the slightly larger charger has prongs built right in, no cord to tie up or tangle.Otherwise, nice small, feature-packed package with 3mp capability."
__label__2,"Fascinating, very helpful: I like reading about cultural backgrounds of sex topis, such as impotence and masturbation. This book provides a very fascinating and informative account of how masturbation has been vilified and denigrated over the ages, and can, will and should go very far in helping people overcome inhibitions and culturally negative and unhelpful attitudes. Masturbation can be very constructive and helpful towards teaching and helping people have orgasms in sexual relationships. Masturbation should not be an either/or, related to intercourse or interpersonal sex. It should be thought of as a person can eat alone, or eat with others."
__label__2,"If you dont have it you haven't lived!!!!!!!: A must have. Headlined by ""We're not gonna take it"" and, my personnal favorite, ""I wanna rock."" Delivers raw intense metal, which well defines the mid 80's rock scene."
__label__2,"Worth buying - best study guide for FrontPage certification: David's book is an excellant introduction to FrontPage 98, andwill help you obtain you MCP. The questions at the end of the chapter, and his two excellant web sites, provide an good review of FrontPage. However, do not make this your only source for studying. The questions on the exam are difficult, and this book does not cover in-depth all the information needed, at the difficulty level encoutered on the test, to pass."
__label__1,"Not odor free for my cat: This box is a nice sturdy plastic, but unfortunately I have found that it is not odor-free. I live in a 540 sq ft studio in Manhattan with one cat, and you can smell what's in the box as soon as you walk into the apartment. I change the litter every few days, and I've tried different types of litter, but that hasn't helped. I think I'm going to try the CleverCat box, which my boyfriend recommends. If anyone wants to buy this box from me, I've only had it about a month and would be happy to re-sell. (Based on the reviews, it does seem to work for some folks.)"
__label__2,"Good price for a decent product: For about 2$, this product proves to be reliable and sturdy. Unless you're very good at discerning the minor details, you probably can't find the difference between this and a top of the line HDMI cable. If you need a cable badly but also cheaply, get this, it's worth the money."
__label__2,"Blu-ray snob: I'm not going to let a few changes that are heart wrenching destroy my enjoyment of the series on Blu-ray. At least I have the slightly less altered versions on DVD to fall back on. I'm sure the improved sound and picture will be enough to overcome the alterations.*** UpdateI had my first look at episode IV and I must say that it's the most beautiful way to experience it outside of the movie theater even with Obi-Wan's scream to scare off the sand people. I have a 65"" screen and an Onkyo THX receiver with a 7.1 speaker setup and the sound mix is awesome. I feel that blasters are about to shoot me in the back of the head. I grew up watching these movies and that alone justifies the expense of experiencing the movies in optimal conditions."
__label__2,"Through the Eyes of a Child: An introduction to Children's literature: This book has a TON of information on different types of children's literature. I had to purchase this book for a class, but it has tons of list of books that are good books to read."
__label__1,"Complete rip off: I cannot imagine why a publisher agreed to publish this book. Of the purported 166 pages of text, from page 69 onwards are the text of three speeches to Congress. Of the 60 pages before that, every second page is a poorly reproduced picture. The result is that there is only 30 pages of actual material, and those are written in large font.The book stats show that there are 5647 words in total in this book - maybe enough for a first year tax essay, but he would have failed on content. There is nothing to learn from this waste of paper. It should have been 15 pages long and given away as a pamphlet.Save your money."
__label__1,"another disappointing Wilton product: As other reviews have stated, this does not cut straight, pulls the fondants, unscrews, etc. Much easier to use a ruler and pastry cutter."
__label__1,They changed these and now they are so flimsy!: They just changed this product and now it is so much harder to use. The strips bend so do not adhere to the wooden sticks. I was pleased with the product before but now I just feel jipped.
__label__1,"Why fix it if it ain't broke !: I was expecting a compilation of Petula's hits from the 60's. What is on this CD are recently re-recorded versions of her songs. Petula's voice is a clear as ever, but the arrangements are somewhat different. When you are used to hearing the original verions of these songs, it is a bit of a disappointment."
__label__2,"a must for party clean-up: The other reviews are pretty accurate. This thing is great at cleaning random stains on carpet and upholstery. I was worried that it would leave ""clean"" spots on older carpet as some of the other reviewers mentioned, but so far it has been perfect - the carpet looks just like it did before the spill(s).If you get this, you can pick up the cleaning solution easily (and cheaply) at Walmart."
__label__2,"Been a LONG time coming: Finally they've released the second season of one of the funniest shows ever. I can't wait till season 3 comes out. The commentary is pretty good. They've recorded commentary for every episode, unlike the first season, which is a plus. It can drag at times when they decide to impersonate certain characters (the Tite brothers) but also has many gems (""Bong Boy! Are you really here?""). If you've never seen it, I would sugest starting with season one, but this is a MUST own for any fan. Special guests include: Tina Fey, Horatio Sanz, Rob Corddry, Wu-Tang Clan and David Cross."
__label__2,"A twist on the typical romance: This was my first Debra Cowan book and I wasn't disappointed! This was a romance with a twist as Susannah shows up to Whirlwind pregnant and desperate with no option but to stay. She thinks Riley has agreed to marry her via her brother's intervention, but to her shock, Riley knows nothing about it or wants anything to do with it. He can't however, turn his back on his best friend's sister. This was an interesting change from the typical romance where the women just end up pregnant-this one started that way.I'm so excited that this is a series story--I love when a good book has a few follow ups!"
__label__2,"Excellent Translation!: If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic and that the 2 versions I use most are the ""Good News"" and the ORIGINAL ""Revised Standard."" I have respect for the ""King James,"" the ""New King James,"" the ""Jerusalem,"" the ""English Standard Version,"" and the ""Holman Christian Standard."" I do NOT like the NIV or the NRSV. Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the ""Revised Standard"" and the ""New King James."" My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the ""Revised Standard."" But that said, the ""New American Standard"" is excellent."
__label__2,"everything and more: Seen the group countless times, and this does a nice job capturing the essence with a good variety of music."
__label__1,"Review: This book was very disappointing. I read the trilogy,loved the Physician and the Shaman, both very good reads. I am looking forward to the forthcoming movie. I felt the story line for Matter of Choice was weak.Main character not as dynamic as the main characters I the previous novels. Highly recommend the first and second booksin the trilogy."
__label__2,"A great informational book: Corn is Maize is a great book on corn. It not only shows how corn is grown and the many uses. It teaches the children about Indian culture and how they shared their corn with the prilgrams. A book of history, science, and social development."
__label__2,"By the Way: Great Collection of somewhat mellow/deep songs. I am a die hard RHCP fan, so I will buy their stuff no matter what. I had to listen to it several times to have it really grow on me. Are the RHCP's growing older, more mature, and perhaps slowingand/or settling down! This album has great vocals-Anthony really sings his heart out, but it is missing that edge that theRHCP's are famous for! Don't get me wrong, I do like it!Keep it up guys. Keep the tunes coming!Joan"
__label__2,Useful info: I found the book a valuable read and feel I've already benefitted from diet adjustments.
__label__1,"Not so deluxe after all: I purchased two of these units and found that the volume function on the remote does not work on either unit. I contacted XACT (which was a huge hassle) and talked to supervisor after supervisor and the only explanation they could give me to why the volume could not be adjusted from the remote was that "" it was manufactured that way""... are you kidding, i had stereo's 20 years ago that had a remote that could control volume. Other than that the unit is fine, but I just feel a state of the art ""deluxe"" boom box should be able to adjust the voulume via the remote. Why else would you waste 2 buttons on the tiny remote. It is just a pain to have to physically increase or decrease the volume manually."
__label__2,Amazing Album!: This is a great collection of Abstract Rude's unreleased gems and collabos. Highly recommended for any fan of great music!
__label__2,Tear Soup: Excellent book for anyone of any age going through the grieving process. I really liked having it available to read to my grandson when he asked me why I was crying. I recommend it whenever I can. It does not specifically mention death so it can be read by those who have experienced a loss of any kind.
__label__2,"Go For It: Hey All,I just sent this as a gift to my GF. She was very happy about this product. The only thing is, the box is made up of cardboard. Otherwise, just go for it without any second thoughts."
__label__2,"Another Great Read Suggested by ecom: First book that I've read by Napoleon Hill and definitely will not be the last, a great motivational and logical read."
__label__1,"Ending Rapidly Deteriorates: I loved the first 2/3 to 3/4 of the book, but by the end I just wanted to throw it against the wall.A novel, or set of novels, must be consistent and logical in flow for the reader, and they must play fair by the reader. It doesn't matter what those rules are so much as that they are present. Haldeman introduces new plot elements in at the end that have zero relationship to anything preceding, one of which was used to explain something that exists only as a plot device, and one thrown in for no reason whatsoever other than that he appeared to have been watching Star Trek before sitting down to type.I loved Forever War through the first 2/3 of this book, but loathed the end. Just stop reading it as soon as unexplainable things start occurring, and imagine your own ending."
__label__2,"Very cute: This toy is great. I wasn't sure at first but it went on sale, so I purchased it. The tractor is so cute and makes noises and vibrates. It comes with lots of animals and a trailer. My kids love it."
__label__2,"Farce of Industry: If there was ever a farce made of an entertainment industry, this comedy is the best example of.A funny sexy depicting of instantly occurring black deeds in a same block of flats is a mix of all genres cinematographic, where a homosexual hairdresser murdered hit-woman-nun, a mother of him.About a dozen of troops substantiate this black comedy with Buddhist monk and unprofessional Special Forces involved just to laugh at the end."

__label__2,"French text book: My French teacher swears by this book, but you do need a human teacher in a class setting, because it is all in French.There are a lot of exercises in grammar, and it is meant for people to learn to speak grammatically correct French, so in a way, i don't find it a fun book, but it does the job.

I had heard Dave some on the radio, so when I saw the book, I told my wife, jokingly, that this book was going to make us a lot of money. By early next year, after a lot of sacrifice, determination and following the principles in the book, we'll be debt free, we'll never borrow money again. We will literally begin to change our entire family tree, all thanks to a $20 hardback..."
__label__1,"Great for loud music, Awful for soft classical, acoustic: These speakers crackle when plugged into my laptop. If I unplug my laptop the crackling is reduced, but still perceptible when playing soft music. For loud music, these deliver a nice sound quality; but the crackling drives me nuts when I'm playing soft piano, acoustic, classical guitar, or really anything without enough ""wall of sound"" to drown out the crackle. I would have bought other speakers if I'd known."
__label__2,Awesome fun: Systen is now outdated but never had issues plays like it just came our of the box. Nintendo did it again. Great system and price
__label__2,"A journey through lands and cultures long ago comprimised.: It has been a few years since I read this book, so much of what I write has been pulled from my memory.I heard an NPR review of ""The Life of my Choice"" and was moved to purchase the book. I was not disappointed. Thesiger takes you by the hand as he explores ""The Dark Continent"", from his childhood introduction to Halle Selassie to his life living among the nomadic people in the deserts of Northern Africa.Adventures abound in this book. Written from the point of view of an old (and probably now dead!) British colonialist, it is a bit jaded at times. However, Thesiger truly appreciated the land and the people of Africa and found himself to prefer them to his refined contemporaries in England."
__label__1,"Um, Aphex Twin....: This album is the predictable jump to electronic texturing that has already been mastered by Aphex Twin. Any music fanatic knows that this album is not an album at all. It should be labeled as Radiohead's experimental b-sides that dont break any new ground. This is far more unoriginal than Ok, and too repetitive for Radiohead's true songwriting capabilities."
__label__2,"Luved the DVD: I saw this movie on TV years ago, and I wanted to have it on DVD since then, the edition is wonderful, I loved seeing it again, and the editional features are wonderful, great movie.

One of the couples announces that they intend to get married and when the bride-to-be tells the others that she is terminally ill, they make sure the wedding takes place that weekend. and what a wonderful wedding and beautiful island."

'Both Sides' starts off confidently enough with a couple of commercially strong 'radio play' tracks (Off The Hook being one), then dies rather quickly with uninspired make-weight fodder - struggling for musical ideas. What a shame that (again) musicians of this calibre compromise their talents for the sake of making a quick commercial buck. Other 'smooth jazz' artists seem to me to be more comfortable with the style, do it far more convincingly, and far more consistently to warrant buying this CD."
__label__2,"Shirley: Not just for kids. Excellent for someone in a wheelchair. Love this item! I do not have children in the house, so if you want it for a kid's room consider that the base, while sturdy is not weighted, so must keep pegs on each side balanced when hanging heavier items like coats, so it won't tip."
__label__2,"Absolutely hilarious & gripping: It has been a long time since I have read a book that immediately ropes you in and isn't difficult to get to know all the characters, who each are fascinating in their own way and the story line is fantastic! This is a book to take away on a holiday with you, for you won't be able to put it down for long! :)"
__label__2,Justified: This is a great series. I am enjoying watching season two right now on FX. I really enjoy the character Raylan and all of his imperfections. This is for mature audiances only though as it does have entense situations and violance. Totally worth watching it if you enjoy detective/cop type of shows.
__label__1,"One man's bread...: ...is another man's poison. Before I get flamed by rabid Tolkien fanatics, let me state that I've attempted to enjoy this book several times over the last 7 years or so. Each time, I've managed to get perhaps 1/3 of the way through before I finally give up. I mean, I enjoyed ""The Hobbit"", and, as devoted fantasy readers, it's our duty to worship L.O.T.R., right? Sorry, but this is one book of flowery prose that zaps me (and many readers, I'm betting) right into slumberland. The characters and situations are well-crafted, but his style of writing about them generates a 0 on the interest meter."
__label__2,overall a good set: cool train set although some of the wheels keep falling off and the cars are a bit cheaply made (engine is good). also if you purchase consider buying extra track...especially if you are running it around a Christmas tree!
__label__2,"Review: Great tool, didn't give it a 5 because I'm not used to the one hand only open/tighten mandrel; you got to learn that, and remember it in the event of using 2 or 3 drills in the same project, which is not unusual.Something else that I took advantage, of course, is the extremely low selling price from ecom, which shows that the distributor of it in the US is overcharging ridiculously more that what they shoud, so then, 4 stars.Dario"
__label__2,"Nice, but inferior to the one on FF7: This book is helpful, though I really miss the layout of the FF7 guide. Why did they put all the maps in the back ? I'm also one of those who like looking ahead and reading the plot, so I missed out in this book. :) Plus, this isn't a big deal, but, I was a little disappointed in the character pages. However, I got a free poster with my FF8 guide, so I won't be too picky. :)"
__label__1,"Executive guide is right.: There is not enough detail here to make this book worth the money. Don't waist your time, there are many other books here that will fill in the details, this is not one of them."
__label__1,Very tiny: The product description should have included the measurement of the item. This is very tiny than it appears in the photo.
__label__2,"A doctor's office in a book. My parenting bible!: This is a BIG book, and it never failed me. I found it comforting, reassuring, compassionate and helpful. It was exactly what this working mom needed, whether my daughter was 2 weeks old, or approaching two years. There was always an answer or suggestion, and it fit my parenting style perfectly. I worked full-time, and found the attachment parenting ideas made me feel that our time together was used to the fullest. I highly recommend this book, and if you saw my well-worn, dog-eared copy,you'd know how often and thoroughly I used it!"
__label__2,"pretty good: This does a pretty good job of getting the juice out of the orange, lemon..... the only thing it doesn't do very well is keep the pulp out."
__label__1,Disapointing: I was very disapointed in this version of Persuasion. The interesting characters were not developed. Nothing that made the book so delightful came through in this version of the movie.
__label__1,How dare Dan Wagner: Alison left Howard after reading this book because she finally realized how creepy some of his sycophantic fans are.
__label__2,"Lots of fun learning and experiencing for my 2 year old: My 2 1/2 year old enjoys playing with these fun fruits and vegetables. Here's what we received:Peach you can cut in half, you can see the pit inside.Banana you can peel three times.Orange you can peel four times and then cut into four segments.Cauliflower you can peel twice to get the greens off and then cut in half.Cabbage you can peel two outer leaves off.Ear of corn you can peel three times.Onion you can slice twice.Bean pod you can open to expose the beans.We did not receive the pineapple shown in some of the pictures. We still really like the set!My little one knew exactly what to do as soon as he saw the play knife and the fruits and vegetables. He has no trouble peeling but needs some help stabilizing the item he's cutting, I'm sure he'll get better with practice. He is mostly able to get them back together on his own. I like that he is able to recognize each item, they are realistic looking. This is a great learning toy!"
__label__2,"Excellent place to start with microcontrollers: This is a great book for learning a ""beginner's basics"" in microcollers. I give it four stars because of the misleading cover images of robots. There is nothing in the book about making a complete robot, but there are good basic microcontroller applications that could be used in a robot. In other words, there are PIC Basic programs where the reader can see real world applications while learning how to program and set up circuits."
__label__1,"Touches on the basics, but very inept overall.: As AP Environmental Science is not offered at my school, I decided to take it as an independent study course, as did two of my friends. Both of them ordered the Princeton book, and I bought this one. It was a choice I came to regret.Although this book touches on some topics, it does so in little detail and is a poor supplement to textbook reading. Also, the practice tests included are nothing like the acutal AP test. Get Princetons or The Smartypants' Guide to the AP Environmental Science Exam, both of which are infinately better."
__label__2,Sharpening Kit: It's a little work to sharpen knives; not really sure if the electric one would have done the same.
__label__2,The tweezer of tweezers: This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can't wait for my next splinter...
__label__1,"Great height, easy use, not strong enough.: The extra tall gate was perfect height for my 2 yr old who is 36"". She broke it within a months time, by banging and pulling on it. The latch could not withstand her strength. I also didn't find it secured well enough since it does not have the capacity to be bolted into the wall. At the time it cost us $70, and I was unable to contact anyone from the company for a replacement or refund. (We had thrown away the box!)"
__label__1,"This CD was an obvious failed attempt to be funny.: This CD was a failed attemp to impersonate Weird Al Yankovich. The lyrics are attempting to be funny but are old, bland, and repetitive. The lead singer has no change whatsoever in his voice. He sounds like he has a cold the entire CD. Unfortunatley, Pretty Fly for a White Guy, was completely overplayed into oblivion. I at first liked this song, sadly. I also was a fan of the Offspring before this horrible CD. I especially cant stand the unthoughtful lyrics. The videos are even worse!!! They are so far from funny. I wish that at the end of ""why dont you get a job"" the dynamite would have blown up the whiny lead singer. That about sums it up."
__label__2,"Raw, unflinching memoir of pain and redemption -: Raging Bull is an awesome retrospective. Through a childhood of abject poverty, crime and pain, La Motta harnessed his evil intentions sufficiently (for a time, at least) to win the Middleweight boxing championship. When such a title meant something.Covering his rise, fall and redemption - LaMotta's voice speaks with blatant honesty. His life has been indeed been fascinating, painful and poignant."
__label__1,Cannibal Holocaust: Worst online buying experience of my LIFE. It arrived extremely late and would not play. Whe I asked for another copy or what the return policy is I received no responce. Buyer BEWARE
__label__2,"Secrets exposed: Ms Nasser has done a wonderful job of marrying descriptions of authentic Palestinian cooking with regional history. Not shy to attribute foreign influence to ""typcial"" Palestinian dishes, she has enhanced the value of these recipes and added extra spice with her own personal nostalgias. I lived in the Gaza Strip for two years and have been in Beirut now for four and it's obvious to me that the author's understanding of Western and Eastern culture has enabled her to produce a cookbook that appeals in both domaines. Thank you, Ms Nasser, especially for the excellent sfiha tips! I have been ""after"" some of these recipes for years, but I've found that many women prefer to keep their recipes ""secret."""
__label__1,"I'm not a psychic, but this was so predictable...: The story of an affair, from the point of view of the other woman. It seemed trite to me, how everything was soooooooooo right between Eric and Breck (the mistress, all I could think of was shampoo every time I read her name). The wife came off as cold-hearted, of course. Very stereotypical affair story, nothing really surprising. The end was ridiculously shortchanged. It was the only really interesting part, and the author chopped it down to several pages. Boring, boring climax."
__label__2,Great for Costumes!: These are fantastic for spy costumes. In addition to looking awesome these glasses allow you to see who's coming up behind you. Great for surprising your friends when they try to sneak up on you or just astonding them with your uncanny ability to tell who just entered the room.
__label__2,"Very Entertaining: My wife and I read this book, and we both fell out with laughter. It is a very entertaining read from beginning to end, you won't be dissapointed."
__label__1,Over-rated: This product isn't exatly what they say it is. If you are a person who has muscles in your upper arms (which is most men) it is next to impossible to get your arms bent to use this gripper. It was easy for a woman to use but for a man NO. I believe that is why they used a woman on their video commercial.
__label__2,Works Great: Tripp Lite INTERNET550SER 550VA UPS Compact Low Profile Standby 8 outlets w/ DB9 PortWe have been using our Tripp 550SER since October 2008. It meets our expectations for a great surge and small back up power supply. It would be nice if there were an option to turn off the beep alarm when the standby power is running.This is a great unit.
__label__2,Great tool...: This book is great for anyone who is taking a writing course or any other academic endeavor that requires APA format. It's an easy guide to follow and provides concise reference for any question.
__label__1,One star for a great album: I hate to rate this album that bad as the music is really great but you can't listen to it on your mp 3 player without going through all kinds of trouble getting around the copy protection. What does the record company expect ? Make people who already bought the album download the songs again for a buck each if they want to listen to them on their portables. Not me. Boycott this album !!
__label__1,"Disappointed: My 4yr. old daughter wanted this toy more than anyother for christmas. Once she got it and we both played with it, she left it after 15 minutes and it now sits in the corner.The head falls off all the time, there is no place to put the extra pieces of the toy, and the molds are a pain to use.It would be better to buy play-doh alone instead of a ""kit""."
__label__1,"Minority Report is Majority Boring: Based on a book, this thrill-a-hour movie didn't make any sense. Unresolved philosophical musings abound. Like, if the alien lady saw the future, then how did it not happen? Was she a liar? And who stole his kid? One of those three water aliens? I liked tihs movie less than AI."
__label__2,"Johnny Mathis Live review: There are so many great tracks on this CD, but if only for ""A Certain Smile"", you should buy it...this track alone is worth it."
__label__2,"Good Book for the Technical Writer: If you are a technical writer, or want to become one, this book is a very helpful reference and guide. Very useful sections on writing instructions, short reports, and long reports. This book is one of several similar books that should be used by the professional, or by someone learning technical writing."
__label__2,"Two Good Songs....: Christina Aguilera has an great, strong voice.. She has an amazing talent that really shows.. even when she performs live.. Her voice is never weak.. I like her song ""I Turn To You"" because her voice sounds very beautiful.. and I really like the song.. I can listen to it again and again and I wouldn't get sick of it!.. And I also like ""What A Girl Wants""... my friends looooved that song.. and I liked the sound of it a lot... She may seem like a teenybopper style... But she really does have a lot of talent.. I even think she'll be around for a long time because her voice is very unique..."
__label__2,"Incredible taste, poor description: I have been purchasing this product for about a year after first trying it on a trip to Memphis. The taste is nothing like a dill pickle, and the picture above shows pickle chips, not a relish (which this is). It is like a very good sweet relish with a great kick! Not at all like a hot sauce, but will gently warm your tongue. Wonderful used in anything where you would normally use sweet relish. Really worth a try! A hot dog will never taste the same again!"
__label__2,"Happy to find this !!!: Our grand-daughter wanted this for her birthday. Being so soon after Christmas, all the local stores were out of stock....Luckily, I located this on ecom. Needless to say...She was thrilled and proceeded to exam everyone ....Thanks ecom for coming through again!!!"
__label__1,"Never let facts get in the way of a good story: What a laughable book. Despite having been debunked before the 1970s even ENDED, people persist on saying this book is based on true events. Well, to a point it is. There was a mass murder in the house on Ocean Avenue in 1974, and a family by the name of Lutz did move into the house in December of 1975 and then leave after 28 days but that's about the extent of the truth. Had this book told of the strange ""events"" that the Lutz's allegedly encountered in an exciting manner, it would have been more enjoyable. As it is, what we're stuck with is a book that's surprisingly dull for long stretches and lacks the real punch that a ghost story could have; this failing also infected the sluggish 1979 film version. The dialogue is poorly written and the book still has typos from the original printing. Read it for the historical perspective but don't expect an especially great read."
__label__2,FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS: WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ME AND MY SISTERS WOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE. UNTIL I SAW THIS SIGHT I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHOEVER KNEW ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I AM SOOOO.. GLAD I FINALLY FOUND IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAV MOVIES. SHARON TATE WAS FAB ON THIS MOVIE. I LOVED THE PART WHEN EVERYONE COMES OUT OF THE GRAVES FOR THE BALL. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS MOVIE. IF YOU LOVED OLD TIME MOVIES YOU'LL LOVE THIS. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
__label__1,"Disappointing: This really has been one of the most disappointing things I've purchased through ecom. Major cons ::(1)Shaving time is too much(2)Shaves from the root(bad when someone wants to leave a little stubble). Doesn't have any level setting for leaving a bit stubble.(3)Even after spending so much time, doesn't give a clean shave..leave a few hair here n there.I bought this shaver with high expectations, but honestly I've been disappointed by the results. Not value for money."
__label__2,"Perfect Muscle Clamps.: They are constructed of hard plastic with rubber non-slip pad inside the collar. The clamps tighten and loosen with a quick 1/4 turn of the clamp lever.These clamps are perfect. Easy on easy off. I have bought two pairs, one to keep on my bench and the others on my curl bar.I was doing bench and had 110lbs (265 total lbs.) on each side with these clamps on. I had to dump and the clamps held the 110lbs. They kept my weights from falling off and that would have been a big mess and loud for living on a top floor apt.Thanks ecom."
__label__2,"Husband Loves It: DH loves his new shaver! Its easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn't irritate his face. Finally after years of razor burn and ingrown hairs...this little shaver is heaven sent. DH has to shave every day for work and this delivers a clean, smooth shave every time...well worth the money!"
__label__1,"Why do I rate such great songs so low?: I've always been a Scorpions fan, even from the 70's. I love their music, and this album does contain their greatest hits. If I had this in the CD player, I would never hit the skip. Then why do I only give it one star? Because in the last few years, I've only seen one album with ""new"" material, and it was the same songs with an orchestra playing with them. In other words, if you're new to the Scorpions, this is a great one to get; if you're familiar with them, then you've had all of these, minus the last two songs, since 1993. Come on guys - get some new material or just retire; we've already gotten too many compilation albums!"
__label__2,"Great Mug: Cover fits good so it won't leak. Only thing about it, can warm up the fluid in the Microwave and can't use it on a cup warmer due to the rubber bottom. For traveling, its great."
__label__2,"It is NOT wide screen: The movie is a 5. The fact that it's advertised as Wide Screen yet isn't is why I give this a 4. Mysterious Island is one of my favorite movies, but I've never seen it in wide screen. (I was grounded as a kid when it was at the movies ...) Anyway, I was excited to finally be able to see Mysterious Island in Wide Screen. It's advertised that way, states it's wide screen on the package, but trust me -- it isn't."
__label__1,"Don't buy it!!!!!: Track ten is defective. Don't buy it. I've tried ecom, iTunes, and Rhapsody and all use the same defective mastering. It skips, there's holes in it and what sounds like the digital version of bad splices. It is unlistenable. Gorgeous song, ruined."
__label__2,"great for any horse lover: if you are a horse lover watch this movie, a must it asked you how far would you go for the thing that you honor the most,"
__label__2,"Rediscovered bliss: Not long ago, I rediscovered this classic album. Jorma is, in my opinion, one of the finest acoustic guitarists. Some tracks, like ""I Am the Light of this World"" and ""I'll Be Alright"" are both spirited and spiritual. It's a true joy in this fast-paced world to ease back into Quah."
__label__1,"Don't waste your time: Don't let these good reviews fool you, this book plain sux. The dialogue is moronic, the characters are totally inconsistent, and the plot is so disjointed at times I had to wonder if this was a collection of short stories. This book tries so hard to be hip and edgy, but fails in a very annoying way. If you like the Alice-in-wonderland vurt world theme then I recommend you pick up The Diamond Age by Neil Stephenson."
__label__2,Does what it is supposed to do. Great price on ecom.: Product worked as it should.Cheaper from ecom and is exactly the same thing as the Corvette branded one GM sells.Nice item to have if you have a car that is stored for the winter or otherwise not driven very often. Cars with proximity FOBs and lots of on board electronics don't like sitting around without charging for more than a couple weeks.
__label__2,"My Kids Love It!: Ed Emberly books are a great way to help kids break down the drawing process. At first I was concerned following the steps took away some of the creativity of drawing, but that has not proven to be the case. My five year old son absolutely loves it. He went from refusing to draw because he couldn't get the pictures the way he wanted them to sitting down daily with his Ed Emberly books. He gets a huge sense of accomplishment from being able to draw the characters. This book is a bit more advanced than the ""Animals"" version, so you might want to consider starting with an easier book, but the kids love the zany creatures you can draw in this one. My son thanked Ed Emberly for helping him learn to draw before he went to sleep the other night."
__label__1,"Useless?: This gaming aid might not be for everybody. If you need descriptions of the mentioned items, you'll have to look elsewhere. My copy is gathering dust on the shelf at the moment and I'm afraid it'll stay there for some time."
__label__2,"Most dog-eared cookbook in my gluten-free collection!: My non-celiac family literally inhaled the rolls last night at dinner (I baked them in mini-muffin tins to create tiny ""pop-overs""). They were light, moist, and tasty.This book provides a wonderful alternative to grainy rice flour recipes. I've had great success with the biscuits and breads. The trick is to use very fresh ingredients. I use Clabber girl ""not genetically modified"" corn starch. The one time I used corn starch that'd been in the cupboard for a year, the biscuits were flat and hard.This is a great resource for those of us with non-celiac families who want to make gluten-free foods that everyone likes to eat (who has time to cook two dinners?!)."
__label__2,This camera is awesome!: This completes my 515. No software to download. You just plug it in and it automatically adds the software to the Palm. The pictures are very sharp and presentable when they are uploaded to your pc.
__label__1,"Masters of Horrible TV: Time to take out the garbage! This is some of the worst TV ever masquerading as entertainment. The only scares in this series is how so many with so little talent were given the opportunity to make a series bereft of direction and story telling, not to mention chills and thrills. This series is for the brain dead written and directed by some of the most talentless bunch of writers and directors Hollywood could dig out from under a rock. Ed Wood looks like David Lean compared with this treacle. The set does make for cool drink coasters or mini Frisbees."
__label__2,"Really, really good.: This book moved me. That's all I can say. Great elegy for the 60s. Far superior to STP, bleh."
__label__1,"waste of time and money: the battery doesn't last through a whole movie. pretty much have to use the car adaptor, works better that way. Even after using the ac adaptor it still doesn't play the movie without skipping (disc are clean). I wouldn't recommend this product."
__label__1,"Unnecessary: I'm sorry, but this album is not needed. I love the Velvets as much as anybody, but this album pales in comparison to any of the original live albums. I want my VU albums to be groundbreaking! This is nowhere near that. Just your usual rock and roll. The superb VU atmosphere and sound is not present here. Who cares about the sound quality, if the music is not as good as it was? Go for the old stuff instead."
__label__1,Rev SUCKS: That conis whack.Just Moving around the controller will affect the games movements. I aint playing Socom just moving the controller and pressing to shoot. what happens when you turn around?Huh? did nintendo think of that? Im still buying 360 and PS3. Oh by the way did you see MGS4? Its cool.
__label__2,the finale gives me goosebumps: I read that finale over and over. The apparatchiki put down their briefcases and build barricades. I was there at EDSA in Manila when the kids and the nuns stopped the tanks with flowers and rosaries. Yet only when I read the MCS description do I get the full impact of People Power as a transformation and triumph of the human spirit.
__label__1,The Price is Wrong!: $52.00 for a Kindle version of this book is just WRONG. There is no paper. There is no stocking fee. There is no handling. I will not pay $52.00 for someones opinion of a book and if you do not have a Kindle and are paying over $100.00 you are out of your mind!
__label__2,"goooooood product!!: This product does what it's supposed to, for sure. I was using it for AC, then within two months I figured out my overheating problem and flipped the switch to operate a ceramic heater. WORKS GREAT!! Worth every penny!"
__label__2,SMASHING: I absolutely luv No Authority expecilly Danny! I reasonitly got to see them in concert! They were smashing! I bought their CD and luved every song on it! My best pal Amanda is good friends with their manager and she said that next time i see her she will give me his number! Tootles
__label__2,"A BEST SELLER: This book was so emotional and personal in my eyes. Asha Bandele is one of many great african american authors of this century. Reading this book is exactly what one who has never been through her situation needs to read because it lets all of us know how prison life really and truly is to a certain stand point. I TRULY LOVED THIS BOOK!!! Not everyone believes in the power of love but after reading this book it just might make a true believer in someone. It takes a very strong woman to take the path less traveled and in this case it's becoming or being the wife of a prisoner. This books gets down to the nitty gritty about a lot of things that go on in the life of an inmate and the loved ones that stand by the inmate that have to suffer also. For those who are curious about how it is or how it may be, I would 100% recommend this book."
__label__1,Boring: 'Dust in the wind' is an excellent song. Everything else on this album is too abstract or too boring.The only people who'd appreciate this album are die hard Kansas fans or people who like progressive rock from the 70's.I bought the album for 'Dust in the wind' thinking they may have other catchy tracks. I should've looked around for a compilation featuring that track instead.
__label__1,"1202F-8 Made in China: I received my new Starrett 1202 and to my suprise the box was labeled ""Made in China."" I called Starrett because I was not sure if this was a knock off or what. They told me this tool is made in China and they have no comperable U.S. made product."
__label__1,"Half way works...: The headblade worked well on HALF of my head. I have to admit that this was one of the smoothest and closest shaves that I've ever had.When I needed to transition to the back of my head... well, that's where the problems began.The ""car"" feels a little unbalances, so as I rolled over to the back of my head the wheels lifted off my head carving a HUGE painful divot into the top of my head.This happened not once, but twice.Good concept... just doesn't work well for me."
__label__2,"MASTERFUL EFFORT: Anyone worried about horns, strings,soulful melodies and lyrics should stick to his usual musical diet of charlatans posing as artists. Thank you Allison for the growth exhibited on this, yourjunior effort. I can only imagine how much fun your senior yearwill be!"
__label__1,"Good ideas at a very basic level: Well, I rate this book pretty low, even though I like what it says. But then, it's been said so often already in so many places before.If you never thought about money and your own emotional and mental relationship to money, this book is a good read. But then, I would suggest you read David Boyle's ""The Little Money Book"", which actually gives facts and history to that thing that makes the world go round. And you will be surprised reading it."
__label__1,Wish i could give a good review of 1.5: First and formost the item sent was not version 1.5 but 1.0 on cd.Not a problem go on line and download the latest version of 1.58.Then i find out that the program will not work with windows 7.So far i have not been able to use this program because i don't have windows xp.So please be advised that if you need or want to use this program make sure to have xp.Maybe one day the program will be updated to the 21st century and windows 7.Thanks
__label__1,"so bad i could cry: Larry Clark has a fixation with teens having sex on screen. It was a bit shocking on Kids and Bully, but here it just looks like soft core porn. The reason why: this movie has no plot. It is extremely absurd. Cave teens discover a city in ruins inhabited by two mutants who want to turn them into mutants as well. but in the process some kids die of horrible gory deaths...having a lot of sex, drugs and booze in the way.Kids was a masterpiece, Bully was also one of the best movies of 2001. They were pretty raw but they had interesting topics. Teenage Caveman is really preposterous.Instead of developping his skills as a filmaker after Bully, Clark has taken a huge step back with Teenage Caveman."
__label__1,Item is rough from casting: You'll have to finish this material extensively as it comes rough from casting.I would have expected a more finished material.I would not purchase it again.
__label__1,"never came: the item never came, unfortunately, so I am not able to comment on its quality. It was supposed to be shipped from China."
__label__2,"Easy to use and lots of online help: Having used flowcharting programs for business modeling, beginning about the time Visio was introduced, I find Visio the easiest to use of all. User groups and Visio forums have tutorials and free downloads. Any Visio 2000 version qualifies for the Visio 2007 upgrade price for both standard and professional versions."
__label__1,"Outrageous: If I buy a very expensive print edition of a book, I am thinking of a $150 specialized book on Venice, why can't I have a Kindle copy too? Instead I have to choose. Kindle copy is $120.Information and Communication in Venice: Rethinking Early Modern PoliticsSo both would be $270. Outrageous!As a fan of Venitian history I would like to read a hard copy at home but have it with me when I travel. But $270? You have to be kidding!"
__label__1,"Not very good: I have to agree with the ""dud"" comment, because I got a copy of this and thought the stories were either dull or of amateur quality. This can't really be what women are thinking, at least not the women I know who are vibrant and wildly sexy."
__label__2,"Hoping for a Revised Edition: The authors' story of how Polaris created Victory Motorcycles is truly an inspirational new product development journey. A visionary business plan, coupled with a highly motivated, passionate, and skilled team gave us an outstanding American motorcycle alternative. I hope the authors have an updated edition planned. Victory has come a long way since the first book was released. It would be great to read about Victory's progress in recent years."
__label__1,"Not for engineers: Maybe it's a good book for the Nascar and other North American race car fans to know how those cars are tunned, but it is not really a Chasss Engineering reference book."
__label__2,"If you think your jewelry is clean, YOU'RE WRONG!: I have used every jewelry cleaning apparatus known besides steam. There is absoutely no comparison. This steam cleaner is so much better than any ultrasonic cleaner out there! I cleaned multiple pieces with an ultrasonic cleaner before using this steam cleaner. The difference was astonishing, to say the least. I was amazed when comparing a piece that I had just cleaned with one of the most expensive ultrasonic cleaners (diamond earings)to the steamed cleaned piece. You will not be dissapointed. This product is worth every penny if you want your jewelery to look like it shoud.This machine takes a few minutes to heat up, but it is worth the wait. I would definately recommend this product if you want your jewelery to look its best!"
__label__2,"Great: This book was fun to read and helpful to my understanding of criminal law. It adopts a simple and effective writing style, and uses a lot of examples to help highlight nuances in confusing concepts (such as legal impossibility versus factual impossibility in highly attempts). I only wish I had started reading it earlier.Highly recommended."

__label__1,"Would be nice if it stayed bright: My first issue with this flashlight is that after installing batteries, it would not turn on. I checked to make sure the batteries were in correctly which they were and after a few shakes and taps it lit up. Seemed nice at first, very bright and a nice cone of light. Then it started to dim and it appeard half the LED's were not working. Another tap and they lit back up but then continued to dim or flicker. Seems like pretty poor quality to me as some other reviewers have the same issues. I would not recommend this flashlight."
__label__2,"Excellent training Monitor: I have the Forerunner 305 and I love it. It monitors my heart rate, my pace, my route, my distance, elevation, and my lap and total time. When I download the information, I get a plot of up to 4 variables vs time or vs distance. The GPS location seems to be accurate to about 5-10 feet horixontally and 15-20 feet vertically. I am amazed. I run in Santa Fe, a high desert with no tall buildings. It took awhile to figure out all of the options and I still have not used them all. You can program 3 screens with 2-4 readouts on each. I display 4 values on each screen. One screen for instantaneous lap values of time, distance, pace and heart rate. One screen for last lap total time and distance and average values of pace and heart rate, and one screen for total workout values of the same parameters."
__label__1,"One of the Most Frustrating Games I've Ever Played: I too am a big fan of the Sims franchise, and had a blast playing the (highly addictive) Sims 2 for the DS. But I am ready to throw Castaway into the sea.While a cool concept and fun to get started on, it becomes very frustrating very quickly. I spend all my time now hunting one particular kind of fish so I can progress through the game. It's been three days and I still have not caught the stupid fish.I guess the game is still too new to have a helpful walkthrough online, but from what I've read in the forums there are a lot of people as frustrated as I am at other points in the game which makes me not very anxious to move forward anyway. There is something to be said for a challenge--but not to the point that it makes you become so frustrated you want to put down the game!"
__label__1,"Another Lumen Gentium groupie....yawn...: Non-Serviam oddities like Kaiser are not interested in what the documents of Vatican II actually say, they're only interested in what the ""Spirit of Vatican II""(TM) intends, which, conveniently, coincides with what they already think.What sort of objectivity can one expect from this book? Turn to page 68. The ""Jesuit turned journaist"" makes no effort to hide his disgust for the new pope: At one hyperbolic point, he writes that the then-cardinal has ""wolverine rings under his eyes."" I suppose Kaiser's nasty remarks about having dark circles around one's eyes,(due to age, infirmity, allergies etc) is supposed to be the best argument for his Jesuit/Marxist vision of real Catholicism."

__label__1,"Not a safe stroller: This is a good-looking stroller. But to me, strollers should first and foremost be safe and sturdy. This stroller, however, has some design features that put its safety in question.It is narrower than most other strollers, which could be a plus for some folks who need to navigate tight spaces.But I have a strong caution: I gave this stroller a thorough trial in the store with my child, and found that every time we turned a corner, a wheel would raise off the ground. The stroller does not have a sturdy wheelbase and frankly scared me. The problem is with the design of the stroller. I would never buy this stroller for my child, and if you are planning on buying or using it, do so knowing it is poorly designed and could tip over."

__label__2,"Love this curry!: My husband and I have been asking our New York friends for years to bring us boxes of S&B Medium Hot curry when they visit because we can't find it in Richmond. So glad to know we can get it on line. We love this curry, so easy to make. I usually add carrots and onions along with the chicken, and melt the blocks of curry paste in water in the microwave so it blends better. It's also excellent in a pie, just make the receipe and put it in a baked pie crust, cover it with another pie crust and stick it in the oven for a little while."

__label__1,"Ridiculous!: I am kicking myself for not reading reviews before buying this CD. I am fairly fluent in Spanish and want my kids to learn. I listened to the first couple songs on this CD and I couldn't help thinking that this could be a Saturday Night Live skit. The way this woman tries to stuff sloppy Spanish tranlations of English-language children's songs into the same rhythm of the English original is nothing short of comical and totally unhelpful to my kids. The phrases are rushed and garbled. I can barely pick out the Spanish words myself! My I recommend instead the brilliant CD called ""El Doble de Amigos"" by Sol y Canto. And, after you see how much better that one is, please help me find Sol y Canto and convince them to produce a follow-up children's album!"

He discusses everything about training on your own (supplementary to dojo training, not in place of it), including sections such as how to keep motivated and training outdoors. His instructions/teachings are clear and concise. I strongly recommend this book, and all others by Mr. Christensen, for that matter."

__label__2,"Classic Looking: When I asked my dad what he wanted for his birthday, he said he wanted a watch that had clean lines and was ""classic"" looking. After browsing in many stores and online, I kept coming back to this Bulova. It is sleek, yet substantial. It is a good size, not overly large as some men's watches can be. My dad's reaction to the watch was great. He loved it and said it was the best gift he's ever received. He has since mentioned that he wears it nearly daily and that it goes well with his business attire and casual wear. Overall, I think this Bulova was a great choice and with the company's reputation, I know my dad will have this watch for a very long time."

This book is a horrendous photocopy of an illegible 19th century copy of Tennyson's Works. Less than half of the volume's pages can be read.

__label__2,"Fantastique!: There have been many comparisons between this book and the work of Patricia Cornwell. There are similarities, but Tempe Brennan has much more heart and most importantly humor than Kay Scarpetta has ever had. I say there's more than enough room for female authors writing strong, intelligent and emotionally complex female characters. The French touches were wonderful. I never realized how much French I remembered from high school and college. I pray that the world will hear more from Kathy Reichs!"
__label__2,"Beautifully Done: This is a great CD. Leslie Feist did not make the mistake of so many artist, who use their sophomore album to experiment, or go in a different direction in order to show their range. She sticks to what works for her, while growing at the same time. The songs are sexy and sophisticated but unpretentious. Her voice is as sensual as ever. She sounds a little more polished and commercial on this album, but retains her own unique style. My favorites are: ""1234"", ""Brandy Alexander"", ""So Sorry"", ""I Feel it All"".Jennifer K.

We ordered 6 cases on in early Feb. 4 cases arrived in 3 weeks -- but we're still waiting on the other 2! That's 9 weeks folks! I could have grown the soybeans and canned the stuff myself in 9 weeks. We made the mistake of trying to buy other 6 cases in early March -- and ecom is now estimating delivery in JUNE! That's 12 weeks!!!It's a crime ecom still sells this product to unsuspecting customers.
__label__1,"Think Again: Loved the product when I got it because of ease of use. I broke both my hands several times, so I don't have much strength in them. I bought this product 8/08, it broke 10/08. I use cracked pepper in everything, the one ""ear"" is not made for continuous heavy use, it snapped. I was not rough with it as I don't have the strengthin my hands, but it did get heavy use. If you are a light user I would highly recommend this. If your a heavy user, forget it."
__label__1,"Won't last even a season: This well-tailored cover fits perfectly and looks very nice -- for the first couple of months. Our grill is in a corner, against the wall on the north side of our home, so the cover doesn't even get direct sunlight until late afternoon. Still, after just a couple of months, the color started fading and the fabric became very fragile. A moderate wind is all it took to shred the cover. Other covers may cost more, and not fit as well, but they'll last longer. Don't waste your money on this one."

Very Disappointing as it would made perfectly easy to peel boiled eggs!!

My only complaint is that we have to keep it a little loose so she can slide it on and off her wrist, otherwise we have to under the whole watch each time. It would be nice if there was a real clasp that could open and close easily."

__label__1,"selling pancakes disguised as ""anarchic"": The editors are not consistent with being ""extreme"". This is a commercial lie. I was aware that this is just a catalogue of books, but they don't even include the publishing dates for each of the books in the bibliographies, trying to make them look current, recent editions. Bad , unprofessional, dishonest selling technique. Then, for instance, they consider Rigoberta Menchu's autobiography as ""extreme information""???? Why? Because she's a Guatemalan indian? Come on! In which world does the editor live? In a whitie burgeoise American suburban one? Then how can he edit a ""sourcebook of extreme information""?? He just wants to sell, and his anarchy is sweetened and cheap, lazy compilation of back covers reviews. Not worth the 23 dollars I paid for it."

The rest can be deleted. Just list the bloody amps and voltage! I know what the batteries are used for, I am not a hick!"
__label__2,"Comfort food and reading...: The recipes in ""The Country Gourmet"" spin a tale of comfort as well as good eats. The remembrances of the author's mama and her love of food and life does more than feed the reader's soul, it gives the reader hope that there is truly more to life than getting out of bed each day; there are wonderful dishes to prepare and delicious people to get to know and break bread together with. TWO THUMBS way up for this amazingly inspiring cookbook/biography chronicling a daughter's love for her mother and her mother's cooking."
__label__1,"Great until it broke: I bought this player a little over a year ago, mainly for the ability to upgrade the firmware to region-free. Played everything I put in it until a few days ago, when it started having intermittent problems- graphics were staticy and blocky, sound would just buzz and it wouldn't eject discs until I shut it down and restarted it. That lasted for two days before the problem became permanent. Now it's a doorstop. The Apex web site appears to be down right now, but based on the other reviews here I doubt there's much point in contacting them."
__label__2,"Beautiful, somber all female comp: Mimi Parker (Low)makes her debut solo effort as does Rebecca Gates (Spinanes) on this compelling follow up to Shanti Project Collection. All the tracks are new or rare and quite satisfying. I'm especially fond of Mimi Parker and Julie Doiron's (Eric's Trip) tunes. The photographs and booklet design is beautiful and overall the cd is well worth adding to your collection."
__label__2,"Not the strongest fan, but gets the job done.: I wasn't sure if I should upgrade and spend $80 on a nice window fan, so I decided to risk it and go for something a little more low budget. This isn't the strongest fan in the world, but it does suck enough air in from outside to cool my bedroom down. Not super noisy or difficult to use. For the price, I'm pretty happy with my purchase."
__label__2,"Holy Mother . . . !!: Holy Mother of all that there is! Who would have thought that yoga could be so strenuous! If you're looking for a good, no impact workout, look no further. Each segment is just long enough to work your muscles, but short enough to not kill you! The commentary is SO soothing, you almost forget that your muscles are screaming at you to STOP THE INSANITY!

__label__1,"NOT - Midnight in the Graden of Good and Evil: The premise of the book is good. But - Berendt fails to pull off the the connecting of rich characters around a central theme he did so successfully with Midnight. The book lacks continuity and lacks a beginning a middle and an end. One gets the impression that he took the template of Midnight and trys to fit Angels within the same format. He does not pull it off. The book is not quite a travel log, it's not quite a mystery and it fails to demonstrate investigative prowess. I was suspect of his ability to get the provincial Venitians to bare their souls to him. The book ends with a thud. If you start it and think it is worth sticking with against the hope that he pulls it all together with a climactic ending, you'll be disapponted ."

__label__1,"an entertaining one-time-only read, or a great way to kill time in an airport: Chuck Klosterman has the kind of literary journalism style that is usualy only found on self-indulgant blogs or pop-culture magazines that people forget about once they reach drinking age. While his writing style will keep the reader interested, it seems he doesn't have the ability to write about anything without writing about himself first.Reading the back cover, one would think that this book was about death, drugs, and rock n roll, however Chuck only mentions those things in between rambling about all the women he's loved before and why he can't let go of any of them. Future ex-girlfriends: beware. Chuck needs to let go and grow a pair.If you're looking for a good rock 'n roll experience, go elsewhere. If you're looking for another reason to hate rock journalism, check this book out. If you happen to run into Chuck Klosterman on the street, punch him in the face for me. I'm sure he'll write about it."

I went through the book in just a few days, so it kept my attention, and as I said, entertained me, as a work of fiction should.I recommend this book for anybody looking for pure entertainment. Take the message with a grain of salt, but enjoy the laughs and humour. Worth the read."
__label__2,"Study Guide: I purchased this book to study for the TEXES Business Education Content exam since there is not a study guide for that test. I have not received my scores, yet, but I feel that it helped me tremendously. The content in the study guide seemed more difficult than the test, so I felt well prepared. Definitely worth the price, especially for the 100-question practice test included!"

Zsolt grabs the reader and together they pell mell down mountainsides, slip into the chilling warmth of therapy pool and ride in a wheelchair massaging the most from life's offerings. This book expands the heart. It gives a new and welcoming perspective to those we called handicapped, disabled or different. Zsolt drew his last breath just as his beloved Handel's Hallaluah Chorus began to play on December 24, 2005. His disease claimed his body but not his life. You get a rare delectible taste of life from Living, Loving and Other Heresies and you crave for more."

One of my sons is enamored with anything Cookie and is glued to the television when I play the dvd for him.

The songs on the video are the ones that originally aired in the 70's and 80's and aren't dated at all. In between the clips is Cookie baking cookies--this segment flows well between the songs. All in all you can't miss with this one. This dvd, along with a Cookie Monster from Build-a-bear is a great gift idea!"

I'm a third of the way through the book and no one has died yet and nothing's been stolen--there's no mystery yet! I too have a Mennonite heritage and my relatives would kick her right out of Hernia for her blase' attitude about her religion...

I've been an Eve 6 fan since their self titled, (which I absolutely adore) all the way up through... they haven't disappointed me yet. Catchy lyrics and slick guitar riffs... I'm hooked. My personal faves are ""Bring The Night On"", ""Think Twice"", ""Good Lives"" and ""Hokis""... and I could do without ""Hey Montana."" **shudders** Ewww. But, hey, nobody's perfect. Minus that one song, the rest rock out. Download ""Bring The Night On"" and ""Think Twice"" if you haven't yet, then go out and buy the CD. It rocks."
__label__1,"Intellectually lazy childish nonsense: If you care for wit and original humour, enter not ye here! The roasters must have been sharing notes before they hit the stage because all of the jokes centred around homosexuality, bodily functions and other schoolyard themes. Extremely crude material elicited visible winces from the audience. Is America entering the final decadent slope that precipitated Rome's decline? It appears that cable TV (ie comedy channel) has truly become no-holds-barred and is running roughshod over any semblance of class. Is mainstream society getting dumber, where they cannot comprehend intellectual wit anymore, or just cruder? I leave that to you reader to ponder..."
__label__1,"Bought it, Now I have to Replace all Tub plumbing.: I bought the Drain key after trying to replace the drain. It sounded easy. Place key into tub and keep turning until nut stops. The nut never did stop but the PVC under the tub broke first. Now i am cutting drywall, and plywood out, and replaceing the PVC piping underneath the tub. Thanks Drain Key. I am getting a new tub drain, and piping, and drywall, and plywood all thanks to your tool."
__label__1,Skip This Item: I put this item on my registry thinking it would be great........however the suction bulb cracked after 2 weeks (luckily the hospital gives you one) The thermometer was not accurate (unless my baby really had a tempertature of 78) Any medication you will give you baby has it's own dropper with it!! In fact the only item I use is the nail clippers!!! This is the 4th product from Safety 1st that I no longer use after two months. I am not impressed!!!!!

__label__2,"Very Good: I am very pleased with headset.1. Light weight2. Very Comfortable. Ear pad is well paded and it swivels. Head loop piece is adjustable and comfortable.3. Cord appears to be fairly robust.4. Fidelity is great.The only negative is, with phone set at lowest volume, headset is slightly on the loud side (there is no volume control on headset)"

IT'S AMAZING, WITH ALL THE SHOOTING AND VIOLENCE, BLOOD AND GORE, MY GOD, THIS IS A MUST-BUY VIDEO GAME.

__label__1,"A rich white man's manual to living the proper Republican life.: It is easy for the mother to stay at home and raise the children when there is half a million dollars in the checking account. This book is surely a good read for the families that can afford to have two homes and a housekeeper. For the majority of American families, the Senator's book is an utter waste of time. More like a work of fiction, if you ask me."
__label__1,"Too different from the book: The acting is stilted, the quality poor, and the script strays too far from the actual book. Since I bought a used VHS, I didn't lose out on all that much, but it most definitely isn't worth the full price for a new video. I showed it to my class of seniors and they found one discrepancy after another. It's a shame they don't remake the movie. It could be a powerful voice, but was quite muted in this version."
__label__1,"A few laughs, but soon repetitive and boring: This sounded like it'd be fun. It's funny for a little while, but it's not a fun game. We only played for a few days, and now it's sitting on the shelf. You might want to get it if it's in the bargain bin (<$5) but otherwise, save your money."

__label__1,"Disappointing and Frustrating toy: This piano is designed so that the baby lies on their back and kicks at it to make noise... which means the baby cannot see the toy at all. My baby searches for the source of the sound and because she cannot see the toy she does not really understand what is going on. When she sees the toy, she naturally wants to move her body to look at it directly, but when she moves her body around to see the piano she can no longer play it. What frustration!"
__label__2,"Shouldn't be a necessary option, but it works great: I bought a USB WiFi Adaptor because the internal WiFi in my MacBook went south. The only problem is that the USB ports on the MacBook are so close together, with the widish WiFi profile, plugging it in blocked the other USB port. I could use a cable extender, but that was clumsy when moving the MacBook around, so I bought this articulated adaptor. Works great! Good price! Good delivery. Problem Solved."
__label__1,"Y'all know I love Mary: but if you are considering this cd...skip it. The radio played the mess out of what could have been one of the few interesting songs on the cd (I Can Love You). This cd is sooo commercial. It feels like air. None of the bangin' beats characteristic of the Queen of Hip Hop Soul are present. Searching has a cute break beat thing happening. Other than that I really felt like getting my money back. I recommend What's the 411, My Life or Mary."
__label__1,"Nice size, decent price, impossible to configure: I consider myself extremely capable on computers, and have installed many harddrives, yet I find this drive and the included MaxBlast software the most difficult thing I have ever encountered. I had a problem installing Windows 98 and NT numerous times, and found the software extremely hard to work with, since it is required to utilize all 15 gig, or else I would have used FDISK and FORMAT. Anyway, only buy this if you are extremely confident and have the number of your favorite Computer Technician handy."
__label__2,"Awesome anime series: Banner of the Stars is the sequel to one of the best anime series, Crest of the Stars. This is a great dvd and leaves anyone who watches it wanting more. It perfectly combines both a close friendship and political conflict in a vast universe to create a series that is near perfect. It hints love between Jinto and Lafiel two of the star of this dvd. It makes you feel that thier friendship and possible love between each other is accomplished a important because of their past conflicts and signifacant ethnic differences. Before buying this dvd you must watch the first series, Crest of the Stars( which is also a must buy ), so that you will now whats going on. This is a must buy for anyone who loves a good story, anime fan or not."
__label__1,"A dull little book: I'm sorry I got this. If you want dull decorating, buy this book. I'd say that it's aimed at people like my mother, but even she is cooler than this. It's full of dull, traditional, expected, ""by the book"" decorating. There's nothing fresh or new about this. If you want ordinary, traditional, old style, you don't need a book to create it. If you want a fresh sparkle or idea, find a better book than this one. Maybe people with no style of their own will find this appealing. I can't imagine why."
__label__2,great: I ordered this for college and it was cheap and in good condition and it came on time. I like it when you get what you order.
__label__2,Better than expected.: A GREAT READ. I had a hard time putting it down. My only complaint is that it ended rather abruptly.
__label__2,Great watch: Gave this gift to my husband on his birthday. He loved it! He said It's a great everyday watch. It's very light compared to his breitling. Well recommended for chronograph automatic movement lovers.
__label__1,"Simply Awful: I would like you to know that I'm not an easy quitter. However I couldn't keep this thing in my apartment more than one day. Next day it was in its way back to ecom. I've read the instructions word by word. Tried every possibility including what's mentioned in other reviews. There was no way to stop the constant background hissing. When I turned my head left or right, it didn't hesitate to let me know loudly. I found one way , not in the instructions,to stop the hissing is to keep my head two feet away from the base. Yes I have two cordless phones. I disconnected them both with no avail. I borrowed my friend's ""Acoustic Research"" wireless headphones and soon realized the problem was not with my head, it was Sony's all along."
__label__2,"The Martha Stewart of Junk...: Anyone who can make REAL junk look this good is a friend of mine! As a casual collector of things old with a special place for kitchen collectibles, I found this book fascinating not only for its content - such a wide variety of items - but also for the excellent photography, creative displays, and down-home narrative style. While you won't find this useful as a pricing guide, you can still get a feel for values of some everyday items you might find. This was my second book by Mary Randolph Carter and they have become my ""coffee table"" books. (I now have all 3 of her Junk books.)"
__label__2,"Timothy is Beyond Life and Ahead of his time: This is a near perfect CD. The musical selections seem to put the soul at ease as Timothy Leary would want it. The Moody Blues contribute several tracks to this CD such as Legend of a Mind. Allen Ginsburg also appears on Track 10. This CD is a must have for anyone who respects Timothy Leary. This CD includes Trip- Hop, and Indian influences and is a must buy."

__label__1,"OK, but...: This book is fine for people new to the topic. It details how events in past lives affect what's happening in the current one. Has only a smattering of info about life BETWEEN lives. Also tells of famous cases historically. But if you've already read very much on the subject, read Journey of Souls by Michael Newton (and see the reviews), which addresses much more about about life BETWEEN lives."

I bought this for a gift an wasnt happy at all. ecom did refund my money in a timley fashion. I just won't buy a remanufatured Samsung audio player due to the poor quality."
__label__1,"No Performance Gains at all: I've had this K&N on my Jeep Wrangler for several months now and have found that it really does not give me any gains in fuel economy or horsepower. At best, I've noticed it does make the exhaust system sound a little louder but that does not translate to any performance boost in freeway, street, or off-road driving. To be honest, I didn't buy this system because of any claims by the manufacturer that it would boost fuel or performance, I bought it so I wouldn't have to replace the air filter as often. I live in an extremely dusty area and do a lot of off-roading. The K&N is easy to clean and eliminates the need to constantly buy the stock paper filters. It also seems to filter better than the stock filters. If you're looking for the performance boost that K&N claims then I wouldn't waste your money on this system, if you're just looking for a more efficient air filter over stock then try it but it is expensive for what you get."
__label__2,"Review For 2000-2001 Combat Fleets of The World: In general, it is a good book. It is a cheaper alternative to Jane's Fighting Ships, a good guide for warships but at $530 a copy very expensive. In addition to being a catalog of warships for each of the navies of the world, this book also talks about in depth about the weapons, electronic systems, and aircrafts that each of the world's navies uses. This is also an advantage that this book has over Jane's Fighting Ships since Jane's mostly focus on the warships and briefly on the weapons, electronic systems, and aircrafts for the world's navies.However, there is no color photographs in this book, only black and white photographs. Some of the description of the warships are a little too brief; some don't even have a schematic for them.Overall, I would recommend this book with the above mentioned reservation."
__label__1,"Flawed: When this book was first published, it was largely panned for its research methodology. The responses and conclusions are suspect because the interviewers were deemed too aggressive in collecting the data.This book is interesting only as a object lesson in what happens when a person is asked personal questions they don't want to answer."

__label__2,"Amazingly fun....But Very Challenging on level 6, 7, so on!: This is a great game. The Prism 3D Engine makes the graphics amazing! this game is an amazing Fire Fighting game. As you get farther in the game, the levels get extremely hard. You also get less time to complete the levels. This game is a definate ""MUST BUY!!!"""

Don't buy this, not even to find out what people are talking about!! He sends flames to people bragging how our complains are making him rich. Not to mention how insulting those mails are. You'd think an author would have better arguments than calling people names!!..."
__label__1,"Great photographic service, poor contents!: Great outlook but rather disappointing from the Beverage technical point of view. The Barman should take some Cuban vacations!"
__label__1,"TERRIBLE: First, I wished I had checked the reviews before purchasing! I have owned other Bushnell Binoculars, but these are by far the worst I have used. I took an Alaska trip and nearly every time I used the binoculars it was necessary to re-focus both lenses. I would not recommend these at all, there are many better pairs of binoculars on the market for a comparable price."
__label__2,"So very sexy: All four stories in this book were excellently written, and as I read them, I could relate to the characters in each story. That is how I know I've read a wonderful book..when I can relate to the characters."
__label__2,great mozart: In my opinion the clarinet quintet is one of Mozart's best chamber works. I am familiar with two other versions and this is the best of the three not so much for the strings - which are beautiful here - but for the wonderful tone in Antony Pay's clarinet. It is deeper and richer than that of the players in the other versions. Specifically I recently purchased Talich on Calliope records as part of their string quintets collection and while the string tone on that recording is wonderful the clarinet pales beside Pay's.The other two pieces here are also quite enjoyable but do not rise above the general run of Mozart's generally good chamber works.The sound is good.
__label__1,"It wasn't for me: I tried to enjoy this book, I really did. i enjoy paranormal romance, but this one was a bit too far fetched even for me. There weren't any believable aspects to this story."
__label__2,"Best movie of the year!: Gangs of New York is one of those rare films that grows on you after seeing it, the more time passes and the more you think about it. Like lots of movies, I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but unlike most, my opinion of the movie has grown with reflection. The story, script and acting are all top notch, and the 19th century urban American setting is a virtually untouched goldmine of dramatic potential. Destined to become a classic."
__label__1,"Pure Schlock, she's laughing at you all the way to the bank...: I found my in a thrift shop for a buck and had to see what all the fuss is about. She is pure sensationalist garbage. She is trying to be some kind of clown or comedian. What a crock. I wouldn't wipe my ass with her."
__label__1,Worst Product: Impossible to clean. DOES NOT COME WITH SECOND COVER. You cant remove the straps to clean them so they become filthy. Adjusting the straps to higher on the shoulders is impossible because you cant get into that part of the chair. This is a horrible highchair. Dont be fooled by the cute fabric.
__label__1,"Fallacious Arguments: Undoubtedly, felons who commit heinous crimes deserve to be sentenced to death. There is no argument there. In my view, child molestors, murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society. It should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this cannot excuse let alone justify his actions. This is irrefutable! As is well-known, psychopaths are usually cunning, insidious, manipulative, narcissistic and charming. Moreover, they are unable to feel guilt and remorse. Rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work. Notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release. Psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd. Therefore, capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence."
__label__2,"Works great for most purposes; can't see detail: I use this to keep an eye on my dogs who stay in our downstairs hallway during the day. The camera's resolution is indeed low, but I can see my whole hallway illuminated with only 3 75 Watt recessed ceiling lights, and I can see that both my dogs are there and whether they are sleeping, playing or eating. The camera was super easy to set up and has given me zero problems. It picks up my wireless router that is two whole stories up with no problem. It works fine with IE6 or IE7, which is all I use. If you need to see detail like the expression on a person's face, this won't do it. But for most purposes it is just fine!"
__label__2,"Fun and Learning Game: I purchased this game for my 4 year old grandson. He has spent many hours playing the game. Since I am a former preschool teacher, I am please with the many learning skills that are included."
__label__2,"lovin' it: so far loving this product, the screen is clear, the downloads are easy and the choice of type face convienientthe only thing I could mention is the battery does not last as long as advertised, but if you plan ahead for that then no worries !"
__label__2,Cheese topping: This is a great powdered cheese topping for popcorn and garlic bread. It has been hard to find at the grocery stores.
__label__1,"Yeah right.: A gunfight in the Hyatt?! I live here. Even toy pistols resembling the real thing are banned.Either Tom or Martin should spend some time here before even trying to emulate ""Singlish"", some of the dialogue made me wince.Finished the book in less than 24 hours. Not too engaging. Thanks to Steve who lent me the book, 3 years here and your ""lahs"" are still wrong. :-)"
__label__2,"Lyrics in a daze...: The song ""Marvelous Things"" from this EP is what brought me to Eisley in the first place. The song is simply magical. The thing I like about Eisley is that their music doesn't try to personify some rock star personality. It's a bunch of girls writing about their world."
__label__2,barking collar: When its charged it works great and has really helped with the nuisance barking. The only problem is that you cannot tell when it needs to be recharged as the light stays off even after its fully charged.
__label__1,"Weak, even for B horror: I was very disapointed with Jack Frost. I rented it years ago when it was a new release in the video store and really enjoyed it. I even bought it but never popped it in until recently. This time around my opinion changed big time. I'm not sure what I was thinking when I originally thought it was so great. It really was awful. I am a big fan of B movies but this was just too goofy. I wasn't expecting much, but this didn't do anything for me. I think it's the best when a movie really tries to be serious but is too ridiculous to be anything but funny. But when a movie knows it's so bad they try to make it funny is a different story. As much as I'd love to love a movie about a killer snowman, I just can't. I'd pass on this if you have the chance."
__label__1,Very disappointed: This publication was very disappointing. I expected much more than it had . did not hav near enough detailand explanations were very vague and incomplete.
__label__2,"Works Great: I bought this even though I was concerned how it would handle in tight areas. I race dirt cars and rivet body panels on it all the time. I'm happy to say I don't run into too many problems with this rivet gun because of it's size. It makes riveting a snap. Even if you do need to rivet in areas this gun can't get into, it's worth buying this one and another smaller one, because this one is so easy to use.It beats straining yourself with one of those small single hand riveters, but at the same time don't need to worry about pneumatic only rivet guns."
__label__1,"Wrong size, bad materials, total waste of money.: The way this style humdifier works is by pulling air through the wet filter and blowing it out to the room. If the air doesn't get pulled through the filter, no moisture makes it to the room. The filter must be sitting in the water in the tray, and must make contact with the bottom of the fan so the only route for the air is through the filter.These filters are a bit short. So they don't touch the bottom of the fan. So the air just cruises right over the top and dries out the filter in the process. In the meantime you still have a room with 25% humidity because all your humidifier is doing is blowing dry room air out the top.I'm ordering Holmes filters from now on."
__label__2,Extremely useful and good place to start: I use my Nano to listen while riding the public transit. It's perfect! I did not get it for the radio but I have used it once and it's not bad either. I love the fact that it uses AAA batteries that are widely available. This is a great little player and I'm thinking of getting another for my wife.
__label__2,"This book teaches us that it is okay to define our success: I think Ms. O""Brien hit the nail right on the head. What it is all about is being able to define what YOU believe is the key to success and to live you life in that way. As long as you live up to your expectations, that is what really counts. At least to me anyway.On another note, I personally met Ginny and she is a fabulous person with extrordinary insight. Her book is not a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, but actual experiences of real people. I would recommend this book for those who question their idea of success. It is very enlightening."
__label__1,"Poorly written: Poorly written book. Little continuity, small diagrams, too much information thrown at you on each page. Not well organized. Good for research maybe, NOT as a text book."
__label__1,"not worth the money: Completely disjointed, bad graphics, stiff characters, obscure puzzles. And I paid $39.99 by pre-ordering from ecom.ca and saw it on EB's shelf 2 days before I got my copy from ecom, for $19.99!!!!! $20.00 cheaper!!!! Live and learn....And it's not even worth the $19.99 IMO. Save your money."
__label__2,"The Short Stories of B.H. Betzman: The book has 16 short stories, of several subjects: romantic, breaking into places, photography, up to day stories and many other issues. B.T. Betzman is very knowledgeable in many subjects, including guns, hospitals, photography, automobiles and others. That knowledge makes the great majority of his stories interesting, and some grab you in a way that you cannot put the book down until you finish reading the story. B.T. Betzman has a great command of the English language and uses very precise and correct words. I have enjoyed the book and will not hesitate to recommend to anyone for reading. He is not yet a well-known author, but time will change that."
__label__2,"NOISE AIN'T ROCK AND ROLL POLUSION: brise-glace. hmmmmm-- this band has managed to tear apart, reshape, slice and dice any normal idea of what rock music might be. from the opening peice, a collage of sound giving way finally to heavy drums and random guitars, they dig deep into their bag of electronic noise making goodies, constructing thick noise textures and every once in a while some recognisable structure. but when these guys do bring things together, they really hit you hard with it. this is definately an interesting record, and if you stay with the more difficult listening they'll usually reward you with an excellent rock passage or something more listenable."
__label__1,"I'll never get those hours back: I saw this crapfest in the theater and I should have known what I was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window, but at the entrance of the theater as well. I only gave it one star because there wasn't a ""no star"" rating--even though it deserves a negative rating.As a horror fan, I was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started, it seemed to have alot of promise. But once we met Baby and her ""family"" the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate. The movie was disgusting, repulsive, and made no clear sense--at least with Michael or Freddie you knew what the h*ll was going on. And I thought that Blood Sucking Freaks and Blood Sucking Vampires from Pittsburgh sucked, but Corpses not only sucked, it blew. As a friend told me later, ""What in the h*ll did you expect from Rob Zombie?"" What did I expect indeed. No wonder most production firms refused to touch this film."
__label__1,"Looks great. Too bad it stopped working.: These are great looking fans. Silent. They move the air around. I bought two from different sellers on ecom. BOTH stopped working! The most recent was 9 months after purchase. The seller Del Mar was great. They're sending a new fan. Whew. Unfortunately I still have to pay an electrician to reinstall. I wouldn't buy another minka fan, which is too bad, since they look great. Just too much trouble to replace."
__label__2,"""Carpenter Action Thriller Classic!"": Austin Stoker and Darwin Joston star in John Carpenter's1976 action thriller. A group of people are trapped ina police station under siege by a gang. This is oneof Carpenter's best and Stoker and Joston are greatin it. This dvd has good picture and sound plus neatextras. I recommend this classic."
__label__2,"Best country music singer ever...: This is an excellent investment to add to your collection. I actually bought it six years ago when I first saw it ang it has all the well known music also some music I hadn't heard but it is all good. I am 25 yrs old and I don't remember Marty too well but I do remember the day that he died, my grandmother was devestated and my mom was too. My grandma always listened to his music and that is why I now listen to it. If my grandma had been alive when this album came out you can bet that she wouuld have been the first one at the store to buy it."
__label__2,"What a relief!: A Christmas album that is elegant and humble, happy to be played in the background at GenX parties and happy to be heard that way! What a relief and blessing!"
__label__1,Not a good product: This is not a good product. I bought a set and one stopped working with in the first hour. The working Bud produced loud whistling noise. These are made to use out side. The noise is even worse if worn out side in the wind. Save your money.
__label__1,"Obsolete: I bought the Kindle version. This book is obsolete. It covers Tomcat 4. The current version is Tomcat 7. This book was written around 2003, before Tomcat 4 was released. The description on ecom for the Kindle version doesn't inform the purchaser as to the Tomcat Version, and the publish date is shown on ecom as 2009 (which is the publish date for the ebook version, not the original book). This is extremely misleading.This book is highly rated on ecom, but mostly the reviews are about the paperback version and are as old as the book.I returned this book. ecom should remove it from its shelves.However, if you want to know how to install & run Tomcat on a Windows 2000 system, you wont find a better guide!"
__label__1,"A big disappointment: I was really let down by this book because it doesn't address the financing crisis in this country, and how we can pay for care."
__label__2,"Good text.: A well-written and entertaining text. Not as good as Den Hartog's text on advanced strength of materials, but good anyway."
__label__1,"Call it something by another name!: To edit a book in order to make it into a movie such as 'The Fellowship of the Ring' did, is very common place and acceptable. After all squeezing an epic reading experience into 2 hours is impossible. On the other hand what happened in 'The Two Towers'(?) is like splatting some paint onto a canvas and passing it off as a Picasso. To alter the inherent nature of a main character is a crime against the book, and no longer worthy of it's title. Peter Jackson could just as well have started from scratch and made a great movie, but let's face it, he wanted to cash in on a much loved classic, not honor it."
__label__2,Complete surrender: No Brighter Dream was superb. I applaud Katherine's writing ability it is simply magical. I'm an avid romance reader and I was just not expecting the kind of depth that I felt in this novel. When you read the back it's interesting enough but once you get into it you just won't want to tear yourself away. The ending I might add brought tears to my eyes. Bravo Katherine you're one of a kind.
__label__1,"So-so: I remember when ""No Matter What"" came out on the radio and I thought, ""Did the Beatles reunite?!!!"" I hoped Badfinger would be the ""new Beatles"" and bought ""Straight Up"". After recently buying this CD, I was disappointed to the point that tonight I put ""Straight Up"" on my wishlist to replace the album. I bought this CD mostly for ""No Matter What"", otherwise I would sell it. If you want non-stop GREAT songs from Badfinger, there is nothing better than ""Straight Up""."
__label__2,"This Church Has Mass Appeal!: I bought this album after seeing Eric Church and his band open for Bob Seger last December. Yes it's country, but it's country with a kick. Eric sings with the soul of an old man... a guy who's lived life to the fullest, loved and lost, and lived to sing about his insightful, sometimes comical experiences. The good thing: We can all relate to Eric's musings over family, friends and females. The music rocks. It touches your heart. Country fan or not, I'd recommend this album to any lover of good, lyrically powerful music."
__label__2,":Peek-A-Boo"" by Jant & Allen Ahlberg: I just received a Viking 1981 larger edition of this book. Part of the charm the Ahlberg authors are known for is their wording, but it's been omitted. It has different words,and far less words than the 'look inside' version ecom shows. This newer larger size edition leaves the story up to the imagination of the reader. In the original editions I saw (which were smaller), the detailed illustrations are the same, but the wording also lets us know to look for and explains certain specific things in a rhyming delightful sing song way. If I order again, I might get the same copy without the endearing descriptions of a family going about their day, in a time past. The small version gets 5 stars, the larger newer watered down version gets 3. ecom lists this as the Miniature Edition, so that might make the difference- buy the minature edition not the regular or large size."
__label__1,"review of the compilation: I regret that i got carried away by the recommendations given on my previous purchases as well as the other reviews on this compilation""Peel slowly and see"" is definitely one of the worst in my collection.It sounded more like a jam session by a not so talented garage band! Do i say more.Can i have my money back or atleast exchange the same for some better music?"
__label__2,great story: i liked the book alot but i could have come up with a better endind despite that it was really good goes into good detail.
__label__1,"re: clinical handbook: no wonder the item was soo cheap, it was an earlier edition; the image or picture they posted was of the latest edition. the item was in good condition, though, and it came quickly. just hoped the seller gave a more accurate description."
__label__2,A Must Have If You Order A Portable Hard Drive: If you plan on taking your hard drive with you this case is a good investment. I ordered this case along with the purchase of the Toshiba Canvio Plus 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive. The hard drive fits well in the case and the case seems to be well made. I would recommend this case.
__label__2,"Not for ""traditional"" Willie fans.: If you like traditional country than you may not like this, it's rather different, good different not bad different. Most songs are pretty popesque rather than traditional country. I like (not love but can listen to some) Willie Nelson music and this is not like that but well worth a try just don't expect old Willie style music."
__label__2,"GREAT to see them out of role: What an fun hour, seeing and hearing these people all as they are in real life! Very interesting anecdotes, and very enjoyable for anyone who loves The Closer!"
__label__1,hard to read: map is very hard to read and not categorized very well. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
__label__2,"Fun read!: I really enjoyed this book! It's a nice, quick read. I thought the characters were well developed and I enjoyed the paranormal story of Alaisdair and Viola as well. The only problem I have with the story is that I found the ending a little trite and weak. But, if you like romance / paranormal romance stories, I would definitely recommend this book. I'm about to order the next one. Enjoy!"
__label__1,"Zach Galifianakis - Live at the Purple Onion: It feels like he got the money upfront and just phoned it in, not his best by far. Since I sometimes perform at the Purple Condiment, thanks Zach, this makes me feel better about my lame material."
__label__2,"Great Extras!: This is probably the most deluxe set I've seen for any series. All the little extras are great.I was surprised by the English version of the series. To be honest, I think all of the voices are pretty fitting, with the exception of Kyon's. The English voice actor just doesn't carry the same tone of righteous anger the original Kyon had.That being said, if you enjoyed the Japanese version, you will enjoy the English version."
__label__2,"3333333333: yea the titled is retarded, but this cd is slamming. The only problem is deez tracks are just to short. but theyre good though. i dont see why they had 5 seconds of silence on track 13, that was silly! but yea, its not really a juggalo cd....its subject matter isnt retarded and it wont only grab the attention of retards....im glad Zug went their own way, they much better like this."
__label__2,"Hazel is great!!!: Having watched this series as a child I was delighted to find it out on DVD. We have purchased all four seasons and have made ""Hazel night"" a weekly event. It brings us back to a time where life seemed simple and all problems were successfully handled. Just a pleasant, feel good program that we have thoroughly enjoyed."
__label__2,"Victim of Deception: This was a very interesting story. The opening paragraph would indicate it was a purely sexual book with no plot or story. However within two or three pages I found myself engrossed in a rather good story. After about ten pages, I was hooked. The plot, the character development, everything about it was really well done. I enjoyed the book and was disappointed when it ended. There was nothing wrong with the book, only I wanted to continue reading."
__label__1,"Bloated and pretentious: So many people are enthralled with Proulx's style, which I find maddeningly self-serving and completely devoid of substance. Her addiction to metaphor and superfluous adjectives makes her writing ""lyrical"" to some, but I think it's a sloppy mess. Ah, if only real critics like Rebecca West were still around to give writers like Ms. Proulx the reprimanding she deserves for writing in such an unfocused way, eager to impress through vocabulary rather than lucid imagery or concentrated characterization. Many times the images she concocts are contradictory, and simply don't make sense. If you want style, beauty, and insight, read the master with whom she shares the first four letters of her name. There you will find genius."
__label__2,"Bjork at her best: The M-tv live portion is really good.I think thathomogenic is a good record,and it works live.But the real treat is the unplugged performance.The live versions of the debut songs are arrangedamazingly.It would be a risk for anyone to altersounds as radically as she did with these musicians.a true testament to how in tune the woman is."
__label__2,"Very nice set of cookware: The Emerilware set of stainless steel cookware is great, heavy duty stuff. Our son is a professional chef, and he recommended stainless steel over any other type of cookware. The price was right for this set also. The pans and skillets are heavy and conduct heat evenly. Another nice feature is that the handles stay cool because of the design."
__label__1,"Warning to Charlotte Church fans!!: To Charlotte Church fans who are considering the purchase of this DVD for the Charlotte Church performance only, reconsider. ""Danny Boy"" is straight and unadulterated off of ""Voice of an Angel in Concert"". Save your money if Charlotte Church is the only reason you are considering this. You already have it."
__label__2,Read while pregnent: This book stars while you're still pregnent. I felt so guilty when I started reading this book about all the stuff I missed out on doing.
__label__2,"Aperture 2.1.1: Great editing tool. A little confusing at first but worth it. One thing Apple needs to cure. When downloading, Aperture picks up all photos, images on your computer and puts them into Aperture"
__label__1,"boring even with all the sex...: Wow - what inane characters! With Helen, or Helen of Troy, teasing the womanizing Lord Beechman early on, one understands that the author has designated Helen as the supposedly ""spunky"" gal who can handle a man early on. I had no real issue with the sex scenes. I like sex. But she went over the top re. the domination bit. It got really boring. Also, what the heck happened to Alexnadra and Douglas - are they middle aged already? Also, Lord Beechman was a bit of a bore being so fascinated with such a tease as Helen. Got old...."
__label__2,"Good, Not Great: It's a fun story for the young ones, and the illustrations are fabulously entertaining. The story itself with the ugly monster and creepy crawlers makes it engaging and sure to keep the interest of kids. But the book makes me wonder why the main character appears to be a Native American boy. This doesn't appear to be relevant to the story, though the illustrator's note mentions that some of the art was inspired by Native American art. Which group or tribe?"
__label__1,Can't review unt il readd: I n ever receivied this book and never heard from them via e-mail to them.Thank you.
__label__1,"Okay, but not for everyone: According to Mary Hale her diet therapy for CFIDS will help everyone but I don't agree. It is very strict and punishing and according to her you must eliminate any kind of fruit from your diet because it contains sugar. According to her sugar is a no-no for people with CFIDS but that has not been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. No two people who have CFIDS are the same and she makes it sound like everyone is. Just remember this, check with your doctor before starting any kind of diet."
__label__2,"The Truth: This is a concise presentation of closest thing to the truth that is known about these animals. When all of the facts are examined about these amazing creatures, this book explains in a very easy to understand and logical manner what the actual history of the dinosaurs is. Please bear in mind that this viewpoint is sometimes violently attacked by athiests and secular humanists who aren't particularly concerned with the facts. I highly recommend this book, not only for children, but as an introduction to this concept for adults."
__label__2,"remarkable value: This coffeemaker is quiet, fast, nice looking, and easy to use. I have encountered no problems with closing the basket, as described by others. And yes, the coffee does stay warm in the carafe for hours. The carafe itself is easily worth the cost of the product. Shipping was fast and item was securely packaged and arrived in perfect condition - not a single indication that it was ""remanufactured."" All programming functions work as described, and programming the unit takes seconds. Instruction manual clear, easy to understand.Only oddity is the slow rate of pouring through the top of the carafe, still haven't figured this one out and will keep trying. When pouring coffee, one wants to get the cup filled quickly, but the top of my carafe prevents this from happening, and the coffee kind of dribbles out so slowly that filling the cup takes 3X as long as it should. Other than that, fabulous!"
__label__1,"Disappointing-the topic deserves a broader viewpoint: I enjoy most Country Living books and Irish Country was an intriguing topic. This treatment unfortunately is a very shallow look at a very limited amount of examples of pottery, fabric, and furniture. Many of the items are obscure and one doesn't get a real feel for the richness of the topics. Its not really a decorating book either - its focus is substantially on replicating the look of some of the material (pottery, fabrics, etc) through do-it-yourself crafts. For example, I didn't learn anything about the variety of Irish furniture and how to decorate with it. Hate to be so negative but I felt like the title and book cover were false advertising."
__label__2,Goosebumps: A scary tale. From the beginning to the end this book will keep you turning pages with the lights on.
__label__1,"Bad: I still have not received this item, not sure what is going on ? If you have any answers I would love to hear about it? Thankx"
__label__2,loving you tamia: This song is absolutely gorgeous! Her vocals are amazing and can reduce you to tears. I cried the first time i heard it.
__label__1,"Disappointing cup of coffee!: The only reason this coffee maker received two stars is for the convenience factor. If you are considering a single serve system, run don't walk. Run to the Tassimo by Braun. The Tassimo reads a bar code for each type of coffee selected (latte, expresso,capaccino, etc.) and adds the perfect amount of water as well as separately steaming the milk for speciality coffee choices. You enjoy a perfect cup of coffee each time. The Keurig, on the other hand, has a Mickey Mouse system: it only allows you to choose three cups sizes which means you get kind of watery coffee,very watery coffee,or dishwater. Our Keurig is not even worth ""regifting."" We have, however, purchased a second Tassimo for our summer home and have also purchased two others as gifts. Enjoy!"
__label__2,"Better than the movie?: YES! This book gets better every time I read it. After reading it 5 times through, I feel I'm about ready to head out and do some fly-fishing! Late at night my family gathers around the fireplace as I read them passages from the book. I'm hoping my kids will grow up just like those boys. Ever since i first read this book, my life has changed. Im starting to pay my taxes, my family life is great, and i have more friends than ever. Every month i go out and by a new copy of the book, acting as if i've never read it before. If i could give this book more than 5 stars, i sure would. My relationship with my girlfriends are great now! and my wife says I'm beginning to act like the man she married again. THANK YOU norman f. madean. thank you!"
__label__1,"Stale, flat, unprofitable.: I really tried to like this movie, but couldn't see much humour in it. I couldn't work up any interest in the characters (Kobé Tai as Tina the [Dead] Hooker was the most honest of them), and found the action fairly predictable and disbelief impossible to suspend. Plot was thin to begin with, and errors in details were annoying: the amount of blood in the washroom indicated the hooker was still alive long after she was supposed to be dead; it's very hard to kill anyone with the type of corkscrew supposedly used (don't they have anyone testing these things out?); and you can't clean up evidence as easily as that. Winston Wolf knew better... Others have pointed out further plot flaws which would have kept Boyd's scheme from working. Shock value is minimal, other than the sheer splatter effect, and that has been overused elsewhere to better effect. This movie has nothing of interest that's new, and nothing new that's of interest."
__label__2,Exceptional Value and Information!: This Brazilian Jiu Jitsu series shocked me. For the price it actually offers much more than stated. I found each DVD to be almost 90 minutes and packed with the most complete techniques and explanations I have ever seen on instructionals and I have many. The Brazilian Master Froes is truly an expert who's teaching is easy to comprehend and follow. The camera work is super and nothing is missed. A fascinating and effective martial art you can learn well from this series and super deal...
__label__1,"This TV version defines Trash Television...: While this TV version is more faithful to the book in its plotting, that is all it has going for it. This version is not in the least bit effective as a horror tale, while the book is. This TV version is pure trash.The Kubrick version is genius. Kubrick took from the book the elements he liked best and then recreated it into fine art, even though the book was at best a good work of pulp fiction.Kubrick should have called his film by a diferent title so as to not upset those who loved the book in literal terms, but economically he had to keep the same title.Kubricks version is a metaphorical and allegorical masterpiece.The book is great as literal entertainment.The TV version fails completely, except for its execution of the literal from the book."
__label__2,"Taunting ""Haunted"": Chuck Palahniuk's got an incredibly creative mind. That's why I love reading his work. He comes up with stories that titilate the mind while churning the stomach. Unfortunately, this latest ""novel"" should have remained just a collection of intriguing -- yet disturbing -- short stories.In ""Haunted,"" Palahniuk tries to weave them all together by creating a storyline between each short story that features the characters in each of the short stories. Unfortunately, it's this ongoing storyline that is the weakest part of the book, as it lost this reader's interest. In addition to this ongoing storyline, there are poems about each of the characters that I could have done without before each of the short stories.While the ongoing storyline of characters ""trapped"" inside a house had a couple of interesting moments, it's the short stories that truly make this book worth having in your collection."
__label__2,Daughter loves this book!: My 10yr old daughter is in love with this book and is constantly asking me to buy her another book! Which says a lot for a story!
__label__2,"A recording for the principles: This is a fine recording if you admire the voices of the three principles: Hampson, Hadley and Mentzer, which I do. You will find them at their best and most musical. However, if you do not care for them then I wouldn't recommend buying this recording. Besides the absurd three disc price, the ensemble and conducting is not very memorable. For a fine digital recording, I'd reccomend the Larmore, Hagagard set or, for a budget price, the Ganassi, Vargas recording is superb. As far as a classic recording, the Callas is awesome."
__label__2,Lund Hitch-Mounted Cargo Carrier-- worth the price: Nice. It will work just fine. Some bolts and screws rusted immediately upon install even though we live in the Nevada dessert but should be ok now that I've repainted.
__label__1,"A step backwards...: I purchased this shaver when my old Spectra 8894 needed new blades and I am very sorry that I did so. I can't get as good a shave with this new shaver as I can with my old one with worn blades. I am trying to find out if there is a way I can return it because it is a waste of money. Additionally, the trimmer is very small and difficult to use because you have to see what you are doing around the cutting heads. While this is subjective, the unit feels cheap and flimsy compared to my old Norelco."
__label__2,"Very Suspensful: Coma was a very thrilling book! Every page was a new experience. I recommend the book to readers who are patient and that love to read. It is a long book and the beginning is hard to get into. After you get past that beginning part, Coma is a book about a Med student who is taking a job at the Memorial Hospital. She finds out some really strange things and almost gets killed! Read Coma by Robin Cook."
__label__1,"Not worth it!: Disappointing performance. I bought it to siphon water contaminated gasoline from a built in tank in a small outboard boat. The mechanics are such that you need lots of verticle clearance to ""pump the tube vigorously."" Can't be done in a constricted curving fill pipe.It might be good for emptying a barrel or hot tub.Gave it away!"
__label__1,"Arrogant and Disappointingly Simple: He offers some speculating advice and that's about it! The rest of the information is very basic knowledge and about education services he provides which can be bought for a fee. The author appeared quite arrogant throughout, even going as far to name the standard real estate cycle after himself! There were a lot of ""I did this!"" and ""I did that!"" and ""I'm so wonderful to help people!"" This book is not worth your time, unless you enjoy reading the advertisement section of the newspaper, only without the fancy pictures and print."
__label__1,"DVR....Not DVD.: Picture & sound quality rate 1 star, movie itself, rates 2 stars.Horrible transfer brings little enjoyment of this movie.Defeats the whole reason for having DVD.As for the movie itself, low budget ""southern gothic"", slasher film.Last film role for Agnes Moorehead. She's wonderful in the film, but even she can't save this dud of a movie. In the same vein as Dementia 13."
__label__2,Exactly what I always wanted....: I looked long and hard for a breadmaker. I researched and researched for many months to find one that would fit my way of life and here it is. This machine not only makes bread but it also makes flavored butter and desserts I was amazed! The bread comes out perfect everytime. I use it atleast once a week sometimes more. My family loves all the new creations I have made with it. Now we can enjoy breads and desserts that are made with healthy ingredients not stuff you can't pronounce. I wanted something that would give me the power to bring in choices in our lives and this bread machine did exactly that and then some.
__label__1,Terrible: I received it in a terrible condition.All the cases(4 of them) were broken.Thou the CDs were not scratched.
__label__2,"Exciting Ongoing Exploration of String Theory...: Already having an extensive science background and an interest in cosmology, physics and astronomy for years, I found Lisa Randall's book incredibly provocative and fascinating. (I was also delighted to discover a WOMAN in this field predominantly filled with male physicists...) Honestly, it may be a little over the head of someone with little or no science background, unless, of course, they were highly motivated and interested in the subject to begin with. I would put it right up there with Brian Greene's works (The Elegant Universe, etc.) in that it makes the subject very relevant to everyday existence as well as existential questions. (As an aside, I would also supplement your reading with viewing the DVD, ""What the (Bleep)? Down the Rabbit Hole"" to contemplate string theory's possibility of connecting science to spirituality...)"
__label__2,"Excellent reading and well documented: This book clearly shows without question, the existence of Jesus Christ, and has supplied numerous documented sources to prove it."
__label__2,"Just Chillin': This unit as purchased as a gift for a friend in Colorado and I think the rating can be summarized with her first two comments after she received it.""Gosh, it takes a lot of water *giggle* "" and a little later, ""aaaaaaahhh, my room feels so cool now.""Thank You for just what was needed.Roger"

__label__2,"Great ideas!!: I bought this book for my Masters class and absolutely love it. It has so many great ideas in it for teachers and parents. I think all preschool, pre-k and kindergarten teachers should own this book. Its very easy to read and even has pictures!!!"
__label__2,"good but not as good as Dc Talk: I liked the general sound of the group but better yet are the lyrics. songs that relly can touch you heart or leave you cold I like pretty well but it can't be compaired to Dc Talk their music is good in general but songs like the company car were funny once but twice was a bit much. it reminds me of Audio Audrenalin's underdog. they are good but not spectatular. I would recomend this album in general, but they do not have the same sparcle and perfection of Dc Talk. if your looking for good go to Dc Talk if you have that and are looking on look here. Dc Talk may be famouse but that is not unwarented, thier music is the best and that is it, I have found very few artest even in the secular comunity that can beet Dc Talk. This group they are hard enough to please but not absoloutly hard core. if your looking for something good this is relativly good but not wonderful beyond expectations."
__label__2,"Fantastic: Great blend of top-notch musicians (Robben Ford, Jim Keltner), Jim's own fine grand piano playing, some really great tunes, and some whacky, but still mighty fine tunes make for a great cocktail here. The style is relaxed soul blues, a little bit of stride piano even. It definitely stands out, and the production, especially of the grand, is simply SUPERB! This CD helped sell me my stereo, and afterwards I got the salesperson to order me a copy (not so easy to find in Denmark). I highly recommend it!"
__label__1,"Disappointed: I was so excited to get this item after reading the other reviews. I was impressed when I did receive it, the quality is very good and it works great. I followed the directions exactly for getting my two cats used to this new box. However, ater two weeks of trying, they just refuse to use it and have found a corner to use instead....uggghhhh!!!!! I think it is just to small inside and they are not overly large cats nor are they timid in any way. Lots of money for something that should be more accomadating. So, very disappointed that this did not work for me. I hope you consider my experience before buying one."
__label__1,"WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED, BEAT, & TERRORIZED. OH HOW FUN...: I watched this when I was a young girl & it still haunts me to this day. If you enjoy watching a woman get viciously raped for almost an hour then this is the movie for you."

__label__2,"Kid in Black: What a strange album. For those wanting to help their youngsters learn early on to walk the line, this amalgam of song and spoken word is a strange but wonderful introduction to the Man in Black. Some songs, ""Nasty Dan"" and ""Tiger Whitehead"" for example, are simply swell -danceable for the very young and their buffoonish parents- other tracks drag, and the final monologue, which includes the line ""Russians are red,"" smacks of the absurdity that underlies the concept of a children's album by the man who ""shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die."" Cash fans, who know that many Cash albums come with one or two songs that will make them blush at the oddity of their message or delivery (Like ""Live at San Quentin?"" ...remember ""Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart""), will be willing to look past the drippy ""Little Magic Glasses"" and see the true warmth of songs like ""I Got A Boy And His Name Is John"" and the album as a whole. Others, stick to Raffi."
__label__1,The WORST THING EVEEEEEEEEER!: I can not believe you can not get 0 stars because this was no doubt the worst pay per view ever.The only great match was Eddie Gurrero against Rey Mysterio. The worst match was every other match I swere to god that you will fall asleep in the final match.I can not believe that Beniot and Jordan could go so long in that match. Benoit could've beaten Orlano Jordan within 1 minute.Please use your money on something else then this piece of stupid trash
__label__1,"I was in this film: Yikes, it had the makings of being a funny T n' A / cult type movie but near the end the cheesy ""games"" were just too cheesy. It almost was a cool commentary on cheesy movies but lost that vision, if ever it had that vision. All I could do was be my best in my part. That and convince my movie girlfriend that we should make out (a lot!) before the cameras roll. Since we were supposed to be dating for awhile, our first kiss should not be on camera. I asked that our scene not involve nudity. There was plenty of that with the other performers anyway. More fun making than watching. But so is life!"
__label__1,This is one you can miss: Wasn't happy with this one. The actress was not the same one as the first movie.
__label__2,"One of the Best Movies Ever: This movie is a blessing. Star Trek at the top of its game. It's a shame that today we are still having environment issues involving whales species, considering the strong message presented on the storyline."
__label__1,"Was it a bad year?: I'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing. I kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that I lose interest in these stories half way thru. They all seem too long, unfocussed. What they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories. The quality puzzles me because I'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf I read in the zines. I haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing."
__label__1,"Can you say ""editor""?: Hard to read because it was presumably not proof read at all. Story is good but hard to enjoy. Send it to me or any grammer school student for free editing but don't publish like this one was."
__label__2,A Sad Love Story: This book was so sad. I felt sorry for Chancey because he loved Tia so much and changed his life to make her feel comfortable. I was really pushing for their relationship to work because his mother was a mean witch and his friend (the bad one) was a snake so all he had was her. Such a sad story but true.
__label__2,"good times: I was so glad when these collections were finally released. The first 3 seasons with Trapper and Henry are the absolute best. What I liked better in the first season was that they kept it light and fun. They started dealing with deeper issues later. I also liked Radar's character better in the first season. He was sharp and clever and not as innocent. On the other hand, Klingers character started to blossom after the first season. I never get tired of his crazy, side slitting antics. He is such a colorful character. The only thing about MASH that never sat well with me was all the infidelity. That's what I appreciated about Col. Potter and B.J. in the later shows. They proved that you can still be funny when faithful."
__label__2,"Great in-ear headphones: I wear both ""cans"" and in-ear headphones and these are the best in-ear phones I've found. Take the time to try all the sizes and types (rubber vs foam) of ear buds. You need a good seal in the ear canal to shut out ambient sound. DO NOT wear jogging or driving where you need to hear outside sounds."
__label__1,Stubborn Twig: This article was not worth the price. It shed no new light on the content of the book. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
__label__2,"From a Ballet Teacher!: I have many technique books that are on the market,and this book tops them all! Most ballet teaching books relate to little kids only, well, this book grows with the student. What I mean is its not sugar coated with pictures of little kids dressed in pink tutus. It shows a real ballerina deminstraiting technique.I like this book,and recomend it to you as well as my students.Kim's school of dance."
__label__1,"Big Mistake: I was really excited when I saw this in the store, so I bought it. It was a huge mistake. I am a die hard Bon Jovi fan and this was just terrible. The music was tacky and it was boring."
__label__1,"A SHAME TO POP MUSIC: This song is a disgrace, even for today MTV-orientated low standards. Never imagined Mariah could ""sing"" (a thing she does not here !!!) so bad, never imagined a song could be so boring and embarrasingly bad, bad, bad. This is her lowest point in her career. What shocke most, beyond the low quality of the tune, is the clear lack of any emotion or belief in what she was doing. THis song is an example of how far bad music can go."
__label__1,"Why???!!!: I was going to give Corey the benefit of the doubt after the whole American Idol thing. But after listening, I found it to be another teeny bobber kind of CD with nothing that really moves you at all.He should have done himself a favor and left his feelings about Paula out of the CD, it makes him look like a wuss."
__label__1,"Not worth the money: While there were some interesting quotes, this book will leave most fans feeling somehow cheated since the entire book could be read by any child or adult in one sitting. It's definitely not so much a book that was researched and then written as it is a book composed of a bunch of quotes all randomly thrown together. There are much better books out there on racing so save your money and buy one of them."
__label__2,Bad Party: The fact that the Dead Milkmen reference this book in one of their songs is enough to let you know that it is a quality read.
__label__1,"caveat emtor: buyer beware! brand new out of the package the unreeled hose and nozzle sprayed water everywhere. The hose leaked in numerous places along its length. The cheap plastic nozzle is all but useless, not only leaking at the coupling but at the valve as well.

__label__1,"Not the best book I ever read: Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time."
__label__2,"Simplified way to get the effects I need: I bought this based on the description here on ecom, and I have to say, I was not disappointed. Many of the 3D and rounded effects that I been using (with as many as 8 various filters) are here, in ""1-Click"" simplicity. I scan the book until I find the effect I am striving for, and apply that filter. It's just that easy. Some required a little tweaking to get the correct color for my projects, but it was SO EASY.I am not a graphic artist, so this book is a relief to me, saving me long hours of experimentation and trial and error. I rec. this book highly.Why only 4 stars? Of the 900 filters in the book, about 25-30% are web/website applications, which I do not use. Other than that, I liked it a lot."
__label__2,This Rox!!: This Soundtrack rox!! and so does the Movie!!!! i am a grl and i totally love it!!! Its My Favorite Movie Ever!! And my fave. song is Hair of the dog by Nazereth!! on the soundtrack! : )
__label__1,"Let's get real: What's with all the five star reviews? Wow. I'm going with two stars because this book is made for kids and does a good job at attracting kids with all its funny pictures. But come on. These are total common sense recipes. If you are getting it for the pictures and for kids to laugh, fine. But for cooking (even for kids), no way. And it is a cookbook rather than just another kids? picture book, right? Seriously, the recipe for ?Eat a Pita Pizza? is ?buy a package of pitas, jarred spaghetti sauce and shredded cheese. Put pitas on tray, put sauce on pitas, put cheese on pitas, put tray in oven at 350% and cook until cheese bubbles?. Now, do you really want to spend hard earned money on that? The recipes are really very insulting. Bam!"
__label__2,"The Great Glass Book: ""Shattering Glass"" by Gail Giles is an outstanding novel. I like the idea of a few guys changing a geek into a popular guy. The author uses up-to-date words, teenage slang, etc. There are some words that are not appropriate to say right now. Read the bok and you'll see what I'm talking about!"
__label__2,"An extremely good book: In this second chilling novel by Darren Shan {sequel to the first called cirque du freak} Darren starts on his journey as a vampires assistant. The roads of life are often lonely and hard, but sometimes more for some. Now it's time for Darren to face one of his greatest fears. Will he choose the road of the vampire, or remain faithful to his humanside and face what's coming? Read and find out.In this exciting novel Darrens adventure starts to unfold. I loved this book and read it more than once. I was captured by this new world of vampires. And lived a new life. I layed reading this taking in every word as if the air I breath. I enjoyed this book immensely even through it's gore.A spectacular book among all the others. Which held me as if by magic."
__label__1,"Didn't work.: I have terrible dandruff. I have seen two dermatologists for prescription medications which did not work. I have tried almost every over the counter treatment and none of them worked. This product was my last attempt, and I used it as directed for two weeks. And again, it did NOTHING to control my dandfuff. I wish I could write a glowing report, but this product was a waste of time and money."
__label__1,"Difficult to search and find the important passages: I decided to take the plunge and try and read the entire Bible from cover to cover -- not just the parts we hear in church. I found it to be horrific. I didn't understand why in all my Sunday classes we did not focus on the entire book. Now I understand why. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the poor index. For example, it failed to identify all seven passages about the sin of homosexuality. Also, I am suspicious that some creative editing has been done as nowhere in the four Gospels is there even one reference to the sin of homosexuality by Jesus. Not one? Also, the immaculate conception is only found in ONE of the four Gospels?? I mean, this is a huge event in our faith!! I think ecom should be more careful as to who is supplying their Bibles as clearly this edition has been edited."
__label__2,"20 minutes to warm up your day!: This is a great warm-up or a mini work out!Breathwork is a focus throughout, while upper and lower body are being worked at the same time, bringing balance to mind, body, and spirit.Whenever I am not feelng motivated I can pop in Zen Yoga Daily Warm-Up DVD, move along with Aaron's instruction, and I am ready to go!"
__label__2,"A Must Read!!: I am[...] and this book was compelling. A couple days ago I found some of my classmates reading this book. It looked interesting so, I picked it up at a local book store that day. After I got it I couldnt put it down!! I seriously have no words, I mean in some parts it made me tear up, in some parts I laughed....The biggest reason why I wanted to read this book at first was because my best friend was bulemic and now I understand a little better of what she went through by reading Isabelle and Ashley's struggle. This is a phenomenal book..A MUST READ...and Im sad that its over but I will definetely be reading it again. BUY THIS BOOK!!"
__label__1,"Cheap foam.: This seat is nothing more than low quality foam cut at an angle, but what did I expect for $14?I should have went with a higher quality one! I am just shocked at the great reviews, I have used mine for about a month now with no difference in my lower back and the cushion has really flattened a lot!!Hmm.. Sorry, but it didn't help me at all, if anything I feel worse off."
__label__1,Not very useful: My daughter begged for this forever and finally I got it for her. It's basically useless. Too small for most furniture (IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND ANY) and the shape makes it almost impossible to even fit what small amount came with it in it to play. VERY disappointing.
__label__2,"Very warm and durable sweatshirt.: Coming from a place where winters are pretty harsh I wanted something that was heavy and warm. This sweatshirt is super comfortable and warm. I have several of this style and wear them quite frequently around the house, etc. They have stood up to a lot of wear and tear, gone through the wash many times and are still holding up. Love them!The seller, South Horizon, is a very good seller to buy from. They are extremely reliable. I have made several purchases from them and have been compeltely satisfied with how they conduct business. I would highly recommend buying from them."
__label__1,"Great fragrance that won't last: This has been the only perfume I have purchased since my Senior Prom, more than 30 years ago. The fragrance is just terrific. Nothing compares to the fresh and sophisticated smell of it. Sadly the fragrance won't last. After using it couple of times the smell of Vetiver just vanishes and is quickly replaces by an alcoholized smell. So now I buy it for special occasions when I feel nostalgic about the brand new smell and it buy it in the smallest size possible. Sad that Guerlain has not improved the formula after so many years."
__label__1,Nice beginner book: This is a good primer for someone very new to the game. I would suggest Handicapping 101 by Brad Free as a better choice. I expected a bit better from Mr. Eng as he is certainly a respected and knowledgable handicapper. He may have been limited by the publisher.
__label__1,"WHAT'S THIS?: Got the movie as promised, but was not real impressed with it! Definitely not worth the money! A bunch of garbage thrown together from several seasons that didn't make no sense! One wasn't even Perry Mason it was Betty Davis.. four discs an the third one was a bunch of nothing interviews that I had no interest in. Take my word, save your money!"
__label__1,"Goldberg forgets his own bias: This book is about bias. In this case it's about Goldberg's bias after leaving CBS. This is a 'preaching to the choir' book. If you are conservative, you'll love this screed, if you are middle of the road to liberal you will be offended as the author intends. When liberal politics makes a comeback, expect Goldberg to flip flop once again and return to expousing liberal politics as he has for the majority of his career."
__label__2,"3 kids, no mess: I have no idea why I can't find this at Target, CVS or Walgreens anymore, so I'm forced to order it on ecom. Pump + 3 kids = no mess. Nuff said. Oh, and the toothpaste itself is just toothpaste. Nothing special. The five stars are for the design alone."
__label__1,does not work: the item was advertised that you could plug it into an electrical outlet and use it as a phone jack for your cable or satellite box. It does not receive a dial tone and did not come with any other receiver pieces. I am sorry that I purchased the product and am still paying an extra $5 a month to my satellite provider.
__label__1,"Way too expensive for what you get!: When I saw the price of this item, I mistakenly assumed that it must be of great quality and included the special size bowls. (I somehow missed the ""bowls not included"" in the description.) Suffice it to say that I was shocked when I opened the package. First, it looks like it was put together for maybe $5 and does not include anything but the metal stand. When I called to complain, the woman simply told me, ""Well, it's not made in China."" To be honest, for what I got, I would have rather it be made in China with the price cut that accompanies it. Finding bowls that fit the stand (which are oblong) is difficult unless you order the bowls from the manufacturer, which are again overpriced. I was very disappointed with the product, given the price I paid for it."
__label__1,"Does NOT Deal With All 5 Points!: Hunt and White battle it out over the first four points of Calvinism. When it comes to the fifth point (eternal security) there really isn't much either writes and that's because they both agree on eternal security. This book is very upsetting because it really is not debating the five points of Calvinism as the title would suggest, but only four points.While it is certainly true that White is a Calvinist, Hunt is not a true Arminian, since he too believes in eternal security. Both White and Hunt would say King David remained saved while in his adultery and murder, which is clearly unscriptural (Ezek. 33:18; Rom. 8:13; etc.). Because of their agreement on eternal security the Christian position on the fifth point was not declared in this book. Many readers are not even aware that it is possible that eternal security might be wrong. This book fails horribly when it comes to bringing out the Biblical position on the fifth and most important point of Calvinism."
__label__2,"good expectations: thoughtful and hypnotic tunes that create dreamy landscapes in the mind. Not every song moved me so strongly, however. I consider this one a good primer that lets us in on what this talented band is capable of. Enjoyable, Beatles' inspired pop that fits in nicely with Keane, The Shins et. al."
__label__2,"El CD está muy bueno: El CD está muy bueno pero como mencionaron arriba no tiene la mejor calidad.Y le dieron canciones solistas a Dominic que canta horrible,Gotay tampoco me gusta cantando...¿Donde queda Natalia que tiene una tremenda voz?,¿Dónde queda nuestra estrella y ganadora de la competencia Janina? Ella debió tener cancioens como solista pq cantaba muy lindo.Pero sabemos que Janina triunfará y llegará muy lejos.Si eres fan de Janina no olvides visitar la siguiente página: http://janina.vida787.com encontrarás fotos,eventos.noticias,messenger en la misma página, y mucho más registrate ya..."

__label__2,"This isnt a vent fest for the mars volta: I don't recall the cd saying ""the Mars Volta"" on it.But if it did please tell me because this does not sound anything like the mars volta to me.I must've been fooled!This album is by far my favorite Omar solo album. It has this very latin, heated, quick paced theme to it. There's hardly time for you to stop and think about it. Songs like Please Heat This Eventually and Boiling Death Requests a Body to Rest It's Head On are straight examples of what i'm talking about. There so enthusiastic with there playing. Everything sounds perfectly in it's rightful place (even if it really is all over at any given time). You'll feel so appreciative of this album, you'll wish you could go back in time and listen to it for the very first time again.I totally and completely wish i could.So give it your full attention.And dance! Because this album will make you want to dance!"
__label__2,"Great book for beginners!: I read this book last year when I became interested in Odinism/Asatru, and I found it to be an insightful and informative work, that features all aspects of the faith. Painstakingly researched and cleverly presented I would highly reccommend ""The Nature of Asatru"" by Mark Puryear to anyone interested in Odinism/Asatru, especially if they are new to the faith."
__label__1,"One of the Most Frustrating Games I've Ever Played: I too am a big fan of the Sims franchise, and had a blast playing the (highly addictive) Sims 2 for the DS. But I am ready to throw Castaway into the sea.While a cool concept and fun to get started on, it becomes very frustrating very quickly. I spend all my time now hunting one particular kind of fish so I can progress through the game. It's been three days and I still have not caught the stupid fish.I guess the game is still too new to have a helpful walkthrough online, but from what I've read in the forums there are a lot of people as frustrated as I am at other points in the game which makes me not very anxious to move forward anyway. There is something to be said for a challenge--but not to the point that it makes you become so frustrated you want to put down the game!"
__label__2,"time well spent: These mysteries are quite well written and well acted. The stories are involving and thought-provoking. I have the entire set and have watched several episodes many times. Each time I find something else to interest me. In addition, the setting of Midsomer townships are usually quite beautiful and pastoral and are a relief from the usual fare in American mysteries today. Also, there is less graphic violence in these. This does not in any way detract from the impact of the stories, but in fact adds to them. I would recommend them to anyone who likes a good mystery."
__label__2,"Calobo's Folk-Rock Live essence captured!: This album is excellent! Their studio albums are good, but they don't capture the liveliness, emotion and audience participation that this album does. Some of the best live music theyv'e ever done is on this album. The crystal ballroom in portland is not only their hometown, but a place where they are comfortable and familiar with the fans and the atmosphere. I can truly say that this shows in the music because I've been to one of the shows that appears on this album. The vocals and acoustic guitars are excellent. These guys are really up and coming and if you like bands like Phish, Dave Matthews band, Moe, Strangefolk, String Cheese Incident, etc. Then you'll love this band and this album."
__label__2,"Long winded but good: My 12 year old brother read this book (he loves to read Henty's works) and this is basically what he thought of it- ""Unlike other Henty books, this one had very long winded speeches that made it harder to keep my interest. But overall it was a good book."" Not one of his favorites, but still a good read."
__label__2,A good Book!!: I LIKED THIS BOOK. The only thing I didn't like was the character Isabella. She was rather annoying to me. Gwendolyn was a good character who finds out she really does have powers. Because she had different ways people ostracized her. I thought the other characters were a hoot especially Lachlan. All I can say is I enjoyed this book. The banter between the characters made it fun to read.
__label__2,"Exquisite! I love it!: Incredible venue; included my two favorite Il Divo selections; delightful interviews (at times hilarious), makes them seem like pretty humble guys considering their talent - an absolute treat!"
__label__2,"Love it!: I love this stroller. I run/walk with both my kids everyday and this stroller has been great. Like everyone else says, the only issue is the sun visor, but it doesn't seem to bother the kids so it's fine.The swivel wheel is great and I love the rollbar because I feel like it provides a little extra security when running hills."
__label__2,Black and Decker Lithium ion cordless screwdriver: The Black and decker lithium screwdriver is great for getting into places a larger cordless driver just can't reach. I used it to reverse the blades on my ceiling fan. A regular screwdriver would take too long and my old cordless screwdriver was too big to fit between the ceiling and the blades. This is a great tool for anyone. The battery life is better than many other comparable drivers out there.
__label__2,"A+ PLus product: This is my 3rd pair of these exact shoes. I know, I know. It is not normally my style to buy the same pair of shoes 3 times in a row, but these are great and feel very comfortable. I seem to be able to keep these clean and nice for a whole year. i am hard on shoes, these take a beating and stay looking nice with just a little TLC. Great product, thanks!"
__label__1,"Not all glass...several broke upon opening of package: I ordered two assortments of these glass beads. They are very pretty beads. BUT, at least 15 of the beads broke upon taking them from the packaging. Also, quite a few were not glass but were some sort of clay (fimo or other brand). If I wanted clay beads, I would have made them myself, at least they wouldn't have broken as easily. I wasted almost $40. All together, I ended up with maybe 10 usable beads out of the two orders."
__label__2,"Good action movie: If you like action well this film should be good. What we have here is an attempt to make a movie based on real social issues of child soldiers and the profits of diamonds used to fund dubious political movements.The story I found in many parts over the top. So they made a movie full of stock characters. Good moral reporters trying to help the locals for humanity sake, world officials' who are trying to do some good and not so bad mercenaries who look like they are modern cowboys finishing off with a Hollywood happy ending.Having said that some of the scenes for example when the rebels took the town, killed, cut peoples hands off and took many into slavery, I thought were good.The filming is good.The acting was nothing special. The casting was not good. DiCaprio should never have put in that role. It did not suit him."
__label__2,"sLIGHTLY UNHAPPY: I researched this item on the computer. I could not tell the exact shape of the earpieces. I like this headphone except for the ear cushion. It is too flat. If you tilt your head wrong the headphones fall off. ALSO, THEY ARE NOT REAL COMFORTABLE. iT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT WITH THE PADDED EARMUFF TYPE EAR PIECE. Although I like the quality of this product, I would not buy another until the earpiece is redesigned."
__label__2,"Great: I bought the cd for the Beethoven Quartet, but enjoyed listing to the others. The recording isn't the greatist, but still good. I think the last movement in the Beethoven quartet is played too slowly."
__label__2,"Beautiful movie-not for little ones: Oh how Disney movies have taken over our home! I love it. This one is so beautiful, great music, but the ending....oh that horrible sad ending. My 3yo little girl was CRYING at the end of this movie! She said, through her sniffles and tears ""She wants to be with her friend (fwawend)!"" IT was so sweet and very sad. We have never watched the movie again. Let me rephrase, she refuses to watch this movie or the 2nd one included. So I have no idea if there is a happy ending for this set of films.So... just a head's up to my fellow parents out there with young ones, this may be one you buy and put away till they are a little older than, uh, 3. But still a movie I recommend and love."
__label__2,"Good Product and Fantastic Customer Service: I ordered my Keurig B60 last November and used it regularly for several months. I then used it intermittently for a few months and then let it sit for a few months. The unit always worked flawlessly. I tried to use it 3 days ago and it didn't work. Uh, Oh. It was Saturday night about 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time and I called Keurig customer service. I didn't really expect a live body and hoped just to get a recording giving me the office hours. Instead, I got not one but two live bodies. They were very helpful and they walked me through some trouble shooting procedures with no luck. They then told me that they were sending me a new unit and that it should arrive in a few days. Sure enough, the unit arrived today, Tuesday. And, as they say in some of the scooter chair commercials, ""It did not cost me one cent, not one cent."" Can't ask for better service than that."
__label__1,"A Book with Some Gorey Details: Heart of a Jaguar book had an O.K. plot, and there were some good parts. However, the gorey parts made the whole book unenjoyable for me. Since many of them are not appropriate to discuss on the internet, I will not give examples - but they were disgusting. Occasionally the characters did inappropriate things, or used profane language. I know this was how people acted in Mayan days, but the discription of some things was a little bit much. So if you love reading about bloody and gorey things, you would enjoy this book."
__label__1,D.O.A.: Battery was new but transmitter sends no sinal on any freq. JUNK. Here are your extra few words fir this Dumb rewiew to go through.
__label__2,Excellent movie!: I really enjoyed this movie. The streaming reception was excellent. I have always been satisfied with the streaming movies that I order from ecom.
__label__1,A very boring book.: This is a very boring book. Nothing happened druing the first half of the book and even it started moving the story was flat. The plot was so sketchy that a lot of pages were filled with talks of visiting fast food and main character's love of fast food. This is terrible.
__label__2,"Logitech Keyboard: For around $30, I think it is pretty hard to find a nicer keyboard and mouse. Sure, there are nicer ones out there, but it is hard to beat in terms of quality for the price."
__label__1,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK: The book is horribly written. It has poor explanations of basic mechanical actions, let alone concepts. It is a waste of money. Microsoft's own study guide is far superior. The material is disjointed and incomplete. It's just a rotten, rotten book."
__label__2,Good product: I keep this on and use to seal around windows and doors or anywhere I find a slight draft. It goes on easy and cleans up easy.

__label__1,"This book is basic and lacks any intermediate techniques.: If you don't know how to kick and have never thrown before - this book is for you. If you are currently taking hapkido lessons, are beyond your first couple of belts and want to supplement your master's curriculum - I wouldn't reccomend this book. Mr Shaw makes some broad statements about the history of Hapkido which may not be supported by the entire Hapkido community. However, Mr Shaw provides a very knowledgeable account of Korean history and lots of clear photographs."
__label__2,Great for use with Pack n' Play for newborn: I ordered two of these mobiles to hang from the canopies of our newborn twins' Pack n' Play (Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Twins Bassinet). They are small in size and worked GREAT if you just use the mobile without the arm. I just connected the mobiles to single lot-o-links and hooked them to the center of the bassinet sunshades. They hang at a great height for the girls to focus on the shapes and I like the fact that the mobile is stationary so that it doesn't overstimulate them (they were preemies). I like that they have something to look at if they are lying awake for a while before drifting off to sleep.

__label__2,"the visionary sade: Sade's spittle and bile for polite society is never on better display than here. As he probably would have predicted, we've become worse and more hypocritical than ever before. Progress is a myth; we like to pretend we've become transgressive, but in fact we've only turned sex and violence into cartoons - in fact we're scandalized more than ever by the real. This is particularly true among the progressives, leftists, and liberal priests who like to walk around and prattle about liberty while being as oppressive as any regressive hypocrite - the difference is we, the left, have managed to push our fears underground, where they've grown uglier and larger than we can imagine.Sade would have loved to be alive today in our culture of prudery. If Sade were working today, there'd be some truly revolutionary art . . . not to take anything away from Justine or Philosophy in the Bedroom."
__label__1,"Unimpressive: I was underwhelmed by a book from which I great expectations. I was really looking forward to a fun romp along the lines of Ya-Ya Sisterhood, but it struck me instead as a self-serving ""coming out party"" for the author. Rather than eliciting laughs, a couple of chortles is all I could muster.We read this in a book club and all 5 members gave it a hearty ""thumbs down""."

Even a head shot with an M1 Garand does not drop the enemy, COME ON!!!! The enemy soldiers have superhuman reflexes and can duck as soon as you pull the trigger. This game is boring and you feel like you are fighting with a pea shooter for all damage you can do to your enemy. First person shooters need to find another war to fight, (Korea would be cool) We have won World War Two too many times now."
__label__2,"MacBook and AirPort Audio Has Never Been Better!: A great product for unleashing the high-quality optical audio present in Apple's MacBook and AirPort Extreme. It feels a little flimsy on a normal TOSLINK cable, but it is a necessary piece to any home theater that uses a Macintosh Computer for a Media Center."
__label__1,Not satisfied: I was very disappointed due to the fact that I was sent a cassette instead of a CD. I didn't go back and check who made the error but I guess easy come easy go. It would cost more to send it back then to keep it.I just won't be able to ever listen to it because I do not have a cassette player!

I expect a lot more from Chico, but he slipped with this project."
__label__1,"warped before I was able to use it: Upon receiving this organizer, I was first disappointed with the quality. The cover is a milky transparent plastic - similar to a tupperware container - more than a clear plastic which the pictures indicated it would be. I read the box instructions on cleaning - ""dishwasher safe, top drawer only."" Popped it in the dishwasher to clean, and when the cycle was complete I reassembled the box. The top cover was WARPED and now the box cannot seal properly, which is part of the reason why I bought this container. Seems to me like I have some pricey junk on my hands."
__label__1,"Great Game: This game had me laughing from the opening monologue to the last cut scene. The dialogue was outstanding. I enjoyed this game so much I can't wait for the sequel to come out. I will pre-order a copy a soon as it becomes available. It was rated Game of the Year and deserves that Award. With it's great graphics, story line, dialogue and various scenery, other games will have to go a long way to beat this one. If you liked Austin Powers and 007, you will love this game. It has a mixture of both incorporated in it's story line."

__label__2,"Relevant After 222 Years: If you look in the news on any given day you see discussions for down-sizing and decentralizing the federal government and transferring authority to the individual states. You can read the Federalist Papers and understand all the points of view about why our government was structured the way it is, and why Federalists (Hamilton & Jay) and Anti-Federalists (Madison) both supported the Constitution. This is an absolutely fascinating read, particularly in today's context regardless of your position, and a great piece of history."

We had two movie nights during the week and thinking the teachers can't, and shouldn't, choose a dumb movie, we expected something nice on the 2nd movie night. Guess what was waiting for us? Cabin Boy. It was the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Lame plot, if there was any, about some spoiled rich kid (""Fancy Lad"") named Nathaniel who's a total idiot trying to go back home with his ""adventures"" on the way. I, a person with no knowledge whatsoever in movie making, could just guess right away that the ""sea"" was pure swimming pool and that the ""ship"" was going nowhere. All the props were ""visible"" and worst of all, it was plain STUPID. Such a sad, horrible movie. An insult to the viewers."
__label__1,Slow read: I kept waiting for the action and it never happened. It was like reading a diary of a not very interesting person until the very end of the book where the hero finally did something himself.
__label__1,"Great photos, inane captions. Other books are better.: It's hard to look at these beautiful photographs and not read the captions, since the captions take up a whole page opposite the photo. I like both Don and Fred, think they're amusing fellows. I can't imagine why they didn't make the captions more entertaining or enlightening, instead of sophomoric or irrelevant. Who cares that Don went back to the truck for a pack of cigarettes while Fred took a photo? Does this enhance your enjoyment one iota? Bless the Wee One, this is a major disappointment. Almost but not quite worth it for the pictures, you won't want to leave this lying around on the coffee table when your in-laws or children are around. (Or anyone with an ounce of intelligence.) All the shilling in the world won't make this a memorable experience. Pick up another photographer's book and enjoy it more"
__label__1,"warning: I bought this for my wife so that she could use it overseas where there is 220v current. She does not like the curler because her fine hair slips through too easily and she can't roll her hair with it. I tried roughing the barrel with an emery board, but I am still disappointed. It might work better on coarser hair."
__label__2,Amazing: What a treat this book was to read. I was initially loaned this book to read by a friend of the author and have subsequently ordered the book for my sister and friends. The obstacles that she overcame and her growth spiritually are models for all of us to aspire to. Also appreciated her emphasis on the importance of sharing decisionmaking with her children and some examples of how she included them.

__label__2,"Smile...: With a few notable exceptions, Nevil Shute is the most optimistic author I have ever encountered. With a moral and physical compass, an engineer finds himself abandoning his quiet life for adventure. When I was younger, this character convinced my father that I should become an engineer.Give it a few pages, it starts a little slow.Light reading, because it feels good."
__label__1,"Loved this in the beginning, but...: The small metal teeth that cut the vegetables are coming out of the plastic that holds them in place. I am so glad that I saw them before I ate them!--they could have really torn up my insides. I am not sure if I got a faulty one, or if others have experienced the same thing... I am afraid to use it now..."
__label__1,"Looks Dont Count In Music: Only 2 songs are good on this cd....Sometimes and Going Crazy. All the other are really..well..not my type. Her voice, in my opinion, sounds like a chipmunk with a backache! I dont really think that reviews that rate her body are appropriate because THIS ISNT A ""LOOK"" REVIEW, ITS MUSIC. If u like Britt though, cool. We all need a variety of likes and dislikes."
__label__1,Leather finished on only one side - sandpaper grip: I ordered this leash due to positive feedback about the item. Unfortunately the leather is only finished on one side which makes the other side feel like sandpaper. The inside of the handle also isn't finished making this uncomfortable to hold. When I needed to temporarily shorten up the lead by sliding it through my other hand it was very uncomfortable. I also doubt the longevity of this product due to being only finished on one side. It would more easily soak up moisture.If you wear gloves or don't mind a rough feeling leash then this will work for you. It is very thick leather with what appears to be a sturdy clasp.I returned this item after our first walk today.** Not sure if the other reviewer got the same leash I did because this is not soft in any sense of the word. **
__label__1,Didn't work: Bought this to transfer i-pod tunes to new computer..however it didnt work and the patch didn't work either
__label__2,"the best dreamworks movie EVER!: Sometimes Dreamworks does, well, bad. This movie is the complete opposite!Shrek had lots of gross lines and moments, but Over the Hedge is completely different! I would tell everyone to see this movie! It's awesome!!!"
__label__1,"I found it ok but boring!: The book had lots of dialogue that to me was boring. It did take me two days to finish the book because I wanted to know how the story ended. I did find myself skipping quite a bit. In all fairness I'm not a western book fan, but some I've found amazing like Johanna lindsey's ""A heart so wild"" and ""All I need is you"".This story was ok, just the dialogue was boring and there was no chemistry between the characters! it was adventurist with a mysterious plot."
__label__1,"Doug Liman's commentary put me to sleep: I love love love this movie so I bought the ""unrated"" disc as I thought it would give me some interesting insight into the actors and the film, etc. I was so sadly disappointed! If you put the director's commentary on as your watching the film, you will literally fall asleep, he is so incredibly boring. I thought directors are great storytellers, but man, is he a drip! I could not sit through it!! Doesn't anybody look at this stuff before it's sold to the masses?!? So I turned the commentary off and watched the same dvd I could've rented from netflix. Not fair for 20 bucks!"
__label__2,"When rap was king: I'll keep this short and sweet. ""Verbal Intercourse"" is the greatest rap beat of all time. I know it's not the most heard or popular but I know what I'm talking about. For those who don't get it, hopefully you'll get it soon. For those who do, more power to you. That beat is sick in countless ways. RZA was and will always be the best producer in history, '93-'97 will never be matched. Its all been downhill since. You all just have to trust me. I truly have the ear."
__label__2,Buy it--: I really like the Stephanie Plum series and decided to start at the beginning. There is actually a different reader on One for the Money than on some of the later books I have listened to but both readers have been great. Fun books and I would recommend this to anyone--funny as well as a bit of a mystery.
__label__1,"Content Management System? Are you sure?: ""Building A Content management System"" is a misleading title The example is oversimplified in regards to name, and it is like any sample application that anyone who knows to create tables and knows how to create asp.net pages can think and produce. If you want to learn ASP.NET this book is not that great there are better ones in the market. If you want to learn content management systems and implement one this example is oversimplified and it does not lead you for building a real systemSo i personally suggest keeping your money for a good book on ASP.NET or Content Management System"
__label__1,"Not good at all: Bought one last year and was able to use for only 2 weeks. Now it plays (both ordinary cd audio and mp3's) sometimes but most of the time it will not recognize the cd at all. The player did not undergo any rough handling or anything. If all the reviews about how good this product is true, then I guess I'm just unlucky."
__label__1,"Bad idea, poorly executed.: A depressing story without a point. A painful and stereotypical depiction of life in South Central Los Angeles. Thoroughly amateurish cinematic technique. Makes one wonder how the investors were so completely fleeced into giving the filmmakers money to make this turkey. I know, I was there."
__label__1,"Flimsy construction: I liked the unique design of this birdbath, but was very disappointed when it arrived. The finish on the copper was uneven and bumpy. Even worse, the birdbath is constructed of extremely lightweight materials making it impossible to fill with water and not have it tip over on anything but the most level surface. I wouldn't advise this as a purchase for anyone's garden space where it is to rest on grass, soil or rocks. It would also be a poor choice for use around curious kids who could easily tip it over."
__label__2,"Good mystery: I like Lisa Gardner. She teases, leads you on, and entertains with her stories. Lisa sprinkles a sarcastic wit throughout her text which I enjoy. Definitely a guilty pleasure."
__label__1,"TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH: I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest."
__label__1,"this went back: What wasn't clear to me (although may be to others) was the printing of ""Ford Racing"" on the side of the cover is on the actual cover and not just part of the packaging. I thought the cover was just plain black which it wasn't. I didn't care for this and sent it back."
__label__2,"YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE (unless you don't buy it!): This two disc set is truly unbelievable. If you want the best of Brown in the '70s on one album, look no further."
__label__2,"Great book re Buddha: Communicates Buddha's life experiences and core teachings in a compelling story format. Engaging and memorable. Definitely helped me increase the ""mindfulness"" in my own life."
__label__1,"A lot of issues.: Battery issues, issues with the brake and engine cut off.While my son loves this bike when it works, which is pretty rare. We also own the Razor quad, and have had relatively no issues with it."
__label__2,"The First Woman Doctor: The First Woman DoctorI have chosen this book because I¡m interested in the medical field. Also I really like books that deal with medical stuff. This book has ü pages in the whole book. The book has no table of contents, glossary, or index. This book has ú Chapters. This book is about an average girl¡s life as she grows up in the states. The only deference is that she becomes the first woman doctor and she is poor. She used to have nice home but she moved because her father lost his job. Her number ü priority is to get accepted into medical school so she can help her family earn extra money to support the house hold. This book is about her life her finical and time management problems go about. Watch her adventure of life unfold."
__label__2,"Good, but not my style.: Has good solid information. Sass does not pre-soak legumes before cooking so all the cook times are wrong for me. I always soak legumes at least 24 hrs. This starts the germination process and converts the starch so no gas after eating legumes.Other popular pressure cook book recos. at least 4 hr. presoak so cook times work for my style. Both books are good. Just depends on your preference."
__label__1,"this recording stinks (should be a 'zero' stars rating): oh you've heard it all if you've read the reviews here - ""progressive rock"" ""jazzy"" ""obscure"" and even ""one of the best prog.rock albums"" - please - gimme a break - hey - i *love* yes & floyd & elp & the nice & ozric tentacles & the enid & a slew of other prog.rock bands - but this recording ""third"" by soft machine is something to avoid - it has no direction & meanders through some very odd sounds (king crimson made it work - these guys fall shy of the mark each time) and will bore the bejeepers out of you - save your money & buy a six-packi'm certain this review will peeve many a reader who ""just *love* this band"" - but if you're not familiar with them - thank your lucky stars & avoid this disc - it stinksspace puppy - out"

__label__2,"Tasty Granola Bars - Recommended: These Nature Valley ""Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars, Peanut"" are very good tasting and make a great between meal snack. We have been trying to get my kids to eat healthier and these are certainly better than candy bars but the real test is if my kids will eat them, and they really enjoy them. Being a Type 2 diabetic I am fairly careful choosing snacks and these are at the upper end of what I feel safe eating with 170 Calories and 17g Net Carbs (11g of sugar).My only issue is that the layer of peanut butter on the bottom can be messy in warmer weather or if heated up by holding in the hand too long.Recommended!CFH"
__label__1,"Incorrect item sent...: Ordered DVD+R discs but DVD-R discs were sent instead. Contacted seller, stated Fed-Ex would email return label to return item. Correct item could not be sent out until the incorrect item was rec'd by seller. Have not received any email or return label from Fed-Ex or seller. Poor customer service and will not order from again from seller."
__label__1,"OK: All Stephanie books are great. I have read about 90% of the rest and they are just not the same standard. Janet has come a long way since she wrote these early books. Early versions of Stephanie's grandmother are well developed, but I have been disappointed by other aspect - plots, plausability, quality of romance. She does still manage to capture the cities and the people who live in them"
__label__2,"One Of The Best: This is one of Ashford and Simpson's best albums. It has everything; great music, meaningful lyrics, music with a beat, and ballads. ""Make It To The Sky"" is one of my favorites. It sometimes brought tears to my eyes, describing so well how I felt. Every song on this album is great, and no Ashford and Simpson fan should be without it."
__label__2,"KICKSTAND IS GREAT!!!!!: When building an electric bicycle we needed a substantial kickstand -- this fit the bill nicely.about 50 pounds in batteries, before we climb on - so it does have a lot of weight to hold securely, and does it well."
__label__2,"The best Bare Naked cd of them all: The cd shows a wide range of the band's musical talents. One Week is a great song to listen to over and over. Some Fantastic resembles Million Dollars with its clever lyrics and by the way Ed and Steve play off of each other. Other songs like I'll Be That Girl, Alcohol, and In the Car are easy to sing along with. Never is Enough may be the best song on the album because of the pure happiness it exhibits and the easy going rhythm of the song. This edges out over Gordon and Rock Spectacle as the best cd they have put out."
__label__2,Fantastic!: I was weary of ordering Baklava on the internet but this arrived and was absolutely delicious. Ordering another batch right now!
__label__1,"Don't be fooled! Bernie Mac does is not present in this video.: Bernie Mac is not present in this video in no way, shape, or form. Unless there is some unknown actor who happens to be in this video who is also named Bernie Mac, then don't look for the ACTOR Bernie Mac. While the video does show some interesting steps, by various instructors, I would not recommend it for ""learning"" how to step with a partner. Most of the instructions shown does not show ""techniques"" (i.e. turning, spinning, etc) and its designed for just SEEING various steps. Unless you plan on ""steppin"" in the same spot I would look somewhere else for learning how to ""couple dance"". There are even some parts of the video that just repeats itself within the DVD."
__label__2,"5 stars for the cover alone: this cd has really good cover artwork.there are ghostly images and organic looking folk all gathered around a crooked ancient old tree.before even one note of this album has arrived to my ears, i am hearing a forbidden song."
__label__1,"A decent...albeit real basic book: As a beginners book it wasn't bad, but I was expecting something new or more advanced that I've read in better books previously.AdvancedMacking.Com and How to be the jerk that women loveare much better books than this one."
__label__1,disappointing: This cover is NOT red. Garnet or a light burgandy.Have already donated it to Goodwill.
__label__1,"This book is a loser: When will James Patterson learn that he has been writing too much, dull, boring and well, just losing material?I respect Alex Cross too much to believe in the claptrap.Spare me world terrorist plots.Write what you and Alex know, good cop crime novels, with maybe a little fantasy like Max, remember the flying girl?Gave me chills until the end grossed me out.(The Lake House). I will not pick up another Patterson novel until he changes his ways.Yo, James, my man, you must be rich enough. Take a rest, You need one, or you will lose your readers (me)"
__label__1,"One extra star for talent?: I consider myself a huge progressive rock fan but I think this cd is awful. The vocalist can't sing and all the time signature changes make for a complicated mess. There definitely are some talented musicians on this cd and I think if they stuffed a sock in the vocalist's mouth, it might make an interesting jazz cd....but then I don't really like jazz. Anybody want to buy a slightly used cd?"
__label__2,"Review: The Guide is excellent. It's an invaluable tool for becoming more effective during initial interactions with girls. The book provides good, simple techniques for overcoming social anxiety and specific advice for meeting and dating women. It is clearly written, lively, and very enjoyable to read."
__label__2,"The Prayer Book Office - Howard Galley: This is a wonderful resource for those who wish to say the Daily Office from an Anglo-catholic tradition. Sadly it is out of print and virtually impossible to come by. The copies I have seen run around $250 which is a little more than I paid for mine back in the 70s ($39.99 as I recall) If you do find one, SNAP IT UP. About 6 inches by 9 inches, the book is about an inch thick, making it the size of many Episcopal Prayer Books. Each of the Psalms includes an appropriate antiphon. In addition to the Collects for Sunday, there are Collects for the Saints as well as Major and Minor Feasts. I wish mine had held up better, but I got a lot of years use out of it."
__label__1,Only good use of the book is the practice test at the end: Bought this book for additional preparation for the SQL and PL/SQL exam after reading the first 5 chapters of OCP:Application Developer (this book covers material for all the exams required for OCP-Application Developer). The only practical use I was able to get from the exam cram book was the practice exam at the end. scored an 83. This book is a waste of maney.
__label__1,"Do not get this: Okay, I am a Bratz and My Scene dolls, but I got this doll and Barbie three weeks ago, and they were useless. I mean everytime I brushed Barbie's hair, her hair keeps falling off, and she is almost bald now, and her clothes keep tearing. And the Madison doll, all i did was brush her hair gently and her head came off, for no reason. And her dress ripped in half, no reason again. But, last week I got a rock angelz Jade and Sasha, and they were awsome, their clothes never ripped, their head stay on, and theyir hair never fell out. and they come with funner stuff. So don't get this doll. Get a Rock Angelz doll instead."
__label__2,"Does what it says: I am a single person and I didnt want to try to heat the whole house if I am in just one room. I have had the unit for a few days and it works great. Like others say you have to be pretty close to feel the direct heat but I use it in my bedroom at night and it keeps most of the room a few degrees warmer then the rest of the house. I checked my electric usage and I have already used 30 less killowats in one day of use. It does feel a little cheap, so we will see how long it last."
__label__1,"Lousy jacket...save your money...: I bought one of these jackets on a lark. After all, it's a Rockport brand jacket (not that they're known for jackets, but the name stands for a certain level of quality), and the price is oh-so-right.But the jacket is oh-so-wrong. The leather itself is buttery soft and nice enough. But the cut is really bad. The jacket is wide and very short. I'm not sure what male body type that flatters, but I know it's not mine. The jacket is also extremely thin/light. When I got the box in the mail, I wondered what it could be, because the box was too light to possibly be a leather jacket. Guess again...I have purchased a LOT of stuff from ecom over the years, and this is the first item I'm returning because, frankly, it stinks..."
__label__1,"Don't waste your time: This book was terrible. I did not enjoy reading it at all. The hero was not at all appealing except maybe in looks and his kidnapping of the heroine was just too much. I don't see how it is possible that lust can turn into love when your feelings are so set against someone you hate. Albeit these two emotions are extremes of each other and some people will likely see the similarity between the symptoms of the two. Usually, JL writes wonderful books, but this one is certainly not her best."
__label__2,"Great book!: This book is hysterical! I buy it for all of my friends that are first time moms! The author is a comedian, so you know it will be funny. Great gift for first pregnancy. She also has another book, Naptime is the new happy hour. Also very funny."
__label__2,Good compact verson of the Powers books: Walter Wink has the foundation of nonviolence down and really explains very clearly just what we are up against. I have seen him quoted for years and with Kindle had the chance to read all his books. This a good summary. If you are a scholar or someone who wants all the background read the trilogy of the Powers. Mary
__label__2,"More Parables from the Back Side: We used it as a teaching tools for adults at church. Very helpful, we really enjoyed reading through it and very helpful in thinking about the parables."
__label__1,"Terrible transfer - product should be dropped: The film is a low budget production, but about what you would expect... I wasn't particularly impressed with the script or the production values, but overall, acceptable. The problem is the DVD transfer. It may be the worst I have ever seen. Reel changes remain visible, the color is washed out, and the audio becomes garbled to the point where one can barely follow the plot in the last scenes of the film. ecom should drop this product until the distributors remaster the DVD."
__label__1,"Not better than my GeForce 3 Ti 200: I bought this card hoping to extend the life of my Dell Dimension 8100, by replacing my GeForce 3 Ti 200 video card.Although the installation went flawlessly, the performance of the new card lagged behind enough that I went back to my original card.Frame rates are significantly lower and it benchmarked well less as well.I'm not inmpressed."
__label__2,Another Great pair.: Another great pair of shoes. Same seller as before. Arrived on time and fit great. Love them. Very comfortable. I recomend this shoe to all who love a casual shoe.
__label__1,"I wasted my money on THIS???!!!: I will admit right off of the bat that I bought this book without looking into it, after it was suggested as a book you should read if you enjoyed a certain other Survivalist novel that I had recently read. I didn't even bother to read much about it & just bought it. I can not believe that I paid $ for this book!!! The worst part of it, IMO, is that the writer of this book calls himself a Christian. As an Anabaptist, I found the mindset in this book very unsettling."
__label__1,terrible quality: This copy is like an old VHS recorded from an old 8mm. Terrible quality. Never should be edited like this.
__label__2,"Good Memories: ""Get Down Tonight"" features a one-night reunion of hot disco acts from the 70's. Although the artists work in a medium that prizes youth but tends to take a lot out people over time, the singers and musicians have fun and every one of them delivers a fun performance on this DVD. Would like to have seen Donna Summer be part of the show, but her video at the end is enjoyable."
__label__2,Everyday Creative: 30 Ways to Wake Up Your Inner Artist: I really liked the cards. I teach a class in creativity and I was able to give them to individual students to encourage their creative growth.
__label__2,"This movie is a slap to your face: This movie documents how the Israel-Palestine conflict get people to be so extremely activists, risking their lives in order to say their words. This movie is a slap to your face, especially if you are Israeli."
__label__1,"(5 stars) Harwood's 'The Ghost Writer' debut novel should be applauded: From the moment I stepped into Gerard Freeman's world I was mesmerised. I happened upon John Harwood's debut novel in a small book store by the beach two days ago. Since this time I have spent my time engrossed in a tale that hauntingly evoked a mixture of emotions. I agree, with some reviews, that the last five pages of the book some how let down the incredible complexity of the story line; whilst strongly disagreeing with others who describe the story line as ""predictable"". I highly recommend 'The Ghost Writer'to all readers who enjoy a good supernatural suspense/thriller."
__label__1,"Out of date: The 18th edition is hopelessly out of date. I bought it because I saw it shrink wrapped, behind the counter at B&N;, so I assumed it was current. After copying addresses from this book and sending headshots and résumés out to over 100 talent agents and casting directors for my client, more than 20% of them (so far) have come back as undeliverable, addressee unknown. Yup, I checked the returned ones for typos.Don't waste your money. Breakdown Services sells guides and address labels and guarantees they're up to date. I didn't think they'd be worth the money, but they are. (No, I don't work for BDS.)Also, the text of this book is available online if you search. No idea why -- maybe they're not publishing another edition.Best of luck in Los Angeles!"
__label__2,"latches board: This is a great learning and fun toy, but some of the latches are stiff, and they are hard to move even for an adult."
__label__1,"author is capable of much better than this: I have read a number of Linda Howard books and waited impatiently for the publication of this one. What a disappointment! The characters and plot were very underdeveloped and the book, in general, was boring. Linda Howard is an excellent author and is capable of much better works than this book. Linda, please write us a worthy successor to ""Son of the Morning"" and ""Dream Man""!!"
__label__1,"A very local geology: I can understand that the two five star reviewers are both residents of San Diego, because they're the only people this book is addressed to. The actual geological story is thin and fragmented. Amazingly there is almost no references to the plate techtonic events that created California. There are no maps to direct you to the sites the author describes, making them almost impossible for a visitor to find.If you (as I) don't live in or near San Diego, this book is, at best, mildly interesting."
__label__1,".0 Stars would be better!: This game was the absolute worst game ever invented for any game system! You run around this teeny tiny park in a small circle crashing into walls and getting stuck in corners while listening to the repetitive annoying sound of your player saying ""Hehehe"" (or if you're playing as Phil, ""This is even better than eating boogers!""). You could play it for the rest of your life and never beat it. There's a million things you have to do but you never know what they are because there's no way of checking your progress. Plus, even though the park is tiny, you're constantly getting turned around and lost! Even the two-player mode is annoying because it's just as hard but shorter, unless you're playing mini golf, which takes about two hours and that's if you're an experienced gamer! The graphics are terrible and the sound is REALLY annoying. I wanted to turn the sound off after two minutes of gameplay. Word of advice: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY RENTING OR BUYING THIS GAME..."
__label__1,WASTE WASTE WASTE: All I reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money. DONT BOTHER!
__label__2,First Season: I was so impressed with this product! The box is completely like new and the bonus papers are still in their slot!
__label__1,"Extremely Boring: I enjoy the historical stories written by Ms. Cameron. I have read the other books in this series and have enjoyed them. Needless to say I could not wait for the next installement to see what will happen to the other residents of the building. Well, I have been extremely disappointed in this book. The characters are tiresome and silly. I am used to some miscommunication between chacters but this book takes the cake. I have never been more conscious of hardly ever leaving the location that takes place in this book. I know it's titled 7B but you wish that the chacters would go somewhere of interest because you go stir crazy in that house. I love to read and practically gobble up books, but this one, I found very difficult to finish. I read it when I was desperate for something and in between books. This was a poorly developed plot and I am disappointed in the main characters. I hope the series is finished and that the next book is better written."
__label__2,"Another fun Nancy Drew Game!!!: This game is so fun! For those of you who have played Nancy Drew games, you know that these games always combine a perfect amount of suspense, puzzle solving, thinking, and fun! These games make you want to keep playing, to see what will happen next! This game is no different.The game starts out as you, Nancy, are going with your friend, Maya, to do an interview. Maya goes in, and you are outside the door. All of a sudden, you hear a scream! This is when Nancy starts to investigate.Nancy needs to search for clues, talk to people, and even make a few phone calls. This game is so fun and interactive. For those of you having trouble figuring out what happens next, you can look up hints on the web. And don't worry, you'll still feel good when you have figured out the mystery.The games are a great compliment to the books, making you feel as though you really were Nancy Drew!!! If you like the books, I recommend the games, and this one is one of my favorites!"
__label__1,Only for Absolute Beginners: This books is only for absolute beginners. I picked it up just after learning the moves. It's useful in helping to see some very simple back row mates delivered by either the Queen or Rook. But that's it. That's pretty much what the whole book is about. This was probably the least useful chess book I've ever read.
__label__2,"You need at leat two!: One at home (comes with the iPaq) and one more for the office. Unfortunately, you'll also need to buy another AC adapter, or a car adapter (you can be stylin' with your car cradle) if you want to charge the thing. Only 4 stars"
__label__2,By far my favourite Russian grammar book!: I bought this on impulse when I was in Boston and I can certainly say I don't regret that decision! This is so too the point and manages to explain complicated grammar terms without over complicating things. I'm studying Russian in university and I always use this book to better explain to me things I didn't quite get. Definitely recommend it as a review or a brush up on Russian grammar.
__label__1,Do it yourself lie!: I purchased this product on the assumption that it was a do-it-yourself product but there is nothing do-it-yourself about it. You have to pay for the lab test to be done and pay for the postage to the USA. Not much good to me in new Zealand - I should have just paid for the test to be carried out in a lab here in the first place!!
__label__1,"A Good Book For Paranoid Psychoes: The long and the short of it: This book is certainly novel, but ultimately disgusting and unfortunately written by a nutcase.If you really want to get inside the messed up psyche of the laughably paranoid Neo-Nazi movement, read it. If not, it really has no other value."
__label__2,"Beauty and Feeling: This album swings from fairly conventional Nashville country, on ""I Love It When She Lies,"" to the bluesy shuffle of ""Green Eyed Girl,"" to folk rock grandeur on ""No Higher Ground."" And it vacillates through this range with panache and spirit. In a music world where mainstream music sets the expectations way too low, Greg Trooper is a smart, artistically ambitious troubadour. I wish we had more recording artists like him."
__label__1,Extremely Late: I ordered the book on Jan 5th for school but did not receive it until Feb 1st. I'm not sure what happened but the sellers were very kind and responsible about it. The book was also in very good condition.
__label__2,"Sony HT-6800DP 5-Disc Progressive Scan Home Theater System: Very economical and a good value for the price. Assembly is simple, and instructions cover the basics. Too bad my ex-wife took the system with her when she left."

The camera won't do that pre-flash business with an external flash, yet it's a fully sychronized flash just like in the good 'ole 35mm days.After trying to get the MS-1 to work for about an hour, even trying the ""*"" button, I hit upon this, got my old strobe out of my camera case, and the MS-1 works fine!"

THAT was when i missed the 'kidz' singing.I bought the cd, listened to it, and returned it. The songs are great, but the 'kidz' are BBBBBBBAAAAADDDD. They totally [destroyed] the songs! You could buy this cd but it's a waste of money.C'mon. I have an older sister and she keeps me up-to-date. She says the 'kidz' singing [is lame] and I agree."

My only regret is that I did not use this purchase until after my return date refund policy, this DVD SUCKS BIG time, please DO NOT WASTE your money on this piece of CRAP"
__label__2,"inexplicably good: I'm afraid this is one of those films that you just have to see. No attempt at paraphrase or rhetoric can add to what's already there on the screen. You might want to talk about the technical features, the lack of music, the point of view shots in the car, the beautifully desolate views of the hills around Tehran,the ambiguity of the ending - it's all just noise in my opinion. This film (like any other of true quality) is not what people say about it. It's to be experienced. You have a feeling of being taken somewhere else for 95 minutes, even though the realist feel should rightfully keep you grounded - somehow it has an element which uplifts you. I was extremely happy and alive for the rest of the day after seeing this - perhaps surprising considering the subject matter. I don't know anything about Mr Kiarostami (aside from his reputation) or the actors involved, but I am so glad I watched this film and look forward eagerly to see another of his."

__label__2,"Some Reviewers Exaggerate: I've seen both movies and do not agree that the movie is ""shaking"". The movie's style is done in a ture to life style that reflects the energy of the time and place. The special effects are better than the first movie. One in particular is when a speeding bullet flying toward the screen. I have seen many directors try this effect before and Director, James Dodson gets it right.This is the first time I have ever felt that a bullet fired was really going to get ME. I kid you not - right between the eyes! No 3-D effect ever matched this shot in it's intensity.Simply unbeleiveable!For all of you out there please consider that this movie had a 3 million budget not 10 million like the first. ""A list"" actors were used in the first, as opposed to lessor well known in the second. BEL2 had only a three million budget AND had a better effect and a better story line!Don't be fooled by some reviewers here that exaggerate and can't see past the first movie-"
__label__2,Best Chili Period - from a Chili Expert!: I am a very picky chili eater and I love this chili! I eat it a lot and it's very flavorful. The spiciness adds a great kick and it's organic so I can't say anything bad about it at all. I've tried others and they don't compare - they are mushy or too bland. This is really good - trust me!
__label__1,"What happened to emails from 1998???: I'm not saying I believe in Titor and i'm not saying I dont but I am curious to know about the emails John was alledged to have sent to people he spoke with on the forums in 2000/2001 in 1998 when he travelled back. Wasnt it something like that he took the names, email addresses and a message of some sort from people in 2001, then when he travelled back to 1998 he would send the emails to the people. So effectively they would recieve an email from themselves 3 years in the future???Can anyone verify this one way or another??"

__label__2,"Winning!: Okay, this is not Kenneth Brannagh's Henry V. But I was most pleasantly surprised to find that this made sense out of a tricky Shakespeare play and that it did not wallow in the gross-out depths that teen flicks so often wallow in. In fact, it floated, with buoyant dialogue, gleeful mischief, stunning location shooting in the Puget Sound area, nicely paced direction and editing, and solid performances by a young cast. While portraying affluent suburban white teens, it also drops a wry comment on the popular Dawson Creek/media representation of the generation. This not only entertains, it could get teens and adults talking about filmmaking, Shakespeare, love, music and other things that matter in a positive way."
__label__1,"Do Not Waste Your Money!: I have been waxing my bikini area myself at home for years. I always like to try new products and should have listened to the negative reviews. I know what I am doing when it comes to waxing myself, and I could not get these strips to work! No matter how quickly I tried to pull up the strip, it just left a goopy mess in my hair. Maybe one or two hairs came out with each pull. I can take the normal pain, but these actually bruised me so badly because the wax just stuck to my skin too much and not my hair. I wonder if there is a bad batch or something since some people have had the same problem? Very disappointing waste of time, money, and too painful."
__label__1,YAWN!!!!!: IT IS THE MOST BORING GAME EVER!!!

__label__1,"Why don't Catholics have impeccably bound Bibles?: Sure, they fixed the spelling errors and moved the notes to the same page. All of the glowing praise for this run of the mill Nelson produced bible just goes to show that Catholics have no appreciation for wrapping the Word of God in the finest materials. The nicest bibles in the world are bound by R.A Allen [...] and Cambridge Press. I have yet to find a Catholic bible that has a concordance. It is a good thing that Catholics do not reverence the Eucharist as they do bibles otherwise they would be celebrating the Mass with paper plates and Dixie cups rather than a gold chalice and paten, etc. To get a fine bible, you have to buy a Protestant bible, its a shame."
__label__1,"Very Happy Before, Very Unhappy Now: I used this scale for the past couple of years and had no problems, but now I am having the CAL problem described elsewhere. I tried the taped dime suggested here but that makes no difference. The scale displays the test of the LCD, then CAL. After a little while CAL fades out. This unit sat by itself on a shelf with no mistreatment. I admit that I haven't called the manufacturer, but based on the other comments, I see no need to add to my frustration."
__label__2,Great stretch: Love this! I find stretching videos very boring but not this one. This really makes you feel good after you use it. It's just the right length about 35 min.'s long. I don't like to do anything for a long time. This is easy and simple but good stetches.

__label__2,"Wonderful family film!: This movie is excellent, and very moving, a must see for the whole family. The subject matter is still very relevent today. Erik Estrada is outstanding in his role, as is Pat Boone. Covering the subject of gangs and religion is not easy to do well, but this movie manages to do it."
__label__1,"This is not good.: Well, This phones works fine. The only problem is that there is no way to set the sound volume correctly. If you put it high it is to high or low it is to low. It just does not sound right at all. You have to strain to hear. It is too hard to hear. The distance will not beat my 25 channel phone 20 years old. Well, Anything is better than this. The only good sound 2.4 Gz I have seen is the G.E. Expensive 900dss are ok. What we need is to get Sanyo back in the U.S. not this phone."

__label__1,"Below Binchy's Best: I eagerly looked forward to this book - I'm a true Binchy fan - and I was disappointed. While the setting is intriguing and her warmth is there, the characters are boring and one-dimensional, and the story is so plodding and predictable it is unbelievable - I kept reading it, expecting one of the famous Binchy twists, but it never came. I kept wondering where her startling insights into characters had gone - these were stock characters, with none of the unique and human foibles that make most of her characters so memorable and alive.If you are not a Binchy fan, please don't judge her books by this one - read London Transports, Next Year It Will Be Different, Circle of Friends, Dublin Tales, etc. Those are all wonderful, and show why she is so beloved by readers."
__label__2,"an effective reaction: This book is written in reaction to the tendency of neo-scholastic thinkers to neglect the role of the figure of Christ in the thought of Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and other Dominican thinkers. To redress this imbalance, Emery and Wawrykow have done an excellent job of compiling essays to address the long-neglected depictions of Christ in the writings and art of the medieval Dominicans through a multidisciplinary approach."

__label__1,"Big Disappointment: I hate to say this because I think Malcolm Bilson is an excellent pianist and I thoroughly enjoy and recommend his recording of the Mozart concertos with John Eliot Gardiner, but this CD was a big disappointment. Not because of Bilson's playing (which is very good) but for the awful recording quality of the CD. Sounds like they put the piano in a public restroom to record some of these sonatas. It has a very harsh ""small room"" reverberation that is very unappealing and uncomplimentary to the fortepiano (or any instrument!). Bilson deserves better enginneering than this. This would be a good CD if it were better recorded. Bilson's performance is fine , but the recording quality is unbearable. I recommend Melvyn Tan if you are looking for a good recording and performance of Beethoven sonatas on fortepiano."
__label__1,"Mostly for Karajan fans: You can argue that the brass in the Karajan-era Berlin Philharmonic were weak and nasal-sounding, but you can't dispute the sumptuousness and precision of the strings. And despite the typically dry and synthetic-sounding production from DG circa 1981, sumptuousness is what we get in both of these well-known works for string orchestra. But is it really appropriate to the music? For me, a smaller and more nimble body of strings, with a conductor less committed to legato phrasing and more attuned to the niceties of each score, serves these Dvorak and Tchaikovsky pieces better. But if deep-pile opulence is your priority--as it was Karajan's--then step right up."
__label__2,"Humor and Grooooove: How could anyone not appreciate an intelligent band with a sense of humor and can be groovin' all at the same time? Admittedly, the most irresistibly likable songs are the first 5, but the entire album/cd provides good music and demonstrates that this is a group of musicians that are capable and innovative. Basehead ladies and gentlemen, Basehead."

You can go online with this in a manner similar to Webkinz but only on the Russ website. Cute unicorn, but not the one that my daughter had requested. I have also had difficulty returning to ecom because although they managed to send me this request for a review, they don't seem to be able to find a record of my purchase so I can return it. Sign me very disappointed in ecom for this one!"
__label__1,"Dance your way bored.: I thought that this would be a good way to get into shape, but I couldn't be more wrong. It is very slow paced, and when you are trying to follow along, they switch moves before telling you what they're doing, so you can't really follow. I would not recommend this tape to anyone."

__label__2,"Excellent, a great buy for the beginner: In New York Finnish language courses are hard to come by. I have been trying to teach myself to read, speak and hopefully write Finnish for years so I could speak with my cousins and grandmother overseas. It was a daunting task because books left me uninspired and tapes just don't work for me. Finally as a last ditch effort I took a chance on this program. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the program actually makes the process of learning language fun. The program and quizzes are colorful and engaging and manage to combine, listening, reading, understanding and speaking into one fun exercise. I have progressed with this program 100% faster than with the methods I've tried before. I definitely recommend this program to anyone who would like to start learning Finnish.For those who are a bit more advanced or are anxious to get to the next level the Intermediate level for this program is World Talk Finnish."
__label__2,"IE DOM Explained: There are many books on the market that explain XML and what it is and does. This book explains the Microsoft IE DOM, and how to use it in the client. Since Netscape does not support XML, don't look for many examples of how to use it with Netscape. If I had to rely on this book to introduce me to XML, it would fail miserably. However, when I saw the possibilities of using XML to communicate between the client and server in the background, a whole new world opened up for our product. It is now interactive without a screen refresh. We do field level validations in real time. We have dynamic content in dropdown list boxes. This knowledge alone is worth many, many times the price of the book."
__label__1,"JIM CARREY CAN'T ACT: This is yet another Jim Carrey movie that features his terminally bad overacting.

It might actually have been good."

I can't wait for Set 13 to come out because the U.S. channels have quit showing the series. It's a shame because it was one of the best series on American TV. Since it's available on DVD, I'll be able to see the episodes they did not show on television. I put Chief Inspector Barnaby right up there with Inspector Morse. British murder mysteries are great."
__label__1,"Sets you up for a fall: The concept was very interesting: Damsel in 21st-Century distress. Enter the gallant knight from 700 years in the past. Hope is in dire straights and only a miracle in the form of a tortured but honorable Ronan Macleod can save her and her failing inn.The premise was what drew me in the first place. Unfortunately, the author never made good on her promise of a good love story. Once she introduced the main characters, the author seemed at a loss as to what to do with them. She tries to introduce more elements like a ghost, witches or fairies or however you want to call them, a sinister stalker, etc.Christina Skye seemed unsure of how to pull them all together. In the end, it felt like overkill; too many elements and incapability to pull them all together. It could have been a great story, but it never delivered what it promised. I recommend checking it out at the local library if you really want to read it."
__label__2,"For the most part I liked it.: A reader in WisconsinI read the book and for the most part I enjoyed it. The book have giving me many ideas on the the basic theme of blue and white. Two disappointment that I did have is that the color combinations were some what limited. (few blue-greens, violets, greyblues etc.) Also it tended to lack practical ideas for the average home. However for the most part it is helpful."
__label__1,"Stank: This film was one confusing blob of a mess. One of the worst films I've ever seen. It made me never want to read a Ludlum novel, since that's what it was based on. When I heard an audiotape of Ludlum's memoirs, and he said how he LIKED this film, it REALLY made me never want to read one of his books. Even Michael Caine in his autobiography says that when he got on the set, he read the script more closely, only then to realize it didn't make any sense. But he was stuck, and had to film the darn thing."
__label__2,"Dark victory.: This album is a complete departure from the first release. But, it still delivers well. A darker, more dismal recording, they still manage to rise above the ordinary and permeate the slumbering mind. I listen to this record often, and it has become such a big part of my life. Of all their catalogue, this is my favorite. It is not as spacious as the first release, but the songs are more meaningful and emotional this time out.They are still the best band in the world."
__label__2,"A very good movie: I was reading Les Miserables on my Kindle when an opportunity to see the musical onstage came my way. Being only 40% or so into the book at the time and not at all familiar with the story, I wanted to familiarize myself with it before going to see the play. So I am one of those people who thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it was extremely well done, and I wasn't familar with the story before seeing the movie. I did notice that when watching the play after watching the movie, there were characters I was only vaguely familiar with, but still, I consider it a movie well worth watching. Afterward, I finished the book and enjoyed it all the more for having seen the play and this movie."

One of the DVD's or VHS cassetts would have been a better buy."
__label__2,"Great book. A must for any Library!: Great book for any library. My only concern was with the seller. I ordered a Hardcover per the description, but received a paperback. I contacted the seller and they were willing to send a refund for the difference. The paperback was in great condition though and still made a great gift. Got my refund promplty though. If you order from them, just be patient."

__label__1,"OK, I guess.: ""The Gripping Hand"" is an OK sequel to ""The Mote in God's Eye"", I guess. But, I was not all that happy with it. I know these writers are capable of better story-telling than this and marked it a little low, because of my disappointment. ""Mote"" had a good deal of 'action'. This sequel has less action and more beating around the bush. There are plenty of words. But, they do not seem to add up to much in this story. I got through the story, but had to wonder: ""So what?"" for a bit.Who knows? Perhaps Niven got tired for a while? Some of that 'tiredness' ahows in some of his solo works from this time. Who knows? What I do know is that this book could have and should have been better."

A few of the honorees were picked on in high school, but one is out for revenge. It also tells the tale of adaption and a mother's yern to protect her daughter.I really enjoyed the book. There were a few things that I didn't like aout this book, but they were small. The first thing I didn't like was that there were to many characters and if you don't pay careful attention, you could get confused The second thing I didn't like was the ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I feel that it could've been a bit better. Other then that, I really enjoyed the book."

I have three of these now and use them to pull air through the house when the weather is nice. These fit perfectly in my windows. I typically have 2 sucking air in at one end of the house and the third at the other end blowing air out. They have been powerful enough for me and my wife and we typically keep them on the low setting and have no issues with them keeping us awake. The high setting is a bit loud but I don't think it's overly loud like some of the reviews state but sound is really subjective.Also, check Walmart for these fans, I picked up the other 2 I own from there for under $20/ea"
__label__1,"Ugh: Unless you're really (and I mean REALLY) into dance music (hard core, not Jennifer Lopez), then you'd probably do well to forgo this recording. Parts of it (""Pop Muzik"" and this version of ""Numb"") are absolutely torturous. There is an interesting, if uninspired cover of ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"". ""Last Night on Earth"" is just boring. I give it two stars because I guess it's okay as far as dance music goes, and U2 gets points for trying something new (not many points, but points nonetheless). However, I would suggest spending your on another U2 cd, such as ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"", ""Achtung Baby"" or ""October."""

__label__1,"Don't quit your day job Jennifer!: I believe Jennifer Lopez is a talented actress but she doesn't have strong enough vocals to become a real singer. Her videos are hip and cool and are possibly the reason people are going to buy her CD but I think if you carefully listen to her, you can tell she's really trying. I caught her rendition of ""If you had my love"" on the Letterman and it was no wonder the backup singers were singing louder than her. I think Jennifer should seriously reconsider acting because it's one profession in which she doesn't have to try so hard."

I followed all the instructions and kept the heat on low and didn't use any cooking spray. I had to scrape my eggs out of the pan.To make matters worse,there's no 800 numbers to Farberware so you could speak to someone. The only way you can contact them is to set up an account with them. Farberware was a name you could trust in cookware. In my opinion their a hasbeen. Your better off spending your cash at Walmart. Their pans cheaper, and perform a lot longer."

This morning, I went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4"" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic. I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours. A total waste of money."
__label__1,"Poorly organized, bad grammar: This book covers a vast array of networking topics, and can serve as a quick primer or reference. However, the depth of treatment varies inexplicably: some areas are explored in way too much detail for an overview text, while others don't have enough information to provide a good basic understanding of the subject. The quality of the text is extremely poor: there is hardly a paragraph without multiple grammar, spelling and punctuation errors, which is very annoying. Another major drawback is the lack of a glossary; by the nature of the subject the book is peppered with acronyms, and looking them up in the index is tedious, because there are many references for most terms and no way to know which one points to a definition.Not recommended."

I keep buying her books hoping for the return of that almost erotic feel in Banner O'Brien. The first love scene in this book was the biggest let down. Where isthe fire, spark and flame? Shoot, more Mandy didn't even get any foreplay???? Oh well, Kade is happy. I gave this 2 stars because I love the the idea the stories are built upon."

Yes, director Alvidsen has taken this approach before, but isn't the old saying, if it ain't broke don't fix it? GRADE: B+"
__label__1,Looks are deceiving.: The CD player started skipping after only a few months. The radio was never moved and was never treated poorly.
__label__1,not very champa: used it and it is not worth the money! chandrika is 1/4 the price and it smells way more than this. will not be purchasing it again...disappointed
__label__1,"Overwritten, self-hating tripe: If you want to read the purple prose of a man who is deeply ashamed of being latino and gay--in fact, so ashamed of the latter that he paints a picture of gays and lesbians as a talentless lot of artificial people doomed by moral pestilence-- then this is the book for you. If you're white and heterosexual and you're looking for a brown-skinned person to make you feel like you're culturally superior, why this book will be downright therapeutic!"
__label__2,"For those starved for ROCK--Check out Billionaire.: Tremendous musicianship, catchy hooks, and an absolutely killer live band. The CD is truly a breath of fresh air if N Sync and Britney Spears make you wretch.(And they should)"
__label__2,"WOW - Don't Resist This for another Minute - FanTAStic: I thought Alicia Keyes was the only neo-soul passion player to emerge in 2001. Was I wrong! I resisted even dabbling in India.Arie's album thinking no one could come close to Keyes' depth and emotion, AND do it with a melody. India.Arie eliminated any doubts I had from the opening track and throughout this important, one-of-a-kind innovation! Much more than a bunch of well crafted songs, ""Acoustic Soul"" IS music for the masses and deserves to be hailed as a landmark album, and as a testament to the pure power of music! Don't wait - this is a CLASSIC and will be remembered as the debut of one of tomorrow's great stylists. A MUST OWN, and easily one of the best albums of 2001. BRAVA!"
__label__2,"My Favorite Tea: I would say that this tea is probably not for everyone, but as a tea lover, I was happy with the flavors. It has a unique scent and the box isn't as poorly constructed as some of the other reviews claim. Tea chests can cost a lot and for the price, this product is reasonable. I will order again."
__label__1,"To be and to have DVD: Unfortunately the DVD I received was a region 1 DVD, and could not be played i Denmark, which I informed you about, and after som exchanges of mail you very kindly arranged a refund to my account of the purchase price and I have bought the same DVD from another source, although I probably could have bought a usable DVD from ecom in the UK, but this information was never relayed to me. I only have to live with the cost of importing the DVD into Denmark, about the purchase value of the DVD, but every experience costs money, normally.So thank you for your service in this matter.Best regardsPeter Daugbjerg"
__label__2,One of my favorites: This movie was Johnny's best yet. I think its great for the entire family. I would recommend to anybody young and old.
__label__1,Horrible: I can only get 3 channels to work properly.I either don't get reception for other channels or the signal is choppy at best.Waste of money.
__label__1,"for aspiring gourmet chefs only: Based on this book's title, I believed I would get simple, delicious recipes. Instead, I found recipes for meals that I would expect to find on the menu at a gourmet restaurant. I have a four-year-old step-daughter to consider when I cook, and I know she wouldn't touch half of the meals this book contains. Additionally, many of the recipes contain obscure ingredients like tapenade, lamb's kidneys, and goat cheese. Am I the only one who doesn't have these items on my grocery list? I guess I might use one or two of the main dish recipes if I were trying to impress a dinner guest... I will say that the soup, salad and dessert recipes look inviting, but I wouldn't make those either unless I were entertaining. All in all, I don't suggest buying the book unless you're an aspiring gourmet chef."
__label__2,"where was I when these things were invented?!: Just got the item today. It was well packaged and shipped fast. The item itself is small, pretty quiet, and has everything to just get to ripping those unwanted hairs out. I've been waxing for the last 2 years, I like to wax mainly my eyebrows now because waxing anything else is just to time consuming and messy. I used this as soon as it arrived on my legs and bikini line. It does a great job. I have coarse and fine hair and it seems to get them all. I'm so excited to not have to mess around with wax, or waste so much money on razors! I don't think this is the best thing for your face though because of the pain. I have a high tolerance to waxing, but facial hair (youch!) I'd rather just tweeze that. I read all the reviews before I bought this, and I've got to say, I'm 100% happy so far! If it lasts even a year, it will save me so much money. And it's summer now, who wants to shave every other day and deal with razor burn?! Not this lady!"
__label__1,"No bottle caps: I had very good luck with Mr. Beer and wanted a second keg and bottle caps so I can make more. No bottle caps were included despite what the description/photo promise. So if you're like me and threw out bottle caps, don't buy this kit to get more."
__label__2,"Easy to follow: This book was great for learning how to fight. I was able to understand the thinking of a great fighter, and to learn some of his escape and block techinques. A must-have if learning to fight for any reason. You never know who will be able to put you on the mat, and this book helped me understand what is needed."
__label__2,"Good, but still gets stained.: I was hoping to find a bib that could withstand the day to day exposure to orange foods and not end up looking dirty. This one does a better job than the clear plastic bibs, but the edge still looks a bit stained. It does a great job catching food and liquid, and it's easy for my daughter to retrieve cereal that didn't quite make it to her mouth. I may have her wear it in the car and just start with cereal in the bib, so she can snack during the drive."
__label__2,silent hill4 the easy way: this book is very helpful in completing the game you don't spend hours running around in circles or opening the wrong doors to lead to an instant death great maps and documentation
__label__2,Very good for Christians wondering how to reconcile this: Rev. Kader does a very good job. Every Christian should read this book. It answers those hard questions and brings hope! Both straight and gay Christians will find it enlightening..the Bible really is gay friendly!
__label__2,"social intelligence from an emotional intelligence perspective: I won't say much, just that D.Goleman is writting social intelligence from an emotional intelligence perspective, and also his writting style has not changed (It could be improved, some examples are off topic etc).But overall, it's all good material there"
__label__2,wonderful !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: My daughter absolutely loves this book and had to have it. Says it's her favorite book. She read this at school and wanted it for her own personal library.
__label__1,"Not Worth the Paper it's Printed On: To be worthwhile a biography must offer some insight into the person about whom it is written. If what is written is extremely negative that goes double. Martha Stewart is undoubtabley difficult to work for and work with. She is also very, very good at what she does. This book provides no insight whatsoever into what makes Martha Stewart tick. Instead we get story after story of nasty, small mindedness coupled with psycho-babble on how she was abused as a child. This writer has not done his homework he has simply compiled a lot of rotten stories. The real biography of this driven, complex woman is bound to be facinating but this is not it."
__label__1,"It didn't work and it was uncomfortable: I brought this product to help with my knee. I have chondromalachia, and struggle a great deal with walking up and down steps of any kind.Unfortunately for me, the product didn't help any. There was a very slight reduction of pain, but the strap used to secure the product in place behind my knee was very uncomfortable and even in the short duration I spent testing it, rubbed quite painfully. I would not have wanted to wear this for very long, and had I done so, would have feared that I might have developed sores behind my knee or other skin irritation.I don't know if other buyers would definitely have the same problems I experienced. Perhaps my knee was just a bit too big to fit comfortably (normally I wear an extra large size knee brace), and perhaps my chondromalachia is a bit too severe for this product to do any good. Others might have better luck."
__label__1,Nono would be a better name then tutu: This this is tiny My daugter is 3 and it doesn't fit her lucky I have a 12m old that can use it. The tape to the video for is horrible you can't hear it is all static Don't buy it
__label__1,"Not good at all: Bought one last year and was able to use for only 2 weeks. Now it plays (both ordinary cd audio and mp3's) sometimes but most of the time it will not recognize the cd at all. The player did not undergo any rough handling or anything. If all the reviews about how good this product is true, then I guess I'm just unlucky."
__label__1,Not happy with the ecom delivery system for viewing: Awkward interface from ecom Unbox. Was unable to put the file onto a portable drive and transfer to a dvd or phone. I won't be ordering anymore digital things like this from ecom unless they change the delivery method. The Bubble Guppies are awesome though!
__label__2,"Farberware coffee pot: I was pleased to find this product available for less than the store I found one at. It came promptly and since it was a gift for my mother, I really appreciated it. She had been looking for one since she had such good luck (and good coffee) with her previous one.Thank you"
__label__1,"Don't Get Your Hopes Up!: The product leaves a sticky feeling. I didn't see any results.

__label__2,"Best Game Ever-Saved My Mind: I work a lot and never really had time for anything, I went to sleep and would dream of work then I would wake up and work some more.Mass Effect is one of the best games ive ever played being a fan of Fable, Gears of War series, the Halo series ect.And its super cheap so its a must buy and i chipped in the extra cash to over night it,"
__label__1,"Ink Hog: I laid to rest my old HP All-in-One for the quicker MP830. Well, everything said in previous reviews is true including chugging ink. OH MY HEAVENS it goes thru ink like water off a ducks back. I had it 2 months and hardly had printed a thing on it and had to replace the ink. Now here I am only a couple of months later and now need to replace ALL THE INK. At this rate of buying ink at 15 bucks each and it needs 5 I could have purchased a color laser printer and still been ahead of the game."

__label__2,"Another great read from Coben....: although slightly similar to The Woods, I still really enjoyed this book......Coben continues to write great stories, I can't wait for the movie."
__label__1,"Great music, only one cd.: Reason for my rating is the fact I only got one cd. I mean, 51 bucks for one cd is messed up. I guess I bought it after reading the reviews hoping the cd had like a bonus disc inside that they didn't put on the description... oh well. If you got the money and would like to own atleast ONE of the cd of this album, buy it."
__label__1,"Very disappointing.: First I'm going to say: I'm 20, I love Prog music and thus, I love Kansas, and I even met Steve Walsh once. But this album is weak, it kinda starts out strong, but ends in disappointment. I've tried to listen to it, but none of the tracks really stand out. Its not that its bad, the production values are good, and some of the riffs are kinda cool. But nothing stands to far above mediocre, the music is okay but not great or really all that progressive either. Lyrically it pretty weak(I fear Walsh's Creative juices have run dry), but after all the great songs Walsh is written with Kansas you gotta give him credit for trying. One the main problems is I think Steve Walsh's voice is about shot. He just can't belt it out like he used too, and this is apparent on this album and the recent Kansas live recordings.Fans of Walsh's other solo work, or fans of Kansas's post-1970s sound may find something to like here but to me its a letdown."
__label__2,"Brief review of Ember: Hi, I really liked this book because it's a mystery and exciting. The main characters are Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow. They solve a surprising secret in Ember that could change the whole city (with subtle clues along the way). This book is for people who like mystery, excitement and cliffhangers. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!"

__label__1,"complicated assembly instructions: The assembly can take over an hour, the instructions are not clear and its not worth the time spent to assemble this hardware which should be really simple for a simple product like a bunch of shelves. Won't buy this again."
__label__2,"Adventure without the hype. Great family fare.: An enjoyable pic; This video is well worth a view. High adventure with a low budget, this show displays some of my favorite actors. Perfect for all ages. A great addition to any Zorro fan's collection."
__label__2,"Best album of the 90's: I know everyone will say Ten, Nevermind, or Murmor was a better album, but OK Computer is definitely the best. Ok Computer is a saga of great music in which you have to listen in its entirety. It is a great concept album where each song is different but yet the same. Rather than a whole cd of singles, OK Computer tells its own story. Your mood goes up and down from a hard paranoid android to a softer Subterranean Homesick Alien. When I listen to OK Computer I never change the tracks, the album tells a story and you don't want to miss a chapter. That's what makes OK Computer the best album of the 90's,"
__label__1,"It leaks!: Pros:Doesn't look like a cheap piece of crap.Cons:Is a cheap piece of crap.It leaks from the bottom, profusely. Now I need to go buy sealant to fix it, so factor that into the purchase cost. When I think of the one most important thing that a fountain should do, it should hold water. I understand that testing this at the factory must be hard...You'd need 1) some water and 2) 30 seconds of quality control time.It is very pretty. Just be prepared to do some work on it.Update: I couldn't seal all of the leaks in the original fountain, so I returned it for a replacement. Guess what? This one leaks too! A lot. I'm going to return for a refund this time, drop my rating to one star, and find a better fountain from a company that cares about quality control enough to test its products before shipping them out."
__label__2,"Hit It...Dead on!: I have to agree!!! I have both versions of this DVD and its AWESOME!!! :0) BJ....FANTASTIC WORK! And I know some of us fans are still getting use to the newer versions of the songs, but I STILL have to say that the new version of DEAD OR ALIVE, ROCKS!!!! Its funkier!!!Way to go!"
__label__2,"Read Allen's book first...: This book has changed my life. I will not go over what other readers have commented on, but would like to make a suggestion. If your GTD system is already set up, yet you cannot get into the flow, please read ""Isn't It About Time?"" by Andrea Perry. While Allen's book provides excellent structure to time management, Perry's book provides excellent insights into what might be delaying implementation. The book was written by a British author in a charming way, and not readly available, but well worth reading."
__label__2,"A Mystifying Event: Curtain is an extemely interesting story with tangled events and twisted facts that lead to three murders. In the first parts of the book, it may be difficult to keep your attention on reading. However, you will soon see that you just can't put the book down. Curtain is the first Agatha Christie book I have read, and it left me eager to pick up more of her masterpieces."
__label__1,Disappointed: Disappointed that my order was cancelled with no reason given. Won't order from them again
__label__2,"a great effort!: I was not a follower of spice girls in their heyday. However this cd did catch my eye . Half of the cd was good to down right GREAT. What I don't understand about most artist's out there now, is they can't make up their mind what type of music they really want to play or go after. This one is a great example, does she want to go into A ""POP MODE"" or A ""grunge type"" Personally I like the pop music option, this she has a natural knack for. If she continues on this track, I think this guy would buy everything she records."
__label__2,Great music: I love this CD. It's wonderful music to listen to in the car on a long drive. It has a nice blend of some of her best recordings. I'm very happy that I purchased it.
__label__1,"Oh no!: This album is not representative. It's Motorhead's weakest release up to date. It's just heavy and maybe Lemmy tried to show that he and his buddys are the heaviest, dirtiest and loudest on earth but they aren't. Only for true fans."
__label__2,"Leadership for the real world: Clear cut illustrations and simple truths abound in this book. However, the strongest point of ""21 Qualities"" is the emphasis on implementation. Each leadership quality is expounded on, but takes the extra step of issuing specific challenges. If you desire to strengthen the inward frame of your character, you have to walk it out in your everyday life. That is exactly what this book is all about."
__label__1,"Short life span and frustrating problems: If you are looking for an inexpensive DVD/VCR system to use for a couple years, this is a great deal. However, for greater longevity I'd look elsewhere. I've had this combo for two years almost to the day and the DVD player all of a sudden stopped reading the DVDs. My mother-in-law had bought herself the same system at the time and her VCR portion just recently stopped working. I called support and they could not help and suggested bringing it somewhere to have it fixed. Of course, doing that would cost more than just getting a new one. Another problematic element on this system is that the VCR portion will not record a different show than the one you are watching. I repeatedly called support about this problem and they kept saying to do the same thing over and over, to no avail. What good is that? My recommendation: splurge a little and get something that will last and that functions properly."
__label__2,"Translate: Every floating object should have this manual on board, sail and power. Why not translate it to a few languages from cultures with a lot of sailors? (German,Dutch, French, Spanish,etc.)"
__label__2,"John has done it Once Again: John's second effort is more than just G.O.O.D. its GREAT! When I first heard Once Again I wasn't sure I would like it, mainly due to my expectations based on Get Lifted. Once Again is not Get Lifted pt.2, it stands firmly on its own two feet, but you will get lifted (pun intended). John blends good old soul music with his own style to create wonderful songs such as ""Each Day Gets Better"", ""Slow Dance"" and ""Where Did My Baby Go"", to name a few. You still get a Get Lifted feel with songs like ""Stereo"", ""Again"" and ""Another Again"". Of course John takes you to his Gospel roots with ""Heaven"" and ""Show Me"". This album has something for everyone, if you go in with an open mind you will come out with a musical experience you won't soon forget."
__label__1,"Beware!!: We ordered this piece along with the 6 drawer dresser and the nightstand. All of which had scratches on them. This piece, however had the most damanged. It took Target three times to send us this before we got one that wasn't extremely damanged. We had to repackage and ship back the first two which was a headache on it's own. Even the UPS man told us he has to pick up a lot of Target stuff because they don't package it well and it should really be sesnt Freight instead of UPS ground. I love the look of the piece and wish it was better quality."

__label__1,"Very overrated!: The script really didn't make sense much and the show was kind of lame. Probably one of the worst shows on television. It's like watching The Wonder Years sort of except it was set in the 80's. The best show on television is Friends, The Simpsons, and Seinfeld. Those I would recommened but not Freaks and Geeks."
__label__2,"A story that keeps you reading until you reach the back cove: I have read this book soooo many times the cover and pages fell apart. One of my children thought it was an old book and threw it away ! :o( I'm in search of a new one and would also be interested in any other books she may have written. The Tiger's Woman hit home for me on a very personal level and only wished there was a hero/heroine like these in my life. Thanks, Celeste"
__label__2,"It's worth the time: The question that needs to be answered before reading any book is: is it worth the effort and time? Quite simply, Death Rat! is a yes. Filled with the wit and humor of Mike Nelson, and a book that encompasses the feel and atmosphere of Minnesota, Death Rat! should be on your reading list. The story provides insight to the celebrity world that Mike Nelson never found himself fitting into, and insight into the publishing industry, that from the novel Mike Nelson has little affection for. Enjoyable and entertaining."
__label__2,"Great Collection to the New Moby Fan: I am a new Moby fan, I bought play around a year ago after listening to it at a sound station, and this collection of his earlier album is just right for people like me that want to be exposed to his earlier music. Most tracks come from Everything Is Wrong, another great album by him. There are only a couple of songs from I Like To Score, Ambient, Animal Rights, etc. But this cd was rushed out for release because of Moby's finally-found success. Yet Play's remarkable gospel-pop-techno feel isnt here. Its like pure techno- the songs Go and Move (You Make Me Feel So Good) are great club songs. At a party, you could just play all of the albums 17 tracks consecutively without problem. But I was disappointed to see that there was no booklet insert, considering i coughed up 17.88 for it. Oh Well, its a great cd. Get it if you are a new fan of moby. Dont even bother otherwise-there is no new songs introduced or anything. Just plain ol' Moby."
__label__2,"Kettler Roma Chairs: Great quality, they are comfortable and durable. I purchase a pair for my wife and I. My wife unknowingly purchased a pair for her and I. We kept them all."
__label__2,The ghost album: This is by far Mum's spookiest album. This one I refer to as the 'ghost album'. I love the oceanic theme and overall haunting atmosphere. The howling winds and crashing waves evoke a profound sense of loneliness and fear. This album also features new interesting sound textures and more minimal orchestration than 'Finally...' and a lot more eerie baby-like vocals. The only disappointment is that it's only about 45mins long. I was hoping the would be at least one of those tracks which extends up to 12mins or more. I love those.The music conjures mental images of a greenish ominous sky like in 'The City Of Lost Children' and many blurred apparitions (mostly women and children).
__label__2,"""My Favorite Album Of All Time"": For me to be able to review and share my love for music is such an opportunity. Stevie has always been a ""prophet"" through music.

We must continue to express our ""INNERVISION"". peace and love, keithm..."
__label__1,"Meh: They tried to do their own take on some of the songs plus some of singers just DID NOT fit. It worked very well for some of the songs like for Nathan Lane as The Cowardly Lion ( when he wasn't forcing jokes into the songs, yuck! ) and the Munchkins but some of the songs like Scarecrow and Tinman they changed up to the point that they were almost completely different and not very good. Jackson Browne made for a depressing Scarecrow IMO. And I REALLY wish they rerecorded it the audience and the acoustics do not make for a good album.BUT I will say this, it is worth a listening to. The previews available should give you a good idea what your in for and if you don't mind the flaws you'll most likely enjoy the album."
__label__1,"wrong format: Cannot play on player...Believe it to be a foreign format and should have been advertised that way...If possible, would like credit for this item..Can also return if possible"
__label__1,"NOT THE ORIGINAL SONGS, OFTEN!!!!: This is Bunk, while some songs are original, many are not. Chicago's 25 or 6 to 4 sounds like the original singer, but it is not the album or single cut of this classic. The Troggs Wild Thing is simply butchered by a bunch of idiots who are NOT the Troggs.Note the title, carefully crafted so as not to claim that these are actually the originals. Trust me, they are not.DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!"
__label__1,"Did I read the same book?: I thought the hero a boor who wanted everything his way. He's keeping a mistress even though he plans to marry another woman?!?! It seems lately all I've read in romances are about women whose only attraction is their beauty. The men are all FABULOUSLY wealthy but with no depth of character. Poor as I may be, I cannot seriously see myself attracted to a man who couldn't hold an intelligent conversation - no matter how great the sex. And I so wanted to like this book because of the previous reviews. Very disappointed."
__label__1,"JUNK: If your considering buying this, do yourself a favor and buy a broom instead. This thing is ALMOST as useful as one.Cord is short, cannot reach across medium sized room. I live in an old house with few plugs, but do you really need to change plugs while dust-busting? Too heavy to use as a hand held, with an awkward shape, makes for emptying canister a little tricky. The handle needs to be extended to empty, which is also awkward. After using 3 times, has begun to have a burning smell after more than 5 min of use.This is just JUNK."
__label__1,Awful movie - not worth spending the time watching any of it.: Skip this one! The reviews lead me to believe it was good - so much for trusting reviewers. Worst movie in years.
__label__1,"Cheap Zoom Lever: Complete disappointment. The camcorder has so many features, but the zoom lever easily popped off and left the lens unable to zoom. Panasonic would not stand by their product and I was unable to get the camera fixed without a substantial fee. After four calls I was unsatisfied and the camera still cannot zoom. At a store I found that the zoom lever easily comes off. Avoid this product. There are too many cheap factors that can ruin the great features. Technical and customer support are useless."
__label__1,"This is a boring book: Don't waste your time or money on this book - unless you like to read incredibly dull history. It would turn anyone off history. I would give it zero stars if I could. If you are looking for something along the lines of ""What-If"" or Harry Turtledove - forget it. The authors spend so much time delivering the most trivial facts that they never get down to what might have happened. B-O-R-I-N-G!"
__label__2,Massager is Back to Normai: It is so nice to be able to revitalize my Oster Stim-U Lax Massager.I do a lot of Massage for family and friends and I use the massager on a very regular basis.When the unit began cutting out on its own I trouble shot it and discovered the the issue was in the power cord.I went to the Oster website and discovered that they offered the power cord assembly for a very reasonable price.When it arrived I installed it easily into my old massager and it was just LIKE new.(caution should be taken when tightening the screws to the upper assembly. over tightening the screws can cause the upper assembly retaining holes to shear off) .
__label__1,"Not worth the 78 cents a used one is selling for.: I'd say they should let this failed franchise die a quiet death, but it already is dead. This thing is awful.

I found it to have loose ends (...I found it to be somewhat boring....the whole Claws story line didn't make sense, and I felt that Ms. Evanovich couldn't develope the story line in her mind, thus, she wrote willy nilly and figured that people would purchase the book because it was written by her.I found myself reading the unbearable book, just trying to get done. I've lent the book to a few massive fans, just like myself, and no one was happy with the book. I can only recall two laughs, Grandma's teeth, and Valerie's doughy comments, those were the only one's. ..."

She had to go, so I pressed the disconnect button to hang up, and then the bluetooth just freaked out...anytime I opened the mouthpiece it began auto-dialing my wife's cellphone. Tried to dial a different number with the same results..any noise in the vicinity of the mouthpiece was interpreted as a voice command, error message said no voice tags loaded, and the bluetooth would attempt to redail the last number called...tried to troubleshoot, tried downloading the manual...no help.

This means no gyros, no leaning, no self-balancing, none of the breakthrough engineering that makes the Segway the way of the future.How they can list this as ""segway style"" is beyond me. If that is accurate than my car is Ferrari style in that it has a steering wheel, my wife is Pamela Anderson style in that she has two legs and some eyelashes and my cat is puma style in that he has some whiskers. In short, the comparison is misleading and dishonest (sorry, honey)."
__label__1,"Readable? Yes. Memorable? No.: I've been reading Julie Garwood since her early work in historical romance; marvelous books such as ""The Bride,"" ""Honor's Splendour,"" and ""Saving Grace"" captivated me and kept me reading for hours. Once done, I'd want to start again. Her pages were full of clever wit, suspensful intrigue, and beautiful romance, elements that Ms. Garwood's contemporary romances, including this latest one, seem to lack. Readable? Yes. Memorable? No."
__label__2,"Great Pregnancy Workout: I love this pregnancy workout DVD. I purchased it when I was about 14 weeks along and have been using it for approximately 10 weeks, now. This is NOT a fancy DVD and the transitions are definitely dated looking, but the actual workout is good. I was in the best shape of my life before becoming pregnant from using weights and cardio and I appreciate that this DVD lets me continue that mix. It also offers beginner, intermediate and advanced examples of each workout. My only wish is that it were a little more intense/shorter so that I had more time to do it before work in the mornings. As it stands, this is my go-to weekend workout."

I have all the other ""In Death"" titles prior to this one and had planned to download the complete seires on my Kindle. I am disappointed......UPDATE: 12/6/12 It is available now, ""Thanks"" Now I am very happy"
__label__2,Enjoyable Read but is Lacking: This was an enjoyable read but I found it was lacking in a few areas. The language in the book can be a little crude. Not a big deal but I think it cheapens the book and characters. I don't feel like the characters were build up enough either. There is also a lot of sex scenes which become mundane after awhile. For the most part I liked the story-line and characters. Overall it was a fun read and will read the rest of the series.
__label__1,"Very Disappointing, terrible editing: I enjoyed the other books by this author but this one falls far short of expectations. The middle of the book slowed to a snail's pace with page after page of wordy, endless soul-searching by the characters. The action finally picked up in the last 50 pages but ended up not being worth the effort.The editing was awful! Incorrect words, incorrect tense, plurals instead of singulars and vice versa.After forcing myself to finish this book while flying, I left it on the plane. It was not worth carrying it back home."
__label__1,"puff daddy: i am disappointed with this product. Too expensive and clearly designed for ease of production and not for your animal.The filler is all center mass. The sowing that holds the filler is sewn in at the base. So one matter that size dog, the dog will be laying on a lump. Other positive reviews I saw must have been written by the vendor."
__label__2,Great basic camera: I have had this camera for a couple years. I don't have anything specifically exciting to say about it because I am not a techie person. But I will say I have been completely happy with it.
__label__2,GOOD READ: another very readable novel from wallace. if you like wallace you will like this. some great characters and twists along the way.
__label__1,"Halloween H2O, last was one of the worst: I went to the theatre expecting to see a great scary sequel to all the halloween movies. When I saw the movie, I had all the emotions about it that I didn't want to have. It was boring, no where near scary, and what is up with it being so short. The only thing that I liked about this movie was Jamie Lee Curtis's attitude. She finally quits running away and faces her problem. I have seen all the other Halloween movies but this was the 2nd to worst one (Halloween 3 being the worst). But, contrary to my review, I do recomend seeing it, but only so you can see how the series ends, but if this is your first halloween, try to pick a different one."
__label__1,"Modeling in wax for jewelry and sculpture: A bit disapointed by this book. I guess so many books now have great photos and are put together so well that an old fashioned style manual like this just doesn't inspire. I'm sure it's full of really useful stuff, but the format is so off putting that I can't be bothered to read it. A really good, modern book on wax carving with lots of interesting projects is long overdue.."
__label__1,"MPI Goof: I wanted to respond to the many reviewers regarding the poor audio quality of this DVD. Evidentally, the transfer was not up to the newer DVD player technology because it plays fine in my older player, but I experience a sound problem when I play it in my newer one. I intend to contact MPI and hopefully get this resolved, and a new, updated copy of this DVD.Until then, this one gets 1 star."

__label__1,"REFUND??: BEAUTY--IF IT ONLY STAYED TOGETHERI fell in love with the shape and style of this piece, when i saw it at a friends house. However, her problems soon, became mine- No matter what we did the piece didn't stay together. Constant GAPS between the shelves and side panels and the shelves fell often. I've even used wood glue and am now trying new dowels, but to no avail. I own the rest of the collection, and this is the only one i've had problems with. I am inches away from putting it in the dump. What a pain and tragedy for such a beautiful piece."
__label__2,"Greed Pricing, Get Free Summaries Online: This book is now priced so unreasonably I cannot recommend it. Instead, search online for ""NATO's Secret Armies"" by Stephen Lendman, his very long article is both free and of very high quality.A more reasonably priced book on CIA terrorism isEdward Lansdale's Cold War (Culture, Politics, and the Cold War).

The gifts that God gives us are right there in up comming stars like Michael Juinor, Charlet Church and the likes of these young people who are allready international stars and will go forth with their fortune that God has given them. Dreamland was beautiful, powerful, happy and what can I say but great. If you have a chance to see the production don't miss it. He is becomming the next Andrea Bochelli."
__label__2,"Great book, I couldn't stop reading!: This is a terrific book, that really sucks the reader into the story. Our protagonist Martin purchases a large antique mirror that once belonged to his favorite movie star Boofuls, a singing and dancing child star of the late 1930s who met a brutal demise. Martin soon discovers the mirror holds another realm in which little Boofuls has been living. And waiting. I couldn't tear my eyes away, I devoured this book even though it is quite lengthy. If you like anything concerning the dark and seedy side of Hollywood you will LOVE this. The novel has a great, well thought out plot with quite a few blood curdling scenes, and that ""I just have to know what happens, so I'm going to keep reading."" feeling. Get a copy, they are practically giving away used editions."
__label__2,Excellent book for understanding the internals of Servlets.: This book can be an excellent source of understanding and knowledge for beginers and experts as wel.

__label__2,Jordan is Awesome: This is by far the most gripping series of books I have ever read. I hope this series goes on FOREVER ! Kill off the Forsaken slowly....and bring back Moiraine-We miss her. I buy the hardback edition of each book and do not sleep until I have finished the book !! I have read these books over and over again....I love them
__label__1,Disappointed: This deal never happened. I ordered this item and tried to contact the vendor on 2 occassions but never got a response. I cancelled the order and ecom was very good about handling the claim and promptly refunding my money.
__label__1,Deceptive images: The image presented for the .3 is deceptive. The .3 does not come in a silnylon pouch as depicted in the image. I believe the pouch is a good part of the value of the product as it is bright yellow and is highly visible when in the pack and finding it quickly is of utmost urgency. Since the virtual shopping experience does not allow for hands on inspection of the product the images are critical that they are accurate and depict the product being purchased.
__label__2,"excellent: Jeff Shaara does something most history teachers can't do-He makes history readable and engrossing. He does an excellent job of letting the events drive the narrative, while capturing the reader with the picture of the characters. As I read I could see the transformation of both John and Samuel Adams-in many ways reversing roles. In fact it was nice to see the heroes of the revolution treated as people on a journey to become revolutinaries. Finally, I think his greatest contribution to m y understanding was helping me see that neither side really understood the other and seeing the arrogance of empire (perhaps a lesson some of our current politicians could learn)Excellent"
__label__2,"Can use for many purposes: I bought these with the idea of cloth diapering my first child in them, however I didn't really like using them in that way. I prefer fitted cloth diapers. However, these are very absorbent and I use them as general all over the place cloths. They are great as burp cloths and wiping up various baby liquids and foods. I even use them under my baby when I am changing her so that I don't have to was the changing pad cover with every mess.So I have found these very useful just not for what I intended when I bought them."

__label__2,"Best fantasy series yet: Think Robert Jordan Crossed with George Martin. Super complex, and interesting, plot. Yes there are thing you may not understand at first, but that is on purpose, the characters don't understand either. As the series progresses the reader and the characters both learn more and more. Don't miss this."
__label__2,"A Golden Book!: This book is a treasure! Especially if you have Golden Retrievers. It is mostly photos but it does include inspirational, and interesting stories about the breed. The photos feature goldens of all ages, shades, and sizes. They are featured in snow, on swings, in beds and on the laps of their owners. Each dog feautred is beautiful. The author Dean Koontz even provides a photo of his own dog, and a chapter from one of his books, in which the main character is a Golden Retriever. I highly reccomend this book."
__label__1,a big disapointment: Wow what a disapointment this book was. Poor use of images and text and bad advice on how to arrange it all that you'll find here. I know that there are better guides on web page design out there.
__label__1,"This is NOT the Tim Burton Version: I know from first hand experience, because I ordered this video from ValleyCD, that the tape they offer is NOT Tim Burton's version of Hansel and Gretel. The reason they don't have a picture of the product on here is because the box clearly lists a different director. Do not be fooled by ValleyCD. The only people who have a copy of this movie are Disney and Tim Burton, and they're not sharing. ValleyCD is operating a scam. The tape they offer is a German orchestral version of Hansel and Gretel. They are liars."
__label__1,"Not good value: It's hard to recommend this issue. The performances are nothing special, the texts are in German only - and this full-price CD contains less than 43 minutes of music."
__label__2,"The previous review must be bogus.: He writes and I quote, ""Only a moron would accept that as ""proof,"" and yet ID-iot Christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of ""proof"" from ID-iotic films like this"".Obviously this man thinks it's a film rather than a book, so much for reading it and a fair critical review."
__label__1,"Product was defective: Since I had earlier ordered a Palm Tungsten E2Handheld from ecom before and it was in working condition upon arrival, I had the confidence that I could do the same for a gift purchase.However, when I received the product and gave it as a gift, it turned out that the receipient could not use it as the product was defective. The right hand side of the screen did not respond to taps by the stylus and could not scroll easily either. I was embarrassed by this as I had given the product as a gift.I have since returned the product via Customer Returns last Wednesday and would expect to have a full refund as soon as possible."
__label__2,"If you don't like The Wire, you're an idiot!: First and foremost, David Simon is a genius. Homicide: A year on the Killing Streets, The Corner, both amazing stories and shows. The acting is brillinat, with each side of the ""drug war"" having their own problems which shape perspectives.Aside from the above rant, the show ranks as one of the best shows on TV currently, and will go down in history as a fantastic character study."
__label__1,"THE TOYMAKER =PURE RUBBISH: First off as many of you may know this has nothing to do with the series like the previous movie. Also the story isn't even revolved around X-MAS like it should be. The whole movie is about a child hating man that makes toys that come to life and kill their owner(reminds me of a rip off of child's play)but it gets worse the death scenes are so dumb they include rollerblades with rockets and attacking army men. SKIP ALL THE SILENT NIGHT'S EXCEPT THE CLASSIC (1984/SILENT NIGHT,DEADLY NIGHT) WHICH IS AN ORIGINAL HORROR CLASSIC THAT INVOLVES A KILLER SANTA ON X-MAS!"
__label__1,"TOTAL CRAP - SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!: We bought this in June of 2002 -- eleven months ago. VERY LIGHT USE considering we don't have many DVD's and only rent a few each month. In the middle of a new DVD I bought for my kids, the sound started to get low and scratchy. I tested another movie just to be sure and that also had very low sound. It is now at the point where our audio is turned to MAX and you can just barely hear it. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. Looks like I'll be out to find a non-Toshiba unit at a LOCAL store. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT BUY A TOSHIBA DVD!!!!"

__label__1,"How good is your PLO- apparently better than yours!: I had to post a review because these reviews are highly suspect. This is not an analytical book on proper PLO play. The author uses very little analysis of why he made certain plays, and sometimes his answer is simply that he was bored. Yet he still docks the reader points if you chose to fold! Many instances in the book his answers are factually wrong (ex. page 97 he states that Ah, 3h, 5d, 6d is 50% against Qh,Qc,2s,2c on a board of 9h,4c,2h, your choices are 40-60% in increments of 5%, while they answer i got on my PLO calculator was 46.46%. Are we rounding everything up?). The only redeeming quality for this book is to spot obvious errors in his play. A much better book on the subject is Secrets of Professional PLO."
__label__1,"very slow: Read all the good reviews on this game prior to purchase. We are a game playing family, but will not be playing this again. For six of us around the table to wait each time a player stared at a picture then answered questions about it was uninteresting, to say the least. Even after the staring, when questions are being posed, the non-staring players are totally excluded from the process -- can't even see the pictures as the cards are not large enough to be seen over the table and much of the detail is VERY SMALL. May be okay if two very sedate people play together, but my group was unanimous...put it back in the box!"
__label__2,"Very pleasant and relaxing: I actually got this CD from a friend who was listening to it in his office. I was like ""Hmmm... What is this?"" I absolutely love the smoothness of the sound, the way it just relaxes me and lulls me to sleep when I've had a rough day. I actually had Francesca stuck in my head for a whole weekend."

__label__2,"Best Underrated Williams film out there!: I don't understand why people panned this one. Williams was still a clown but rendered a dramatic performance that was second to none. Not quite as good as the ""Fisher King"" but then he didn't have Jeff Bridges to play off of."

__label__1,"Spore - Innovative Leap, Tripped in Implementation: What had all the makings of an evolutionary, if not revolutionary, game was pooched for the following reasons:- Limited interaction between visible traits and numbers (determinations made by numerical analysis, not taking benefit of user created physical traits into consideration)- DRM : game will cease to function for me in the near future after moderate hardware changes, requiring hours of hold time to get something I bought to work. Sort of like an exploding letter or ink that disappears. Much more akin to a rental for the price of a full purchase."
__label__2,"Incredible price for a top-rate product: My husband is a contractor so he regularly helps clients select and install lighting and Kichler is one of his preferred mid-range product lines. I needed a light for a new third bathroom vanity, but didn't want to spend a ton of money since mostly kids would be using the bathroom. I could not believe I found this for $32 on ecom so I snapped it right up and could not be happier. Excellent, great-looking lighting at a bargain price...go for it!"
__label__1,"Save your money: I took this dictionary to China to study Chinese intensively at what could be best described at a ""high-beginner"" level, and quickly found it was inadequate to the task. So many common words are omitted entirely that I was soon required to purchase an additional dictionary in China. My Concise dictionary? I left it behind to serve as a doorstop in Beijing."
__label__2,Dickens in America: All us lovers of the works of Charles Dickens certainly enjoy a rollicking retour of Dickens's 1842 trip to America. Miriiam Margolyes is a superb tour guide.
__label__1,"This is NOT the SHELL SEEKERS: This film bears only a passing resemblance to Rosamund Pilcher's THE SHELL SEEKERS. The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters. Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing. The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end. Don't buy it. In fact, it's hardly worth renting. Reread the book instead."
__label__2,"It works, it's cheap....: This is a sweet lil' 7-band EQ. No fancy features, no huge price tag. It's quiet, and does exactly what it's supposed to.For applications where you need more, an MXR 10 band EQ is the one to go for, but considering that this is 1/4 the price, it's always good to have one or two laying around. I'm using this one with an Ellis Stomp Box to cut the highs for more of a kick drum sound.EQ's are an essential part of any musicians arsenal, and these are cheapies you can use for applications where tweaking is needed more than full on tone shaping. This is my 4th or 5th F&C.; They're fairly reliable, but I had one of my cats pee on the old pedal, and now she's a goner. (Pathetic, but true)Pick one up, and one day you'll be glad you did."

__label__1,"Choking Hazard - Beware: My 10 month old has two teeth coming in on top and three on the bottom. He eats cheerios, gerber puffs, soft cooked vegetables and ripe fruit with very little problem. I tried the Earth's Best barley biscuits because he is prone to food allergies and I wanted to avoid wheat. Every time I gave him one of these biscuits (3 times) he was able to bite off too big a piece and gagged, not to the point of actually choking, but enough to send me into a panic watching him struggle and turn red. They don't seem to dissolve in his mouth fast enough. On the upside they taste good without being overly sweet. I think they are better suited for a little older babies who have more teeth and have really mastered chewing. I will try the Mum Mum rusks as a previous review suggested."

__label__2,"Good, not great...: You can find this tv at Costco for $250, which is an incredible price for a tv of this caliber... BUT, beware, unlike mentioned before, the quality is nowhere near HD, but if you're looking for a cheap, decent, ""big"" tv, then look no further. I'm pleased with mine except for the fact that it isn't HD ready, which I knew when I bought it, so that's my fault. If you are going to be watching a lot of DVD's as opposed to cable tv, then this tv is perfect; no matter if you have the color temperature setting at low or high.*EDIT*****I didn't know this TV came with component cable inputs. This means that this TV is much more deserving of 6 stars, rather than only 5. I've used the S-Video plug-in more times than my actual LCD monitor because it is almost like built-in anti-aliasing. Crystal clear picture that makes you just say, ""wow."" All my friends are jealous that this TV is part of my dorm room and they all come over to watch movies on it. It's that good."
__label__1,"Not enough Programmable Keys: This could have been a great remote. I bought it so that I could program it for remotes that are not included. Although it is programmable, it is limited to the number of buttons that can be programmed and this to me is a flaw on One For All part. I may sell this and get a real programmable remote."
__label__1,"Choose the seller!!: I bought it from marketplace seller ""Stay At Home Dads, We Know Games!!!"". It comes only disc in poor sleeve without package nor manual, and the disc was very suspicious. I return it."
__label__2,"much information, reads like a text book: There is much information about witchcraft in ancient Europe in this book, but it's no light reading. From scrolls found in early BC (how they were made and where they were found)to Demons in the ""today"" Christian Bible.

__label__1,hate the cover: I absolutely hate the cover for this album. Hard to explain. Bob has this look of a kid that I would wanna punch in the face for no reason at all. I'd just see someone with that face walking down the street and walk to him and sucker him.

Omg, I fell of the sofa laughing!After watching Blade Trinity (yuck!)

__label__1,"TEACHERS DON'T HAVE IT THAT EASY: Man, is this book depressing. While the book's primary focus is on the many problems facing teachers as a group which are revealed through a collection of short stories, it aptly addresses the bureaucratic issues that plague high schools across the country. Right when you start to feel totally depressed about your career choice as a teacher, the book (thankfully) sites examples of schools and school systems that are committed to providing greater opportunity and pay for its best teachers. Every teacher will see a part of themselves and their struggles in these stories."

How do you make the story relevent and up to date so that todays teen can relate to what happened in the Holocaust? Cherie Bennet and Jeff Gottesfeld have written the answer. Anne Frank and Me engaged my daughters attention from the first page and she finished it the same day. I also read it that same day. It is immensely readable and factual. It speaks todays teen letting them feel a part of a event that changed and rocked the world. Please read it and see for yourself.
__label__1,"Do u like scary movies?: When I first saw the movie I was totally in love with it. But that was in like what? 1997. Anyways, I still think its a really good movie, but not scary at all. The first time I saw it i did think it was, but after that I was like "" and why did I think this was scary?"" But the plot in the movie is really good and original. I also like how they make fun of other horror movies. This is one of the best teen/slasher flicks though. The Sequals are pretty good. I read someone else's review and I totally agree with them on how the third one probably wasnt the way Kevin wanted it to be. I would have like to see what he came up with as the last installment. But whatever, the guy who wrote it still came up with a good idea."

After a while people started to get curious, some of his readers tried to find out who he was. After he was foumd out it pretty much ruined his life. He lost his best friend/ secret crush. I really liked the book. It deals with alot of issues teens deal with today! I really enjoyed it, and I would deffinately reccomend this book."

Took some pictures with 430EZ flash using TTL and all pictures are washed out white. Canon said it's compatible with the EZ series flash but apparently not the case.Mail order shop told me that I can't exchange it for another one because two dead pixels on LCD screen is not categorized as defective. I don't remember paying $1K for something like this. Called Canon and they said I have to mail it to their repair center to get it fix under warranty.So, I bought the camera and haven't use it yet and it's costing me another $30 to ship it to get the LCD replace.

I think you got the big rock sound but I also think Joe demonstrates more diversity on this album than ever before. He's not afraid to stretch out and try different things. Maybe performer and producer both got what they wanted? One thing can not be debated. When it comes to blues or blues rock these days, there's Joe and then there's everybody else. A gifted performer since childhood, it's scary that Joe continues to get better and better."

When the set temperature is well below the air temperature (ie, furnace should remain off), it rapidly cycles the furnace in a strange way (just the compressor -- the burners don't light, and it's a continuous three-second cycle.) After discussing it with support, they claimed my furnace was at fault. Odd, considering that the old non-programmable thermostat was fine, as well as the replacement programmable thermostat (different brand.)I don't think it's a common issue, but Honeywell's claim that it could not be their product at fault annoyed me."

There was no tutorial as in the Rise of an Empire, so it really takes some time to figure out how to play the game. Needless to say I was disappointed with the purchase and would not buy the game if I had known this. But you will most definitely enjoy Rise of an Empire.

__label__1,Never AGain!!: I would never buy this clock again or recommend it to anyone! It is a bit tricky trying to figure out how to set it and figure out your time zone. But the main problem is that IT RESETS ITSELF ALL THE TIME!!! Both of my children have one and both clocks do it! It'll reset which time zone you are in which then changes your time - so then your alarm goes off either too early or too late! And it also randomly resets the alarm times! My 11 year old has woke up many mornings at 5am due to this and then of course you can't go back to sleep because you can't reset the stupid alarm clock! Very frustrating. We are trashing both clocks and buying a cheaper digital alarm clock. Never again!!

__label__1,"""Elegy for Reader"" is a more accurate title.: Though well written and fabulously voiced with vivid literary allusions, this book fails to be moving, or even meet its perceived goals and objectives. It is not an elegy for Iris, as the title implies, but a long, drawn out lamentation for poor author John Bayley. The book does a good job of making a chronicle of Bayley's and Murdoch's life together, but does not immortalize or draw sympathy for Iris. Bayley sadly neglects his wife's battle's with Alzheimer's Disease, lacking creativity and imagination in describing her endeavors and battle with the illness, and instead focuses on how great their past was. I am oh so impressed with Bayley's education and Iris's genius, but felt the book was condescending to the reader, unfocused, and a disgrace to the struggles of Iris and John under the harsh consequences of a deadly disease."

However, if you are not a geek like me, it is likely that you will find Linux Ugly, and hard to use. Solaris is just a no-no for a desktop user because it is even more frustrating than Linux. Mac OS on the other hand is in the class of its own. I am not going to start arguing what is best, but unless you are a Mac Lover, which as Howard Stern says are, ""last of a dying breed,"" then you are better off getting this product. Get the professional version though since it has desktop remoting and much more useful stuff. Now, why 2 stars?

And last but not least, the top 100 list has episodes of shows that didn't even last over the years. Only 3 Lucy episodes make it? Taxi actually ranks in the top 10 and Car 54 is on the list!

Simply put. I found some of the characters a little thin, but I think all in all the combination of Stone's unique lifestyle (what a house!) and his personality and Woods' plotting drive this book (my first by Woods) along very nicely and make up for the problems I have with the tome. As a matter of fact, I think Robert Crais' novels get a lot better review and that is not necessarily justified.

__label__2,"One of MGM's very best.: This film has never escaped my top ten favorites list. The only film in history to have 3 leading men nominated for best actor. While Gable is perfect as Fletcher Christian and Franchot Tone gives a superb performance as a midshipman, it's Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh that sets this film apart. You'll want to mutiny too. The ensemble cast is also memorable (unlike later films), each playing off Bligh's totally disgusting presence. Stolen cheeses, rancid rations and repeated lashings drive a crew collected by press-gangs to solicit 1st mate Christian to end their misery. And he does, casting Bligh adrift and taking the Bounty to Tahiti where half-naked island girls and a perfect tranquil life compare to Bligh like heaven to hell. I shed a tear every viewing during Tone's 'lift their hearts' speech at the end. This is a must see classic in every sense. Highest recommendation (for all but the youngest children)"

Danny is a thoughtful writer and a persistent drawer who merges the two into lessons for himself and us. I appreciate the insight, the nudge in the back, the lists, the suggestions,the inspiration.

He always captures the dilemmas facing troop commanders and gives us ordinary folks insights into the difficulties of fighting insurgents.This book was ruined by poor editing.

""Affect"" for ""effect"" and then vice versa. ""Caulk"" for ""chalk"". ""Wit"" for ""whit"". Perhaps they outsourced the editing to someone who doesn't speak English.The editing put this book in the category of bad fan fiction, which is widely available for free.

Beyond the great information that he lays out in very easy to follow passages, the book concludes as all good scholarly works do, with a sizable bibliography. This is what makes a good primer.

Endings of the songs - there are only 3 songs that have endings. The rest just ""fade out."" It gets very annoying having song after song fade out without any conclusive ending. 3 out of 11 is not very many.2. There are a few songs that introduce one theme and repeat it needlessly. Songs like ""Cuba Nova"" and ""Gotham"" have good ideas, but need more variation. And you guessed how they end - fade out.3. The entire album is a bit short - 47 minutes. That's a little more than half of what the CD can hold.I think Marc should have developed some of his ideas a bit more and come up with some memorable endings for the songs. This could be a 5 star CD; Marc's very talented (don't try to play along on the guitar - very hard), but the disc needs a little refining."

__label__1,"Sound spoils the Show: What should have been a wonderful overview of Linda Ronstadt's early career is ruined by poor quality mastering, which makes her gorgeous voice sound like she's singing through a brick wall. Looks like I'll have to fork out again for the Rhino records 2002 best of version which reportedly sounds much better. The same goes for Volume 2."
__label__2,"Kick Ass Pop Punk...: Catchy lyrics, sick riffs, and a band with a totally cool attitude, this, in my opinion, is their best to date, with their self titled in second and mo money mo 40'z in third. The only album from Mest that i didnt really like was wasting time, but it still wasn't that bad..."

__label__1,"I wish I could choose 0: I have yet to understand why so many people find this film amusing. Some have said that it was a modern day Animal House, and while I find Animal House uninteresting I think that is a serious dis to Animal House. I don't know it just seems that this movie continuously tries to be funny way to hard and ends up falling into a pile of its own crummy jokes. This movie is like a stitched together hybrid of every other ""guy"" film out there. I say guy film meaning, ""hey lets put some girls chest on the screen and it'll be an instant hit."" Well atleast its seems to have a lot of special features, so when you get tired of the film you can watch those instead. This is probably the only bad rating on here for this film but man, I've watched it once and that was more than enough."
__label__2,"Best TV show Ever!: This was about the best TV series NBC has had in years. It had everything. Action, drama, all of it. So glad to be able to watch it whenever I want now. Best episode was ""The Subway""."
__label__1,"makes one want to be a vegetarian: Julia Child was totally cold hearted about animals and indeed, how they were sacrified or slaughtered. Looking for meats for new recipes,she was delighted to come upon a rabbit soaked in its own blood. She had no qualms about cutting up a lobster while it was still alive.Her ""cookery"" obsession permeated her life and some of the pictures of France when she lived there are vivid. Julia too frequently peppers the text with French expressions, probably to reinforce how ""French"" she thinks she is. All the descriptions of the food, along with the constant reminders of her relentless bent for research and shopping, become tiresome. Julia Child is candid about who she is, but she is hardly likeable."
__label__2,"Great music. Especially for starters.: I got this box set when I first started listening to Pink Floyd. It is full of great music, especially the Early Singles. It is perfect if you are just starting your collection, because you get 8 albums all at once. And they are all grade A. Then you can get the rest as you go along."
__label__2,"My Book of Mean People: The is a terrific way for children to express their anger and fears about people who frustrate, control, threaten, tease, or ignore them - all with a sense of humor.

__label__1,STUPID STUPID STUPID: Thank you reviewer M. I had the exact same problem you did and did the exact same thing you did--I finally did a yahoo! search and found your review. You saved me from spending anymore time on this game. I removed it from my computer. thank you for posting.
__label__2,"Great WWII Submarine series: This was a great WWII submarine series to read. Pride Runs Deep, the first novel in the series sets the stage for the second novel, Sink the Shigure which picks up where this novel leaves off. They kept my interest all the way through."
__label__1,"TOTAL GARBAGE: I read all the reviews but thought I would try this bargain anyway. Well, the reviews are very accurate. Sure the picture is good and sound quality is decent - if you can get the stupid thing to play! From start the player did not work properly. It would get stuck, skip, etc. I had to play around with the remote for a while before it would work. In the car - FORGET ABOUT IT! Hanging verticall in the included case (as pictured on the box) the player would not work at all. It would just spin and spin continuously. Even when held on the lap at a 90 degree angle it would stall and skip. I just returned mine to Target for a full refund. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
__label__2,"Scissor sisters ta dah album: This is another brilliant album from the group, i have listened to the album most days since buying it, it's great even my husband likes it. They have some really upbeat songs to sing and dance along to, well worth it. Can't wait for the next one, BRING IT ON !!!"
__label__1,"Interesting as a historical slur: By the time this book was first published, the organization of Bavarian Illuminati was kaput. Robinson, who had never been invited to join, and who held a grudge against all secret organizations, slammed the illuminati both in England, where it had not taken root, and in America, where it was unknown. However, his preaching against it raised the specter of conspriacy which still hangs over the illuminati, although it is very long gone. His book in interetsing as an example of sucessful ropaganda, nothing more."
__label__2,Great Product: Even though it cost more it is worth the extra money. Gives you the flexability of any size cookbook; easy to store; easy to read with; looks good; Glad I bought it.

__label__2,"Great Book: This is a wonderful tribute to JFK jr. Lots of information about John, his life growing up and untill the end. Yes there is only one chapter dedicated to the days leading up to his death, and also the plane ride itself and what happened, why he crashed. How much do people want?? A whole book about the day he died would be stupid not to mention morbid. I would rather read about his life. Also, the author has a style of writing that is easy to understand, making the book interesting. I am so glad I got this book, and I will keep it on my shelf forever as a tribute to Americas son."
__label__1,Don't waste your time on this: My wife got one of these. Trying to open it was a nightmare. The chain broke off while we were trying to twist and pry it apart. Then once we had it open it wouldn't align to close.
__label__1,"This is a horrible movie: Man, was I let down by this. Opening up a high school text book and reading about Pocahontas is 100x more exciting than watching this movie. It's a good story but Terrence Malick has absolutely no idea how to tell it. This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen."

__label__1,"yep, it sucks: What is uo with this album? I mean Korn is coll but this album makes Korn look like a crappy band. Songs like Here to stay, got the life, blind, falling away from me are the worst of the whole album. They sing so horrible and it sounds like kidz bop. Stay away from this! Buy korn greates hits instead. If korn heard this album, they would tackle and punch any body who was involved in this."
__label__2,"It was a gift for someone difficult to buy for: I'll come back and modify if needed, but I got this for my dad who is very handy and has every tool and gadget and a garage full of stuff. He was fascinated with this when he opened it, and though he hasn't started building it yet, he seemed really happy with giving it a shot. For him to spend more than a minute checking out a gift is a huge win for me!"

__label__2,Very happy: Just used it on the beach for July 4th. Easy to transport. Was glad it had some weight. To me that means increased chance of durability. Easy to put up in minutes. One can do it but two easier. Attractive enough. Durable. Served its purpose very well. Was not able to see it perform in rain yet. Very worth the price.
__label__1,"Let's get real: What's with all the five star reviews? Wow. I'm going with two stars because this book is made for kids and does a good job at attracting kids with all its funny pictures. But come on. These are total common sense recipes. If you are getting it for the pictures and for kids to laugh, fine. But for cooking (even for kids), no way. And it is a cookbook rather than just another kids? picture book, right? Seriously, the recipe for ?Eat a Pita Pizza? is ?buy a package of pitas, jarred spaghetti sauce and shredded cheese. Put pitas on tray, put sauce on pitas, put cheese on pitas, put tray in oven at 350% and cook until cheese bubbles?. Now, do you really want to spend hard earned money on that? The recipes are really very insulting. Bam!"
__label__1,A Field Book of he Stars: I have been interested in Astronomy for a long time. This book is filled with great information regardingg the stars and different constellations. Unfortunately there are no plates or maps to go along with what is being said. With maps or plates of the different constellation would make the book a 4 or 5 rating on my list.
__label__2,"An intelligent solution to the postmodern christain mindset: It started out not like I predicted and re-educated me about the subtilties that are so engrained in our modern culture. Not many are able to write so readable but yet so intelectually about so much relavent truth. If you are serious about truth, it is a must read. If your are left wing or right wing or no wing this prolific reading will grip you! This book is full of Why we are here and what are the right questions and answers are for this age. David Breese is not preachy but just darn articulate and accurate. If you are a christain read this book. If you are a cousin of King Agrippa, don't be persuaded......just read this book!"
__label__2,"Good, but the natural wood one is better: The cord-wrapped handle is a great idea, offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip. My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice, particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken. This wrap really helps (though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place). The two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too. Though you really don't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original.It's still a fairly cheap piece of wood, compared to an ironwood version, but at this price (it was $9.99 when I bought it) you really can't go wrong. A nice enhancement over the basic bokken. I do, however, prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off. Nevertheless, if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended..."

Definitely recommend picking this one up!"

__label__1,"This CD stinks: For those of you expecting classic Carly Simon, don't buy this CD. It's awful. I can't believe how many wonderful reviews are here regarding this recording. These old re-hashed tunes do not mesh with her voice, and all seem to have the beat S-L-O-W-E-D down to a geriatric tempo that will send you to sleep. I gave my copy away to someone else who thought they might like it. I think it's gathering dust on her bookshelf."

__label__2,"It's good for small puppies - not big!: When I put my 8 week old golden retriever in it the first time, he climbed out! He put his paws on the side bars and got out and landed head first in his water dish. It also seems pretty dangerous for puppies if they get their paws caught, they could break their legs. As far as the quality - it was pretty good. The rubber pads on the bottom are pretty hard to put on and stay on. It did attach well to the crate that i have. It just seems too flimsy for a larger puppy - again, mine was only 8 weeks old at the time. I do think it is a great price for what you get!"
__label__2,I LOVE IT!: i love this movie so much and this comes with so many awesome things a whole book of info and pictures from the movie and backstage pictures aswell and a folder filled with letters from willy wonkas creators and the man who played willy wonka himself in script no less. and a case of some usefull stuff like pencils and eraser that look a bit like candy and the box it comes in is nice too :D oh and I HAVE A GOLDEN TICKET! yay :P
__label__2,"Great gift!: Got this for my mother for her birthday. She bought one 6 years ago when she visited the Pacific Islands and never used it all because it was hard to get...well, not hard to get on the internet! I bought this for her birthday and she LOVED it. Now she can use up that 6 year old bottle without fear.The bottle smells really good but I believe it is like perfume, once it touches your skin the fragrance changes. So this is probably not for everyone since the oils on their skin emanate a different odor."
__label__2,Pretty Good Chewable!: I recently has stomach surgery and was advised to get chewable vitamins and calcium. I got these even though I was wary of the lemon flavor. I thought they might be really tart. But I was pleasantly surprised that the flavor is very light and mild. They chew up quickly and are not hard on my newly operated on tummy. I will buy again.

__label__2,"Divine and beautiful: Well, it's as funny as everyone says :-). I read it. And re-read it. And seven years later, I'm still finding new jokes, and only yesterday did I finally understand the ending :-). I'm ashamed to admit it made me cry with happiness (or possibly hysteria). The astonishing amount of in-jokes and cultural references from Queen to Yeats make it absorbing reading and the morals and ideas crammed haphazardly in make it something of a classic. The prose is skillful and pretty, but what I enjoyed most about this book was its warmth and humanity. The characters are simply delicious, and I defy anyone not to fall in love with Crowley and Aziraphale, who are adorable seperately and perfect together ;-). In the end, I found the book simply uplifting - I'm afraid I flatly disagree with those who found the ending ""a disappointment"". Bittersweet, hilarious, powerful and poignant - very, very human. It's ineffable, dear boy, don't you know? :-)"
__label__2,Just what we wanted: Very quick delivery. Use both the intake and exhaust settings.This fan really help move the cool evening air into the house. We use the exhaust setting in the morning to remove the dog smell.
__label__2,"Very randy!: Austin just makes me laugh harder and harder as the movie kept going. The funniest movie I've ever seen. If you're in the mood for comedy, this is the movie to get.

__label__1,"Nothing much to say: Saw this last night.....Could have possibly thought it was ""ok"" but not necessarily my cup of tea until the very last 5 minutes of the film. HORRIBLE. JUST HORRIBLE.First movie that I can honestly say I wish there were a no star option here."

__label__1,"Toilet Seat: I ordered 2 white toilet seats, both had slightly different connectors and both seats slide sideways even after retightening the plastic tension nuts. I do not recommend these. I'm sorry I purchased them as they dont stay very well. I thought with the metal attachment bolts they would hold and not move side to side. There should have been better attachment hardware. Update 3-20-09, both seats have broken. On one the plastic bumper under the seat broke and the other totally cracked. The price can easily be beat at Lowes or the Home Depot. I just bought a better fitting seat for 20 dollars."
__label__1,"Cool baby daddy poetry--where are the blood and guts?: The poetry is clean, no doubt, and the poet is talented, but I couldn't help but ask the question, ""Who cares?"" When it was light, it was ticklish and not moving, and I never found it dark. Slick, yes--the book was slick, too slick. It must've been a slow year for the Bakeless Prize, for this manuscript to have won it. It seems that, if the author were to focus on the depth of his humor, and on the depth of his ""intellectual statement,"" future efforts might exceed this one considerably--for, again, I repeat that he IS talented. Right now, though, he is irrelevant."
__label__1,"Looking for something else: This product is advertised as a ""sound reducing"" device. It is not. It does absolutely nothing dampen surrounding noise. Massive disappointment for someone who bought them to shut everyone around me up."
__label__2,"Best Cd I have ever purchased: This was the best 13 dollars i have ever spent, the whole CD is throughly enjoyable. All the songs are deeply metaphoracle with a dark mellow twist to them. Orestes, Brena, and Magdelene are a few of my favorites. The Cd is so fun to listen to because not only is it catchy but its fun to interpret they lyrics. APC is great for any mood!"
__label__1,"Weird: I rather generously gave this CD 2 stars due to the talents of the best in the genre. My argument is that the sountrack is somewhat between pseudo-authentic and slick Nashville. I do not believe that the majority of the soundtrack was consistent with the tenor of the film. There is a plethora of music available that is good old-timey or slick made to sell. This seemed like a hodgepodge thrown together because some people believe that a soundtrack must accompany a movie. I realize that tracks containing cylinder recordings of authentic British Isles music would be a hard sell. I think the CD should be entitled ""Contemporary Adaptations of Original Folksongs"". At least that would be more honest. After viewing the film, my expectations of the CD were not realized."
__label__1,Aerial Gunner: Typical of the war movies of that age. Very much the Americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice. I enjoyed looking at an America that was. Would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life.

When the kettle has water in it that&#146;s boiling really high, during pouring, the water comes shooting out of the spout in an impossible to control manner.

I do, however, like it&#146;s funky style."

__label__2,"Inspiration: It might not be the best cd out there and to quote him he ""may not be the best singer in the world"" but I think that it is still good he gave it a shot. This whole thing may be a joke and if indeed it is that record company should be ashamed for making fun of such and innocent guy who just likes to sing, but if he truly takes it seriously and so does the record company, that's great!! I think he had a lot of courage to do what he did and if it's a joke that's just wrong and terrible, but congratulations William!!And, also, I mean, he was really nice to everyone who bought the cd. He said thanks sincerely and wished everyone good luck in whatever they do. How much sweeter/nicer can you get than that?? Good job William!! Thanks!!"

__label__1,"Really bad, but it's quite amusing.: This attempt to cash in on the success of Lucio Fulci's Zombie (which itself was an attempt to cash in on the success of Dawn of the Dead) turns out to be a very silly and badly directed, but still quite amusing gorefest. Ian McCulloch is in this one, and he and Alexandra Delli Colli head to some jungle island to investigate a cannibalistic tribe. The gore is the movie's selling point, and the effects range from surprisingly good to hilariously awful, and the lovely Delli Colli does look quite alluring in the buff (note: she appeared about three years later in The New York Ripper, and somehow looked a dozen years older in that one!)"
__label__1,"Good but arrived chipped: I actually do not hate it, just it arrived broken, it had a big chip out of the rim. I will look for another one similar but directly in a store as this item is not sturdy enough for the mail."
__label__2,"Discover a relatively unknown composer: I heard the ""Cobblers on the Heath"" on FM radio and was instantly bowled over by the clever music with great melody and orchestration. Instant smash hit with me so I got online with ecom and was delighted to find this CD. Absolutely beautiful! It is a treat to discover a new classical composer who can get my jaded old ears to perk up! Orchestral playing is everything you need it to be - I will enjoy becoming familiar with the other works on the CD but I admit ""Cobblers"" is a gem! A small masterpiece!"
__label__1,"Cheap!: I purchased two of them for my courtyard wall. After only a few summer months, the top panel one one of them is tarnished. The bottom mounts on both lights are splitting. I would not recommend buying these lights."
__label__2,"Bring it Back: Perennial Gardening (American Garden Guides) is one of my favorite garden books. It is concise, accurate, extremely well illustrated,and does not confuse the reader with excessive information. I am a horticulturalist and the Head Grower for a 60 acre wholesale container nursery. I have been responsible for growing perennials for over 20years. Often I am ask to speak to retail customers or the general public. This is my most highly recommended book for people first starting to develop a perennial Garden."
__label__2,"Good CD: The CD is worn but I knew this when I bought it.This guideline is making mw add 8 more words. This should let us put in how many WE want, not what thety want."
__label__2,"Billy is the Best: Billy Cobham's ""Total Eclispe"" is the single reason I began listening to jazz music and not just rock and blues. I bought ""Billy's Best"" and Billy's other ""Best Of"" fifteen years ago and can only say they are superb. I usually do not like best of albums; however, this was all you could get of Cobham back then. Now they are putting all of his stuff out again, and ""Spectrum"" is a must along with ""Total Eclispe"", ""Funky side of Things"", and I liked ""Picture This"", and ""Powerplay"". However, be careful not to get the same songs if you buy the best of type cd's and the original set. I have played some serious drums since 1971 myself, and can only say Billy is the best!"

But still, you cannot deeny how much Nirvana carried the music world in the 90's. When Cobain commited suicide in '94 (RIP), the music world was lost,and was carried by only 2 or 3 good bands."
__label__1,No directions for the hanger. Confusing: Brushes are ok. But the main part is to get the Camelbak dry. Not helpful.
__label__2,"Very funny movie: This is a very funny movie which pokes fun at religion, sexism, moderism and war. The poor Bushman who finds a coke bottle which fell out of an airplane must travel to the end of the world to get rid of this evil thing. This evil thing is believed to come from God and causes evil things to happen to people who have it. On the way of getting rid of it he happens to meet a man who has hard luck with woman. (One of the best scenes in the movie is when his four wheeled drive jeep gets stuck up a tree). He also meets a strange woman who has trouble with men. At the end of the movie these three people end up saving children from a group of soldiers who want to overthrow a government. How they save the children is also funny."

__label__1,"Wanted to like it but didn't: This is the first Joe Pickett book that I've read and will most likely be the last. I usually try to start reading a series at the beginning but this was the first book that I could find on audio. I liked the Wyoming detail but that was about all. Joe seems to be a superhero who gets no respect from anyone even his flaky mother-in-law. The guy chases down bad guys single handedly then goes home to cook and wash dishes for his family. At one point in the story the author has a Yorkshire terrier jumping over huge snow drifts while the owner is carrying another dog, a Cocker Spaniel. Come on. Yorkie is way too small and Cocker is way too big for what happened in the story to have really happened. I finished listening but if I'd been reading I would have stopped right there. Ending was terrible."
__label__2,"I like it: The projector works just fine. Don't know why others are saying negative things about it??? Easy to focus. Yes, you need a dark room but complete darkness is not necessary. Easy to find a replacement bulb at any home improvement store for under $7.00."

I installed it and it kept shutting down when trying to start it, but with the advice another ecom reviewer I was able to get it to work upon clicking during the intro.This program is not just for kiddos! The unusual tools allow you to do fun things with the media by double clicking over, for example, the crayon once you have selected it... it becomes a wacky melted crayon which you can do some cool things with.Once you have created fun or psychadelic images, you can actually export them and use them as artwork. Makes for snazzy computer desktop artwork!Even in spite of the troubles with opening the program sometimes, it's definately worth it!"
__label__2,"The Best Handheld Game Ever Made!: What's not to like?? This is the BEST portable game machine ever made! It's more compact, and so easier to take along, then the Nintendo DS. There are a ton of games made for it and most of them are good for hours and hours of fun! There are many games for the GBA that have player's guides which make the game super fun to play. This latest version of the GBA has even a brighter screen then the earlier models. Even my 59 year old eyes can see this screen with it's bright, beautiful colors. I'm still buying new games and there are so many used ones that can be had at a great price. The Pearl Blue edition is really slick looking and there are also hot colors like the Ruby Red one I got for my daughter. If you like video games this is the player to get, you won't be sorry!"
__label__2,"FUN BALL WITH FUN RATTLE SOUNDS: My baby took a little time to like this ball -- he doesn't pay that much attention to the tags, but now he likes the big soft ball to wrestle with ocassionally and he likes the jingley-rattley sounds. He is not interested in rolling it. He has a favorite tag, but doesn't focus too much on the tags. He enjoys it mostly when I hold a tag and dangle the ball around by his face making it make noise and sort of make it bounce-bounce-bounce (like dribbling the ball while holding the tag) ... he also likes when I through it way up in the air and catch it ... maybe he will eventually like playing with it himself when he's older (he's 10.5 months old).

And I think the times when he does play with the tags it is good for his motor skills and exploration of the differences in the tags."

__label__2,"Poor little rich girl: This is the famous story of the custody battle for little Gloria Vanderbilt, recreated with an all-star cast. When Gloria was a baby, her father (Christopher Plummer) died, and her underage mother was unable to manage her inheritance. Lawyers took over that job until Gloria was ten; then her aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (Angela Landsbury), sued for legal custody claiming the mother was morally unfit. The trial was a huge scandal in 1934, and the outcome did little to boost Gloria's confidence. She felt unloved and unwanted until middle age, never reconciling with her mother.The opulent homes and beautiful costumes and sets create a real sense of the era, when, at the height of the depression, the little heiress inherited $2.5 M. This is a fascinating look at a real-life soap opera.Kona"
__label__1,"Bait and switch: Don't waste your money thinking you are getting the original recordings. Most are poorly recorded live performances or re-recordings that don't hold a candle to the original. I have had this with other artists in the past and was sorely disappointed. The phrase ""ripped off"" comes to mind. All of these compilations should say definitively whether or not they are the originals."

__label__1,"What's up with the Score?: I should have listened to Harry from Ain't It Cool News. He warned fans that the music was differant on the DVD. But I thought he meant the songs. Losing the rights to songs, and putting different songs in their place for home video is nothing new. But it is the entire score that is different. And the new score is mind numbingly horrible. It completely ruins the movie. There is also a voice over narration at the beggining of the film that I don't remember being there in the theatrical or VHS version. And even more strange, is that when you switch over to the French language track, it is still the original score. This makes no sense at all. Warner Bros. really messed up with this one. I hope they re release it with the proper score. In the meantime, since I know Circuit City won't refund mt money, I'm going to see if Warner Bros. will."

__label__1,"Lacking depth or real interest...: The first thing one notices about ""The Cell"" is that it feels as if Stephen King is out of touch with not just his readers, but, popular culture as a whole. The dialogue is jarringly unnatural. Stephen King is a master craftsman and writes well, but the characters lack depth and motivations for their behavior. It's as if the author decided he could and would write anything and people would buy it. He's right. We did, but we didn't like it.Upon finishing the book, you feel as if you turned off the television. There is no lasting impact or even a feeling of satisfaction. There was no difficulty, it was easy to read, but unsatisfying at the same time.I do not recommend this book to fans of Stephen King or anyone else. He's off his game or he just doesn't care... Either way, read something else."

The graphics are stellar, the cinematics were well done and the controls are pretty easy to learn, but when it comes to actual gameplay, there is a lack there of. The game consists of four discs of little more then repetive cgi movies. You control a women who never speeks on camera but supposidly does off. You are forced to trek back and forth to the same spots over and over again killing the same monsters in the same spots the same way each time. 90% of the time you will have no control of what is going on and just sit back and watch. And for every little thing your character does, open doors, pick up an item and so on, you are forced to watch a quick cut scene, Everytime. It gets very old very fast. For those who actualy like to play games rather then look over your friends shoulder and watch, look elsewhere. Don't even bother with this coaster."

Like so many others posting here, I can only go 6 to 12 feet before having to remove the bump head cover (not easy!), rewind the line, then reinstall the bump head cover. And getting that cover to snap back in place is even more frustrating than getting the damn thing off in the first place! I'd return it but I dont know what I'd buy to replace it. I dont get along with 2 cycle engines (i've sworn to never own another). The motor on my old electric Ryobi gets so hot it burns my ribs so electric is out too. So its either 4 cycle or let the grass continue to grow across the side walk. Someone told me Honda makes a 4 cycle but I've been afraid to even look at the price."

Well, I was WRONG!This movie has more twists than you expect, and it's twisty right from the start. The book (by the way) is excellent as well, and the movie does a great job sticking to the plot of the book. I saw the movie first, then read the book, and I could not get Ed Norton's voice out of my head, they're THAT close.It makes you think, it makes you jumpy, it makes you want to go make soap, and perhaps blow something up. Mostly it makes you think. And maybe watch it, oh, seventy times more so you can catch everything.P>Do yourself a favor, WATCH THIS MOVIE! You *will* like it, I promise.

It is painful to watch fine actors and actresses like Dan DAILEY, Eli WALLACH, Diane BAKER and Susan STRASBERG completely miscast.The only good moment comes from a striking performance by Paul NEWMAN as a dumb ""has been"" battler, hardly recognizable under heavy make-up."

This ""Nevada"" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like ""History"", ""Culture"", ""Economy"" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. The ""Culture"" section is especially good and is very inclusive.This book, as well as the entire ""Portrait of America"" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."

The only thing I really dislike about the series as a whole is the Tamrissa, Vallant thing. Tamrissa gets annoying after a while. But the rest of the characters are great and I love the detail put into her writing."
__label__2,The trick with this is to follow it up with a wire slicker brush.: This is a great brush for really loosening the loose hairs from your pet. But you will need to remove the hairs from the cat with a wire slicker brush. Otherwise you'll have clumps of loose fur that get all over your stuff. My kitties are so silky and shiny after I brush them with this and my boy cat LOVES it. He comes running when I get it out and rolls around on the floor and purrs hard while I brush him. The other kitty it a little brat so I have to pin her down by the scruff to brush her. Whatever. I even bought this as a gift for a friend when he got his first cat because it's so great! It gets rid of SO MUCH FUR IT'S CRAZY!!!!!!

Sure lots of western genres play on the common theme of rancher and farmer feuds but this movie has a very visceral and heartfelt sincerity to it.

The manufacture will not fix the problem and recommended a seamtress in the area to get it fixed. Wow this must mean they get this issue a lot. The seams came out below the ladder and created a big hole and let the air out. Thank god my three and two year old were not at the top when this happened.

__label__2,Very Funny: I enjoyed the series on PBS in the early eighties (I believe it was filmed in the late seventies). It easily surpasses the typical TV sitcoms in comedic value. The actual rating should be four and a half stars. The only problem is that I cannot find the series on tape anywhere.Another viewer stated that this tape contains the first three shows; that is incorrect--this tape contains the first show only.
__label__1,Do not get this.: This is a very low budget pilot. Only get if you are a hardcore fan. The animation is very obviously meant to just convey a story and isn't very pleasing to the eye. The rest of the episodes in Torchwood are live action.
__label__1,"Find a better book: This book is comprehensive, yes, but the explanations are poor. I find his writing style difficult to follow. The book is poorly edited as well, for example, the second chapter introduces datapath logic cells and then immediately goes into a multipage treatise of multiplier architecture. Interesting information but it seems much out of place given the context. The problems are not very helpful either. Often you will need to search for information outside of the text in order to complete the question. The author obviously knows the subject well, I just don't think he does a very good job of teaching it."

How many billionaires, when attacked, would choose to sit naked in a hallway for days without taking action? I tried and tried but couldn't get past page 80, when the heroine starts her raunchy sex with NOT the hero she's met on page 23 but some big hung lay she keeps on the back burner. I tossed this book in the trash. NOT worth even passing on to a friend. My friends read ROMANCE... even when it's raunchy, it's romance. Just not my taste in novels.

__label__1,"Bored: This is my first go around with an Anita Blake novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. I thought the novel's sense of place was very poorly done, and wonder how much field research was actually done on location before the book was written. Anita Blake alludes to the Sange del Cristo mountains, when the common term for them is Sangre _de_ Cristo. A fine point, admittedly, but that's what they're called. That, and an allusion to good Mexican food, is about as far as the background research goes here.In spite of the juicily gory hospital scene, the pace of the novel's early stages was almost glacial. And finding that I cared not a whit about any of the characters, not even Anita, I put this one down.But I did give the first novel in the series a quick look, and it did catch my interest, so maybe the ennui that seemed to permeate ""Butterfly"" is more due to Anita Fatigue than anything else. It would seem to me to be a difficult thing, to write about the same character(s) book after book."

__label__2,"Great Idea but no customer service: This was a great toy until it started developing problems. There is something wrong with the on/off so that the battery energy drains unless you use a screwdriver to remove the battery panel then take the batteries out after each use. This is not exactly convenient. Secondly, the ""on"" doesn't work half the time. Repeated calls to customer service are fruitless (no one answers and no one returns the calls). The pages of the books also rip, and the pen can get stuck in the hinge. In addition, one of the books also was misaligned in printing so that if you point to certain items, it thinks you are indicating something different. (You have to guess where to point the pen.) Believe me, it's alot simpler to pick up a book and teach my child the information in this book than to use this frustrating toy."

She hasn't gone with Bocelli (she never will, either).

Writing in Flow has lots of quotes by literary writers, mystery writers and poets like Carolyn See, Jane Smiley, Faye Kellerman, Marvin Bell, Billy Collins and Mark Strand. These writers talk about how they get into flow, how they dissolve writers' block, how they focus in, and how reading others work gets them writing. If you like reading inspiring books about writing, add this one to your shelf."

__label__2,"Fair, Balanced and Fascinating: Overtime is a great look back it this election. For me, it was interesting to go back and put the whole campaign/election in perspective from start to finish. It's also nice to read a book like this that seems to be written from a non-partisan viewpoint. Sabato presents both sides of all the issues and is equally critical of both campaigns. In about 12 years when my son is taking his high school civics class and needs a topic for a book report or paper - I will dust off this book and hand it to him. On a side note, I recently saw Mr. Sabato speak at a conference I attended. If you ever get the chance, go see him! He is very informative and quite humorous."
__label__2,"very nice: A lot of people seem to adore this translation. I think it's nice, but there are several I like better. The unusal thing about this one is the very terse, unelaborated language used, which seems to charm a lot of people, but just puts me off. Long-winded translations can go astray, but they don't have to, by any means. (The alleged advantage of using fewer words seems to be based on some pseudoscientific language fetish I'll never understand [see below reviews].)Of course, let's not forget to mention Needleman's terrible introduction. Absolute garbage. He shows no knowledge of Chinese history or philosophy, and you can just see the square (Eastern) blocks being forced into round (Western) holes as he tries to expound on Taoist philosophy. Henricks does a much better job in his intro, with fewer words, and sounds less presumptuous in doing so.Just ignore the Needleman, though, and you'll probably appreciate this translation, perhaps more than any other."

__label__1,"Snapped after a month!: It was a great month - these headphones have excellent sound and bass. I loved them. But they snapped in exactly the same place as the previous two reviewers had them snap, and mine only after a month! On closer examination, it is indeed a poorly designed pair of headphones - the plastic is extremely thin at precisely the place where the headphones experience the most pressure from pushing against your head.I thought perhaps I just had a big head, but after looking at these other reviews, it appears I'm not alone. Or we all have big heads.In any case, stay away from these headphones!"
__label__2,"Wow! Are They Really Sugar Free?: I bought these for my hubby for his birthday. He was recently diagnosed with diabetes and I know the hardest thing to give up was his regular chocolate bar. He wouldn't buy any because all the sugar free purchase he's made so far just don't taste good. But I have seen reviews for this brand before and the sugar free rated very well. I didn't plan to even try one though since I don't like and I don't need sugar free products but he talked me into it because he said they were really very good. That got me into trouble because the next day I ate most of the remaining ones leaving him just a couple! Now I have to make it up to him and get him some more. I can't believe they are sugar free. The taste is incredible. They just melt in your mouth. I will never buy Godiva again, these just taste so much fresher like good chocolate I remember from when I was a kid when my father was based in Germany."
__label__1,"Disappointing.: This book is 482 pages long, and the second half of it is not Lightwave-(or even 3D)-specific: general concepts of animation like follow-through, squash-and-stretch, etc. Everything in this section has been said before, and more eloquently, in many other books on the topic of animation.The first half (which IS Lightwave-specific) is a step-by-step tutorial for building a rather esoteric IK rig for a humanoid character. I didn't find it helpful--nothing in the exercises seems designed to expand the reader's understanding, it's just a recipe for reconstructing Albee's rig. I suspect any reader without a previous understanding of how bones work in Lightwave will be completely frustrated.If you're a beginner looking for a technical resource to animating in Lightwave, this is definitely *not* it. Any potential buyers should browse through a copy before buying this."
__label__1,"Piece of Junk: Do not waste your time or money on this product. The magnet is attached to the back of the holder with only double sided sticky tape. Even with a partial roll of paper towels (only 10-12 left on the roll), the holder separated from the magnet. This did not happen when I was pulling on it, but in the middle of the night, while it was ""just holding"" the roll! I also had to be very careful about pulling off a towel because I pulled the whole holder off the fridge (this was before it separated from the magnet). What a waste. I would have given this product a ""zero"" star rating if that had been an option."
__label__1,"Beware of the Kindle edition...: I was excited to have something worthwhile in the realm of a harmony of Kings, Chronicles and Samuel. I eagerly downloaded this eBook and was immediately disappointed. It simply contains the text of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. Nothing from the author at all. I am not sure if this is an oversight on the part of the publisher/author or if it was intended. The hard copy edition may be very useful, but the Kindle edition is nothing more than the beloved Scriptures (including only Samuel, Kings, Chronicles) that you more than likely already have in every room of your home. I would not suggest it in it's current form."

__label__1,"How to Talk to a Labeler...: This book is typical of the obtuse rantings of her ilk. What is scary is that half of America thinks that ""liberal"" is a bad word.Like Coulter, George W. himself vilifies ""liberals"" in one breadth and then expounds on the virtues of ""liberty"" in another. Folks, these two words are more closely related than conjoined twins. Both are derived from the latin word ""liber"" which means ""free."" Therefore, a ""liberal"" is one who ""has or aspires to have liberty.""Thomas Jefferson, FDR, John F. Kennedy, Walter Cronkite and Martin Luther King were all liberals. Even Abraham Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party, had liberal views on the liberal issue that slaves should be free.Before right-wing apologists (Coulter, et al) pick a label, they should open a dictionary and see what the word really means."

It did not work out of the box but unfortunately was past the 30 day period when it was tested out. One would not expect a basic tape deck to not be able to play or record cassettes, but it appears to be a fairly common problem with a sensor in the unit. We are now trying to deal with a service center in another state and are out money for shipping on a brand new unit. Poor experience with Onkyo."

I watched it with my friend's children...and lets just say we watched the DVD over and over again...I even started to memorize the lines.Gigi is funny and very interesting, and the lessons are biblical. The focus is on serving God in everything we do, and having fun doing it!

__label__2,"Gorgeous: This single, with all four of its songs being phenomenal Goo Goo Dolls hits, is great as both a sample of what they are capable of and as a small chronology as well. There are four songs here, each one from a different album. ""Here Is Gone"" comes from their 2002 release of Gutterflower, and wonderfully captures the level of emotion they creat in their songs. ""Burnin' Up"" from 1995's A Boy Named Goo is a great punk-grunge song by Robby. ""We Are the Normal"" from Superstar Car Wash is a wonderful anthemic power-pop masterpiece. Finally, ""Two Days In February"" from Hold Me Up is one of their earliest acoustic ballads, and it's a beautiful one. I highly reccommend this CD for people who are just discovering the Goo Goo Dolls, and for hardcore fans or collectors who are interested in obtaining new artwork."
__label__2,"Very Enjoyable selection.: 'The Girl with Orange Lips' sung by Dawn Upshaw, backed with a rather eclectic colleciton of musicians, is the kind of album Ms. Upshaw should really be doing. Like 'White Moon', it is a collection of unusual songs from far corners of 20th century repitoire, rather than an essay on the more familiar material which is done so well by the heavyweights such as Renee Fleming, Anne Sophie von Otter, and Cecilia Bartolli, not to mention songs of the modern European and American stage owned, in my mind, by Ute Lemper.Unlike another reviewer, I really prefer 'White Moon' to this album on a visceral level, although I listen to both at least once a year.My only criticism is that as original DVD releases go, it seems a bit short, but this only reinforces the fact that I would like to hear more of Ms. Upshaw do this material in a single shot."
__label__2,"Superb deal: In these tough times I downgraded from the AT440 to the AT120, at half the price, and was amazed at the improvement. Granted by that time the needle on my 440 was ground down so far I was basically playing with the cantilever...ouch. The 120 has a slight treble bite, and bit of extra bass energy, not quite as flat, extended or detailed as the 440, and that may be very conducive to a lot of systems, a good eq for rock. A very pleasant sound, still lots of air and detail, tracks well and low noise. If you listen to a lot of records, and it's hard to justify more than $90 for just a year or two of listening, I would definitely choose this over the 440.Compared to either AT cartridge, the Grado black, which is the other cartridge on hand at the moment and very nice, has a slightly pronounced midrange and subdued treble I think."
__label__1,"Not worth it: This is not a ""fat burning"" yoga session. If you want a strenuous, Ashtanga workout, try Bryan Kest. If you want a contemplative, relaxing session, try Crunch ""Candlelight Yoga"". Skip this one. I actually became bored and angry watching this dud."
__label__2,"Aptly named...: Bella is a ""beautiful"" little film, and not just in name. Its soft, quiet, understated declaration of passion about life-sized problems that don't have neat, tidy answers is a breath of fresh air. The last quarter of the film almost carries the subtlety too far, but it pulls out just before the crash and burn. I love the way Eduardo Verstegui tells the story without preaching. Even though diverse opinions are portrayed about such things as guilt, work ethics and abortion, the viewer can understand and relate to everyone involved. It's so much like how life really happens, sometimes, they could have called it ""Bellissima"", but that wouldn't have made such a great name for a little girl. Caveat: Watch with a box of tissues."

Natalie Wood, Liz Taylor, Mickey Rooney, Shirley--- There are great child actors out there, but you won't find one here, and being the essence of the plot, it's lack sinks the ship.George has got to go back to the Drawing board, this movie only sports top notch animation. Its not fit for human consumption."

It is about the best animal book and here is why: Kate DiCamillo is a award winning author and all she writes is worth reading - trust me. It is about a girl who finds a dog and names it Winn-Dixie.

Zinn places the good and the bad of American expansionism to the page for all to read. No shameless cheerleader for patriotism, Zinn makes you work for your love of country. In order to really understand the true nature of what it means to be an American, one must face the trials and missteps that we took.

__label__1,"Something less than Gone With the Wind...: This movie was made in the 1960s and it shows. Though intended as a comedy, the first half of the movie isn't especially funny. Only the auto chase scenes at the end are worth seeing and, at that, tend to be rather frivolous. However, as always Natalie Wood looked great and Tony Curtis was very at home in his part which was similar in style to several of his other roles. The plot is faintly reminiscent of a Doris Day/Rock Hudson movie of similar vintage."

I'm not sure what state this was in though. So there's no ""Mr. Park"". haha. The TWO frontmen are named Chester Bennington (singer) and Mike Shinoda (rapper).Also...Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and Meteora are NOT CD singles, they're 3/4 of the main CDs that Linkin Park has made. The 4th one is Live In Texas. ""Somewhere I Belong"" is a song ON the CD Meteora.

I found it in the comedy section of my video store and I expected a movie like Raising Arizona - something cute and enjoyable.After I saw the first scenes with Cameron Diaz being roughed up in the back of the car I thought this will be a great movie (a sleeper) or this will be the worst movie ever made - not sure which - so I decided to see the rest of it. Since I had never heard of it before I expected the latter. I was right!This movie ranks with classic worst movies such as UTurn and The Farmer. Truly bad - someone needs to revoke this guy's directorial license. Also I always thought of Vincent D'Onofrio as a quality actor - what's that ""rocking back and forth and flapping his arms"" acting technique he's using? He does it the whole movie!

There also is a person named GT who owns the `Welcome Stairway"". Hope and Addie both work and live at the ""Welcome Stairway"". The main plot is around that GT is running for mayor against the current mayor Eli Millstone.I personally didn't like the book because it never held onto one subject.

I love him--the color, the dancing, the whole singing, blooming, fuzzy overdoneness of his musicals, and, yes, I'm a sucker for love, too. It's not because I'm a woman. My husband loves Luhrmann and loves it that people fall in love, albeit tragically in Romeo and Julet and Moulin Rouge. This is a great collection. Strictly Ballroom is a premier feel-good movie, but it's also a brilliant take on the Hollywood musicals of the 50's. Romeo & Juliet is a bold reconstruction of how Shakespeare wrote his plays: full of hyperbole, often to the point of bombast. Shakespeare used the popular songs of his day and also had a lot of violence in his plays. He wasn't writing for college professors, but to the ordinary people of his time. Shakespeare wasn't highbrow in the 16th century, and Luhrmann doesn't make his R&J highbrow. Moulin Rouge is over the top, but, as I said, either you like it or you don't"

Her descriptions of Hannah's childhood, of Claris's first romance are full of detail that rings true to my own experience. Her description of a small town on the Maine coast also rings true - as if you could visit Dundee this summer and be right at home there. The story is fast-moving, a real page-turner. I had to put it down deliberately so that it wouldn't be over too soon. I have read all of Ms. Gutcheon's books and enjoyed every one, but this one may be my favorite."

I know its a kids show but the voice acting is horribly annoying, they re-use the same animation sequences over and over, and the plot, well, its ahh...really ...really ...stupid. Advise to rent disk one before buying the whole set(s). Make sure you still enjoy it as an adult. Oh yeah, Thundercats is the same story, not as cool as you remember."
__label__1,"Lame, Dumb, Waste of Money and Time: Don't even bother watching it. Glade i didn't waste my money to see this in theaters. I was extremely disappointed. The preview made the movie look good, where as a whole it was just awful. Reminds me of Lions for Lambs, both were awful and pretty pointless."
__label__2,"charming: This album is a must-have for any nature and music loving family. Short, simple songs are perfect for a variety of ages, even my little one who doesn't love music."
__label__2,"Rock solid: When I first heard these guys a few years ago, I was impressed with some of the songs. And with the lead singer being related to Jonathan Davis of KoRn, I thought it couldnt be bad.This is one solid rock album. Great energy; makes ya just want to crank up the volume and headbang. With the lead song ""Unstable"", and the rest of the line up of hard rock mixed with a few slower tunes, this album is definately a must have."
__label__2,"2000 BMW 323i sport wagon: I have purchased Curt hitches in the past for my earlier BMWs (E30s mainly) so I figured when I got my E46 it was time to get a hitch for it as well.ecom had the best price by quite a bit online (As usual) so I ordered it, and began to install. everything is included to install the hitch except a drill and wrenches, very basic and common tools.it installed easily and without hassle which was very nice.it feels solid and I have pulled 1000 pound loads without problem, and the hitch is rated for more than 1,500 (2,000 is fine on the E30).the only problem I have with this hitch is the included reciever style ball holder does not work with sport package cars, it touches the lower valance and could potentially hurt the finish.curt makes another part number that fits correctly, and they will send it to you if you tell them that the included part does not work.remember to buy a hitch ball otherwise you won't be towing anything with this well constructed hitch."
__label__2,"Great Re-Vamp of One of the Best Comics Ever: I like many was a bit skeptical about a color edition: would it be worth re-buying a book I already owned just for some color and a few tweaks? Would I like the colorist's work? Honestly though, they did a great job. I love black and whIte comics as a rule but this series really shines in color because the style of coloring was appropriate to the lineart and added to the story instead of being a distraction. Also a few touched up panels doesn't hurt.Bottom line is: if you love SP and don't mind shelling out some more money for the series it's totally worth it. This comic adapts surprisingly well to color."
__label__1,"OK: I thought I was buying the regular brush size, it seemed that way in the description, instead I got te travel size (???)"
__label__2,"Great, only thought is they are a bit small.: Only chose 4 star as opposed to five due to the fact they are a little small. Love the fact I was able to locate this design."
__label__1,Meh: The chairs are cute but the feet don't sit evenly on the ground which is annoying because they're wobbly when you sit on them. Also there was a rip in the chair cushion when I pulled it out of the box. The chairs are cute to look at but overall the quality was a disappointment.
__label__1,"Very Heavily Scented: If you are at all sensitive to fragrances, this product is not for you.I washed only one load of laundry in my brand new HE washer using Tide ""Original Scent"". Even though I used half of the recommended quantity of powder, the fragrance was so strong when I took the clothes out of the washer that I ended up washing the entire load two more times, without detergent, to reduce the smell. After the third washing, there was still enough scent left on the laundry that I could tell which towels had been in HE washer, and which ones were done in my old washer the day before using unscented liquid detergent.After doing some research on-line, I found Sear's fragrance-free HE powder. I have done several loads of laundry using it, and am happy with the results. It does a decent job cleaning the clothes, and they don't come out of the washer smelling like perfume."
__label__1,Barely science fiction.: I'm an avid sci~fi reader. I've read a lot of mediocre books through to the end. i could not finish this book. Simple. Painfully slow. Unrewarding. I'm mad at myself for hanging on as long as I did.
__label__1,What a Lemon: I was so excited to get this product. I set it up and plugged it in and nothing. The Tassimo was a lemon. Straight out of the box. One light came on briefly and then went out. I'm exchanging it for another one. Maybe it will work .
__label__2,"Excellent!: I just read ""Coffee Will Make You Black"" recently and it was good. I like the characters and how they were portrayed. Carla, for example, is basically an example of a recent day teen. She does what most teens do today, smoke, have sex, etc. Jean(Stevie), who is the main character, is going through some changes with her mind, sexuality, as well as her body .(What most teens go through.) Stevie goes through a series of scenarios to help her see what her true sexuality is. From a scale of 1-10, I rate this book a 9. The book is good, I kind of didn't like the way it ended, but I would recommend anyone to read it!"
__label__2,"best eyebrow product out there.: i love this product. seriously the smoothest, most efficient eye brow pencil out there. i had gone to Sephora 4X and each time this product was sold out, so I was ecstatic to find it on ecom. Sure it was more money, but it was marvelously worth it. I bought TWO. love it."
__label__2,"Overall, one of the greatest fantasy movies of all time.: There are few fantasy movies that hold both a thrilling plot, exciting characters, and such encompassing battle-scenes as Krull."
__label__2,This was a good start: This was a good start to the series. I have already read the series so I was a little disappointed at how short this was. If you haven't read the series start here. If you have read the series I don't know that you need to waste your time & money on this.
__label__2,"as good as any video every made: my kids absolutely loved this, Nemo is now the nickname to our little boy, he can't watch this video enough. I love the graphics, it is so reall like."
__label__2,Good repellant: Bought this to guard our ten year old patio swing with canopy. Water beaded up and ran off all summer
__label__1,Any rating above one star is influence of Satan.: Why would you shell out $13 for this garbage when you take out piles of it every week for the sanitation department to collect? Save your money or spend it on someone with talent.
__label__2,"great book, I learned from it: I liked this book alot. I learned what it was like for a Celt and a Roman in Scotland during the time of the Romans. This book involves present day and the past. It begins with Neil Perkins a schoolboy of this age who lives near Hadrian's wall and studies Latin. The book also ties in some Christianity in with the picture. Hostage Lands is a good book on my list and I hope others will get to read it too."
__label__1,Wished I didn't spend the money: So in buying this book for a comlpete brake job on my 1979 F350. I looked at every single page... Nothing in this book had the info I was looking for. I would suggest going to a local book store and seeing if the information that you realy need is in these books before buying saves time and money. Thank god I had the general knowledge to complete the job.
__label__1,"Not worth it for me: I guess this is going against popular (pun not intended) opinion, but I didn't really care for this book. I thought Steph was kind of lame and didn't really have any remarkable qualities. She doesn't seem to like the friends she has and she doesn't realize that she's in L-U-V with her nerdy guy friend. Some of the other characters were also frustrating. There was something about the timeline of the plot that made it really unbelievable - Steph starts getting really popular in the course of a week. I liked her relationship with her grandfather and his fiancee, who is actually her guy friend's grandma (weird). I hate stories where the main character swoons over the popular guy/girl, and then realizes at the last minute that it's their friend-of-the-opposite-sex that they really love."
__label__2,origami sheets: This paper is beautiful and works well. It makes wonderful origami projects. The paper is very high quality. Try it.
__label__2,"Funny: When I saw his special on Comedy Central, I knew I had to get it. One of my favorite parts is when Jeff is reading ""the night before Christmas"" and Peanut throws in his own 2 cents. Very Funny!"
__label__1,Ponderous: I have been a fan of Diana's since day one and this release is such a disappointment. She has gone a new direction and it does not work. The songs seem to have no melody and just seem ponderous. I have tried to embrace it....it just does not work.
__label__1,"why do people like this game?: This is the biggest disappointment I've had in purchasing a game in years. This game has such high acclaims, but lives up to none. The graphics are poor, and the game play is dull. The real-time battle scenes reminded me of the Blue and the Gray (a great Civil War game 5 years ago!). The world conquering is slow and makes Civilization seem fast paced. I love the Civilivation games, I love real time strategy games, I love historical things, but I hated this game."
__label__1,"A waste of money: I bought this book as I am interested in pearls, and there is a fantastic photgraph on the cover. Well, you can't judge a book by its cover!!! It is poorly written, and full of factual mistakes. The authors are too gushy and breathless in their admiration for certain fashionable women, whom they regard as the last word in setting the styles for we plebians to slavishly follow. page 114 - The date for the Valentino film, The Young Rajah, is given as 1939. It was released in 1923, and Valentino was long dead by 1939. page 132 - ""Miss Scarlet donned a triple strand of pearls for her marriage to Ashley in Gone With The Wind (1939). Did I miss the point of the whole film??? page 61 - there is a photo taken at the coronation ball of Nicholas II. There are 8 assorted Princesses', Duchesses' etc, sitting and standing, but there are 9 names to fit to the women! Well, enough. I think I've made my point."
__label__2,"Not utilitarian: The teapot is beautiful on the outside, and has a smooth, enamel finish on the inside - not just cast iron. A wire strainer under the lid will hold loose tea or a bag. The handle is hollow metal. The teapot isn't very large, not much larger than my fist. I would use this as a serving set on the dining table, adding steaming water from a more conventional pot. I think it could survive being on an electric burner, maybe even a gas burner, but I would expect some discoloration around the bottom."
__label__2,"Great, underappreciated show: NewsRadio is a great show that seems to have been forgotten about over time. The DVD provides hours of entertainment, and is a great tribute to the comic genius of Phil Hartman."
__label__2,"Smart Symphony: I first received this CD in 1997 free with the hospital baby bag. I have loved it so much that I bought another when I lost, no, when my teenagers borrowed and lost my first copy. The selection includes traditional favorites and very nice less heard pieces. Fuggi, fuggi, fuggi is performed by a great renaissance band that plays festivals around the country if you are a ren fest type person. I guess I'll buy my teens their own copy of Smart Symphonies."
__label__1,"Nicole Kidman? Who?: Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore were equally as good if not better than Nicole Kidman in this movie. I really have to wonder why the academy gave the oscar only to Kidman.And... as I watched the extra interviews with the actresses, I found myself thinking, ""Who is that Nicole Kidman?"" She looks nothing like the Kidman I know today, December 22nd, 2004. What did she do to her face? Botox? Today there is no expression in her face and her eyebrows are flat. THAT Kidman, in those interviews is the princess we all fell in love with in film. The faded blonde hair of late, the flat eyebrows and expressionless brow take the uncommon beauty out of her.I gave this movie two stars for Mel Harris, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Kidman. It was a mesmerizing film, but it was ultimately too in love with itself."
__label__1,"Not absorbent: These pads are not absorbent. I have an older bichon; not a large dog. In the past, I have used the 4-paws Wee-wee pads, and they work very well. I purchased these ""Wee Wee and Housebreaking Training Pads,"" because I thought I would try to get them in bulk, and the description says they are ""highly absorbent."" Well, I certainly did get lots and lots of them, but it was no bargain, because I have to put down so many of them. These pads are barely better than putting papertowel on the floor for the dog to pee on. If I am not able to pick up the pad right after he pees, then it seeps to the edge of the pad, and onto the floor. I really don't understand the reviews that like the product, unless they haven't tried anything else. I recommend against using these pads, if you are trying to protect your floors from the effects of dog urine."
__label__2,Excellent: Excellent little item at a great price. I bought 4 of them. I like the fact that it's easy to install and very low profile. Elegantly simple.
__label__1,"Great camera, but prone to costly repairs: I have had my Canon GL2 for several years. It worked fine for the first 2 years or so, then I got the dreaded ""Remove the Tape"" error. After looking online, I saw that a lot of others had the same problem, and that the only solution was to send it in for replacement of the tape drive mechanism -- to the tune of $250.I bit the bullet, sent it in, and it came back fixed --- for a while. Now it's about a year after the fix, but I only used the camera a few times, and the problem has returned.The camera is easy to use, and shoots good video, but if I had to do it over again, I would go with another manufacturer. For [...]bucks, thething ought to work. My experience with this camera, and previous digital still cameras is that Canon quality/longevity leaves a lot to be desired.My old (10 yrs) Sony digital 8 camera is still going strong. I will look at Sony and Panasonic to replace my Canon, and never go back."
__label__1,"AWFUL: Opened the cover and placed vhsc tape in place, and it would not close. It is still stuck in open position with no tape. NEVER got to use it. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL"
__label__2,"If you listen hard enough you can hear greatness.: I will fully admit this is a hard album and band to get into. Some things are very lo-fi, noise related, experimental, not really song oriented. If you can get over all that, what you have here is a very creative album of what I would call song snippets. Most would say that ""glow"" is the best song on the album, I really like that song, but I would say that ""the pull"" is the best song on here. The simplistic syncopated guitar chords, the harmonies hark back to ""children of the future"" era steve miller, and then when the drums and distorted guitar come in, its amazing."
__label__2,"Their worst Album.............For some people: This album is an incredible maturity when compared to Metallica's previous albums. However,for the die-hard MetallicA fans, this album is the ""weakest"" album they've ever made. The ultra-heavy riffs are strangly absent, yet there is a more blues-metal accent to it. Death-metal fans probably wouldn't like this album,but, if you're new to the heavy metal world, this is a great album to pick up."
__label__1,"I was disappointed to find this was not a ballet video: This production is not for everyone, especially fans of traditional ballet and Tchaikovsky. While the overall production is of a very high caliber, I found occasional vocal interruptions by the cast during the performance (yowls of ""hurrah!"" for instance) to be especially disturbing. Do not purchase this video unless you are familiar with the contents. Definitely not appropriate for children!"
__label__1,"Smells like creosote!: Tried this on my son for about 2 minutes. Hours later at bedtime I can't understand why his hair smells like tar. Then I smell the hat and realize it smells like creosote! I ordered two and they are both disgustlingly stinky. I washed them today and they still stink. My husband came in from outside while the hats were in the dryer and asked, ""what is that chemical smell?"" Unless you like chemicals on your head, I would suggest you not purchase this hat. Cheap."
__label__1,Don't bother with this product: Save yourself a few dollars and chop up the ingredients yourself. Two speeds? Where? It turned my tomatoes (which I had cut into quarters as recommended) into mush without managing to chop a thing.
__label__1,"Could have been MUCH better and shorter: The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie."
__label__1,"Unfortunately, it's flawed...: As expected the AudioStation sounds very good. However, there are some functional problems that ruin the experience. On the unit both volume controls turn down the sound level. Every time the iPod is turned on while in the Audiostation it defaults to shuffle mode, regardless of how you left it. The power supply brick was unexpected (I hate them) and it's too loose fitting; the plug falls out with the slightest nudge. I have no idea how this product made it through the quality control department!!! Shame on Logitech - drop this failure and start over!"
__label__2,One of the Best: I have to say that Glory is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has everything that someone would want in a movie. The acting is outstanding and the battle scenes are excellent. You really become drawn into this film very quickly. I highly recommend this!
__label__2,"Healthy and yummy: My daughter and I love this organic and healthy oatmeal. I do agree with other reviewers that the flax seeds should be ground rather than whole, but we just add some to our bowl... It tastes terrific with a bit of honey or sugar, and some fruit. No aftertaste. Consistent flavor."
__label__1,Don't buy!: My son also had the previous version of the aquarium and when we needed to replace it after 2 years decided to get the newer version. The first one I bought didn't even have the separate battery compartment so I had to return it. I put the second one together last night and was amazed at how much of a pain it was. Do the designers at Fisher Price not realize how precious our time is? The screws in the battery compartment were impossible to see. I just had to stick the screwdriver in and hope to find the screws.But that is not even the worst part. My son was mesmerized by the sea creatures going around the track on the ocean. Little did I know how disappointed he would be the very next day when the fish stopped moving altogether!Forget about buying this item if you don't want to deal with returns.
__label__2,"An Enchanting Story: In Caroline Cooney's enchanting book Both Sides of Time, the story starts out when Annie travels back in time to the 1800's, Cooney uses descriptive words to form mental pictures of what life was like back then. Annie falls in love with Strat, a wealthy boy who lived in Stratton Mansion. Annie wanted to say with Strat, but she wasn't sure how that would affect her time. Though none of us have time traveled, most of us have experienced a time in which were unsure whether to follow our hearts or our minds. We give this book five stars and four thumbs up!"
__label__2,"Very informative and practical!: Tim Elmore is a visiting pastor at our church, northridgechurch.com in MI.We love his stories and insight on raising leaders that serve the Lord.We can learn so much for the stories of others and Tim is talented at taking someone's story and applying the lessons from that story to the rest of us. A very good read."
__label__1,"Wasn't what I was looking for: I read this book with a group of teachers as part of our book club. I had high hopes that it would provide some great discussion. After the first few chapters nobody liked it. Out of the 8 of us that read it, not one of us actually enjoyed the book. There were some good points, but too philisophical for our taste."
__label__1,"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: I've seen some stinkers over the years but this takes the prize. A dreary, meandering tale about...? A guy growing younger and then what? The premise could have been interesting but sadly this was not only a waste of time (almost 3 hrs), it was a waste of $$ since I paid to see it at the theater. Granted, some movies are simply meant mindlessly enjoy and not think about too much, but to watch this mess you need to check your IQ at the door and/or get a lobotomy beforehand."
__label__2,"worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BEST AMP EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: You should buy this I bought this from the guitar center 5 weeks ago. Before I got it I went to the guitar center to try out other amps. My uncle came and bought it for me.my top 10 amps1.Line 6 Spider 2 (Have this)Tryed it out alot2.Mesa boogie3.PV4.Crate5.Vox6.Marshall 20007.Marshall 8009.Marshall 20010.Marshall MasterI love the features and the insane and crunch tones they got.it would blow you away with effects like Chourus Flange, Phaser,Tremolo, delay, tape echo, sweep echo and distortions to choose from like Clean,Twang,Blues,Crunch,Metal,Insane. theres a red and green light that will flash for distortions. I turned mine all the way it was more powerful then I imagined. Also in output/direct out plug with a pedal plug. I think if you were doing a concert you should play the line 6 spider 2 get it now.Best for every type of music.From Devin"
__label__1,"Quake: Don't be fooled, the alleged reviewer from France is the author himself. If you read the authors writing and can understand what he is saying, this book is for you. If not and you want to learn self-defense, go to a school, you will not learn anything of value from these books.This author has harrased and slandered many martial artist because he believes he has invented ""the worlds perfect martial art"". Save your money!"
__label__1,Look For Another Option: This is a tempermental piece of equipment. If (and that's IF) you get it to hold the cable connector you need to be very careful if you move the unit it is attached to. It will easily drop off and it's a challenge to connect it again. Very disappointing.
__label__1,"Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection: How disappointing. The rating is not based on the films- four of the five films are incredibly fun and full of lunacy- it is Universal's half-hearted effort that is really a let-down. For that studio to re-release them in no better condition than they were in the late-90s releases is insulting. No effort was made to find better film elements, the extras are pathetic (they would've been fine as part of a larger collection of extras) and ""Duck Soup"", one of the top 100 American Films of all time, doesn't even merit a commentary track!Compare this shoddy work with MGM's labor of love from earlier this year on ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"", and Universal's effort looks darned poor.Universal needs to hear from Marx Brothers fans, too. The Brothers deserve better and so do we."
__label__2,"A fine dictionary: The definitions are much better than in my current dictionary,the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary. I also like havingthe biographical and geographic entries combined with themain dictionary, rather than separately in the back."
__label__2,Best product that costs so little: This product cocts so little and saved me the big cost of having a plummer come to my home. It arrived quickly and did exactly what I was told it would!
__label__2,"Miraculous: If you can imagine a great Mozart opera, with the ideal orchestra, the ideal conductor, the ideal singers and the ideal performance, then this is what youare looking for. This recording is a miracle and has no match since it wasreleased. An essential for Mozart and every Opera lovers."
__label__1,"Lost interest: While I'm not a hardcore connoisseur of anime, I have seen enough to recognize that the art was just okay and the animation not much better than what you see on the tube on Saturday mornings. Lots of the action wasn't action but rather still images. If I want to look at pictures I'd get a comic.I quickly didn't care for the characters and I found the music annoying. In short, there wasn't much draw to watch.I'd guess if you were an anime fan that this one would move to the back of your shelf and soon be forgotten."
__label__1,"Very Disappointing: This toy was a new venture for my 3 1/2 yr. old son. He was moving up to bigger & better things (or so we thought). Putting this toy together was fairly simple, however, keeping it together was a different story. Move it once, and it falls apart. Continually, while he played; he would call me in his room to fix it. Needless to say, it's now in the attic. There is no support to this flimsy product, which makes it completely useless. We will be more careful in our next selection."
__label__2,"subscription for hubby: My husband is a licensed ham radio operator so I bought this subscription for him as a gift. When it came time to renew, I asked him if he wanted me to renew it as part of his birthday gift and he said absolutely!!! He really enjoys it, there is all kinds of information for all levels of hams. So thank you."
__label__2,Great product: Great movie that should be wached by many. I would definitely recommend this movie to other people out there. Enjoy it
__label__2,"Classy Classic: This well-directed film, Robert Altman's last, I believe, is rich and delightful in many ways. I almost feel that I am watching a documentary of the period between wars in the English country house. From the costumes to the cars and servants, the details are right on.Maggie Smith and Derek Jacobi give remarkably fine perfomances. Actually, everyone does, even the funny almost over-the-top, Stephen Fry.I enjoyed seeing this DVD at a friend's house and I knew I wante to view it again and again. So I was happy to find it reasonably priced at ecom."
__label__1,"Reality: An excellent summary of who and what creation is about. It does not necessarily attack the religions in the world but it does confront the fundamentalists of any belief system who would have us believe in a simplistic view of God.. Particularly those who would want us to believe in a rigid set of ""Rules"" to getus ""through"".This DVD helps to create the belief and to some extent establish that ""God"" is an incredible Mystery and that ""Creation"" does have a profound ""Purpose"" of which we are all an important part"
__label__2,"No Frills Slow Cooker: If you want a basic slow cooker, this is it. It has four settings: warm, low, high , and off. It has no timer or auto-shut off and is not programmable in any way. It has no light indicator, which is why I gave it only 4 stars; I like to have that little confirmation that an appliance is on. The outside of the cooker is very lightweight, but the crock itself is nice and heavy. So far it seems to heat evenly; I cooked some oats overnight on low and kept them warm half the day on the warm setting; I had no problem with sticking or burning. THe exterior of the cooker does get a little hot (although the handles do not), but not so much that it would make a huge difference in heating up the kitchen. Since, as noted, this slow cooker is not programmable, I suggest using it with one of those programmable light timers."
__label__2,Charcoal Companion Golf BBQ Tool Set: Looked to be of good quality. It also looked a little on the large size. My son-n-law liked it as a Christmas gift.
__label__1,Does not play: Should be rated 0 stars - This DVD will not load on either of my Blu-ray players or on a computer disc drive.
__label__2,"The Hunger Games: Though I would not purchase this movie after renting, I would consider renting it again. Great action and story from the beginning and I found it to be entertaining. If there is only one part I didn't care for, it would have been the ending. However, I can also see why the writers would end it this way."
__label__2,"BOC happy to know they exsist: the new ep is most worth the time and effort, if you enjoy ambient, the song entitled ""amo bishop"" is one of the most beautiful i have heard in a long time...if you choose to purchase the vinyl, it is baby blue!! it is not only lovely to look at but listen to as well."
__label__1,"unplayable: The reason I gave one star is because there is nothing lower. All the America's Castles DVDs that have the purple playing surface I have trouble with. None of them play on my best, (high priced) machine but will play on my lesser quality backup. However, ""Return to Newport"" absolutely refused to play on either machine no matter what I tried to get around it. This was very disappointing to me as I had waited for ages to get this particular show. I have no trouble with the America's Castles, two disc, Grand Tour set or with Hearst Castle as both of those have the usual silver playing surface. Beware of purple DVDs!"
__label__1,"Bad language software: This cdrom was the worst investment i have ever made. it was not organized for a beginner. there were no chapters, or any way to find out where to start. it made you repeat a bunch of phrases and sentences, so you had no idea what you were saying, unless you chose to see the translation, but it did not teach you the basics. it is rubbish!!!!!! do not buy it!"
__label__2,"Advantage for large dogs: This product was a decent price, although there was a difference in the product, I believe it is a European version, the SAME product, although different packaging."
__label__1,Rubbish... took it back after 2 hours of use.: This is one of the worst saw tools I've ever used to trim trees with. Enough said. Total rubbish product. Took mine back after one attempt at trimming. Definitely not worth the money.
__label__1,"Inaccurate Description: I always read the customer review for information about ecom items. One review states the following ""liner notes are minimal, as is the case with most NAXOS titles, but lyrics in latin and english are provided, which is nice.""This is not true. There are no lyrics. I've checked every cd for some type of txt or pdf file, therefore I think that reviews of other titles should not be copied verbatim to describe similar items from the same vendor. This was not an ecom item, it was sold by The Classical Music Superstore."
__label__2,"Young Eammon Owens should have garnered the Oscar for his: brilliant performance of the intelligent but brutal teenage boy that never really had a chance. His portrayal of Francie was nothing short of genius, reminds me of a young Mickey Rooney's portrayal of ""Puck"" in ""A Midsummer's night dream"" So exuberant, full of boundless energy and right on point. I can't say enough about young Eammon except I hope he keeps on acting and finding great works like this for his ever growing list of fans."
__label__1,"They break: They are good space saving dumbells. I have had mine for 5 months and already both of them have broke. If you drop them when there is a lot of weight on them, like say 50lbs. at the wrong angle, they will brake. The little discs that are connected to the handle part that hold the plates on will snap off like a graham cracker. I completely forgot to send in the warranty registration when I got them, so I am screwed. If you must have these, and dont work out until failure, and set them down gently everytime you use them, theyre for you."
__label__2,"Great for Beginners: Great book for people just getting started with PHP, even if you're not an HTML expert. She doesn't assume that you already know everything and walks you through the examples step-by-step.On the other hand, if you're already familiar with PHP and have been reading through the online manual, or have programming experience with other languages, you might want to start out with something a little more advanced.Definitely a clear, instructive book that's easy to follow. I'm sure I'll be buying other books by Julie Meloni in the future."
__label__2,"John Carter of Mars!: I have to add my 2 cents to these reviews and say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Enough so that I will definitely be purchasing the 3D version of the Blue Ray. It had an intriguing plot, great chemistry between the actors and fantastic special effects. I was not familiar with the 100 year old story/book but would like to read it now that I have seen the movie. It's regrettable this movie did not fare well in the theaters because it's doubtful we'll see any of the subsequent stories brought to life on film. That's a real shame!"
__label__1,pop punk ...: This album is complete and utter trash. I bought this album expectring guttermouth and got blink 182. Blah blah blah I wouldnt even waste my time listening to it if I hadn't already bought it.
__label__1,"Disappointment: What a waste of time. As an avid fan of Survivor I felt that the money spent was not worth it.This was boring, boring, boring and there was no excitement whats so ever and good have gone to a fine resturant for the money spent on this garbage. :("
__label__1,"More like ""Weak Hour"": Thankfully I received this DVD as a gift and didn't waste my own money on it. It's boring and doesn't even have music in the background...my friends and I actually ended up playing an audio power hour in the background while watching the DVD, then we had to mute the DVD because the burping noise got so annoying, then we just turned the stupid DVD off and ended up giving it away. You can find much better Power Hours online for free."
__label__2,Wonderful Spider: I have always adored these spider skimmers and I just had to have one in my kitchen. The tools is very sturdy and it does whatever you need it to do when straining from pots or pans and the handle remains cool at all times. Great gourmet kitchen tool

__label__1,"Not genuine Op/Tech item sent: HDE has Op/Tech info and pictures in details, but a totally different item was shipped. This has happened 2x already, and I am not buying from HDE. Not even close to the real Op/Tech neck strap."
__label__1,"a lukewarm Kool and the Gang with no J.T. Beware!: I am a long-time Kool and The Gang fan, and I was excited that the magic of their live show might finally be captured on a CD. But what I heard instead was a very disappointing, J.T.-less, performance. Great song selection, but the Gang sounds rushed and kind of going-through-the-motions. This was an Australian performance evidently recorded before J.T. reconnected with the band, so the versions are capable vocally but his absence is definitely felt. Its obvious that the comapny clearly wanted to convey the idea that J.T. is the singer on the CD, because his picture is on the cover, and there is no mention in the notes of the line-up to suggest otherwise (actually, there ARE no notes, just ads for the company's other ""product""). Could they be more exploitative, or what? So beware before you buy. And we Gang fans definitely deserved better!"
__label__2,"Good Reference Material: Unless you live by a clear running stream, in the mountains, it would be hard to follow all the recommendations in this book. If you want top rate knowledge of what you should be doing, it's perfect. I can't do it all, but I do what I can. And if I ever have questions on vitamins, minerals, health conditions, nutrients, I can find CLEAR, CONSISE, answers here. He is just a little over the top for the average consumer but in a good way."
__label__1,Totally predicable: This was a B&N Free Friday download and I'm glad it was. Completely predicable with a forced ending. Don't waste your money on this one.
__label__1,"Great album, bad place to buy mp3 version.: This album is one of my favorites, but ecom has decided to lower the bit rate to something unusable. It has a lot of compression artifacts and sounds really bad. After talking to an ecom rep, he said he would talk to their technicians about boosting the quality, but it still hasn't changed. Download this from somewhere else!"
__label__2,"Fantastic introduction to chapter books: We read Charlotte's Web very early - my son was four. Since that's a good deal younger than the suggested age, I thought some of you might want to know that if you want to get started reading chapter books with your young children, give this one a try. Mine was enthralled the whole time."
__label__2,Great watch at a great price: I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loved it. I was looking for a men's watch that had a larger face and this watch is perfect. Professional and sporty.
__label__1,"Where's MST3K When You Need Them?: If you are like me, and saw this flick when you were younger and have fond memories of it, then save your memories and your money. What was I thinking? Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. The jokes are horrible and the timing drags...like watching grass grow. This movie makes ""Spaceballs"" look like an Oscar winner! To add insult to agony, the quality of this DVD is worse than a Betamax bootleg. Fuzzy distorted picture, muddy sound. Probably the worst film quality I've seen since I saw ""Hercules in New York"" on the Late Late movie. Cult? Yes!, Classic? Only if you are really stoned."
__label__1,"massive: I saw that other people really liked these sleeping bags for car camping, which my boyfriend and I intend to do. However, each one of these sleeping bags is massive! We both fit in just one of them and they weighed (and took up) a ton of room! I would not recommend these even for car campers."
__label__1,"Terrible! Ruined!!: What a colossal disappointment. The mixing is hideous, key instruments and passages are totally buried, it's waaay too compressed, on and on. I could have done better with a 4-track. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!"
__label__1,"Too long, too late!!!: Mr. Petrocelli's book seems to fulfill his need to make himself out to be a great lawyer. He fails to realize that just about any lawyer could have won the civil case after all the negative fall-out over the verdict in the criminal trial. He mentions many things that the prosecution did wrong in their case without realizing that in the criminal trial the prosecution's burden was much more difficult. The prosecution could not put O.J. on the stand nor could they use a bunch of heresay evidence. This book is nothing but a rehash of all the reasons we should believe O.J. Simpson committed the murders. Trust me, you've heard it all on the news. I have read many books on this subject and this one was the worst."
__label__2,ohh so sick: This is one of the most twisted CD's I own. The rapping is so good and Eclypse flows like no other. I advise getting this for anyone who likes sick lyrics and this type of rap.
__label__1,"terrible: I had to return it to Norelco for my money back. The LED light did not go on during the initial charge-up, like it was supposed to. In general the device seems light and flimsy with plastic where I would have expected metal.To make matters worse, I have never received an email from Norelco confirming, they received my return-like others do."
__label__1,"Compare: If you liked BEN HUR, you'll love this puppy too...Overly long, emotive and pretty dull with an exagerated action sequence, and some oh so very sincere characters. BUT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GOOD, lol (as if that's what makes a movie good)."
__label__1,"Description incomplete - this is the ""generous length"" version.: If you don't want the ""generous length"" t-shirts, which I've been trying to avoid (which is why I'm buying such a thing online, in the first place), then avoid these shirts. The description most certainly does NOT include the fact that these are generous length."
__label__1,"Too brief for real use: The book is made up of a collection of editorials from FAIR, the public-interest watchdog group. The articles are short and not particularly incisive, and focus on the usual transgressions of America's corporate-owned media. As a reference source Cohen and Solomon's book is not particularly valuable: the articles are simply too brief to provide much useful depth or information. Moreover the groupings lack real coherent unity that follow through on the theme. Still and all, a revisit of Upton Sinclair's struggle against the entrenched wealth of his day (1920's & 30's) provides useful perspective on today's media struggles. And the beat goes on."
__label__1,"I don't like fantasy in my Sherlock: Just recently the nerds on one of my favorite television shows ""The Big Bang Theory"" mentioned enjoying this movie. I remembered enjoying it when it first came out. And especially liking the teaser at the end of the credits which most of the audience missed as they had left the theatre. But re-watching this was a big disappointment. First of all the special effects take up way to much time in the movie that could have been given to establishing a better story line. The idea of Sherlock and Watson being together in school long before the ""Study in Scarlet"" is distasteful. The actor playing Holmes was badly cast. And the sensational ending is just too out of step with the real mood of the Holmes stories.The only thing really good about this is that it may have inspired the idea for Harry Potter."
__label__2,"Why Does EVERYBODY Hate This Guy So Much?: That's a strictly rhetorical question, of course. There are virtually hundreds of great reasons to hate/fear our dangerously incompetent buffoon of a president, not all of which are described in detail in this terrific new collection of thought provoking essays edited by Clint Willis. Writers as disparate as Paul Krugman, Molly Ivins, Greg Palast, Joe Conanson, and Michael Moore offer intelligent, impassioned and often darkly humorous pieces about nearly all the egregious misdeeds of Dumbya and his appalling administration. It's been incredibly painful for this country to have been forced to watch all of the shocking scandals as they unravel on the nightly news. THE I HATE GEORGE W. BUSH READER helps put into perspective the onslaught of outrages that have caused the vast majority of the American populace to shudder in horror. For the few remaining Bush-apologists out there, reading this little gem of a book should act as a profound awakening."
__label__2,"Cat-away: when i first bought this product i wasn't sure how it would work, my cat had a horrible habit of peeing on my daughters blankets in her room if they were left on the floor.It took just once for our kitty to learn that she DID NOT like this product. After having experienced a big swoosh of air right in her face, she avoided it like the plague. If it was out, she wouldn't go near it. After awhile we didn't even have to have it on, just keeping it in the doorway was enough to deter her! It really did keep her out of that room, and because of that the peeing stopped. Wonderful product!"
__label__2,"Same Great Game with just more realms and items: Just picked up the game. If you liked the previous versions on other systems, you'll really enjoy this. More realms, monsters, characters (hidden as well) and twists than other versions. It's more challenging and fun to play. The PS2 version is much more graphically stimulating and makes the shooting and movement more realistic. Great sound effects, music and all-around play throughout."
__label__1,"You get what you pay for: We decided to buy this camera case because it was cheap, and we wanted something to hold our new digital SLR until we could check around for something else. This thing is cheapy made. The zipper doesn't always zip properly on the first try. I wouldn't recommended it."
__label__1,"My rating is for my review: Well, like everyone else, I didn't read the book as it isn't available yet. I am absolutely fascinated by the 'Who's got the biggest' contest being waged by passionate conservatives and passionate liberals.So my review, for Liberals: This is absolute rubbish, I tore mine up and it is hanging in the smallest room in the house ready for use.For Republicans: This is the truth, as good as a copy of the Bible that arrived by fax machine from God. How could anyone possibly question it?Or maybe we should all zip up, read the book when its published, check some facts and then spew bile at each other?Alternatively we could all boycott all of these books from left and right. Because if the reviews of these and others (Al Franken etc) are anything to go by then they, and the tone of this years debate, are dividing the nation.And that is truly a win for the terrorists."

It truly is for beginners and even I found it easy(ish) to do.Desi is a great instructor and she has a clear, calm way of cuing and the camera work also allows you to see the moves better and practice them yourself and follow along well. There are two workouts, Solar and Lunar, which seem to be a trend now (doing an AM and PM workout). The Solar one is energy boosting and the Lunar routine is more stretchy and slower paced to be relaxing. It is meant to also lengthen your muscles which I feel it is probably doing.I've done this three times now and I'm constantly getting a little better. I find it great to do on hectic days because it really is relaxing, and each workout is under a half hour so it's not too hard to fit into your day. I like this a lot and would highly recommend it to almost everyone. It is very do-able."

Then I remembered that they broke the seasons up into volumes and are charging over $20.00 for half a season. Then I noticed that they have the entire season 1 & 2 for over $100.00. Well guess what? That price is still entirely to high. What a rip off. It is very possible that I won't be getting that for anyone for xmas due to the absurd prices for a 70's show that to me was not very funny. The only thing this show had worth paying for is the many guess appearances. Thanks, but no thanks."

It shows you how to make clothing to home furnishings -- from hems and pockets to curtains and duvet covers. I am a novice sewer and I found the photos in this book very helpful. The photos are colorful and bright -- not just drawings like you see in many books. This book also gives examples of sewing basics. It shows you basic and advanced stitches, how to use paper patterns, edges and many much more. This is a thick book that is great if you need a visual guide to get you sewing."

You can turn it on and set the timer to turn it off automatically. I am on my second set. The first set lasted 6 years before they had cracks form. I definitely recommend this to someone over an in ground system.

The micro-print guide for vegetables on the back of the unit is not enough information to make me keep it. How much water should be added to rice in the rice bowl? Same as stove-top cooking, or less, because of the steam? What about brown rice, or pasta, or, as the instruction booklet suggests, poultry or meat? The instructions direct the user to ""fill the water reservoir...to the appropriate line"" with no advice about which fill line is appropriate.I'm not willing to waste food or ruin meals with trial-and-error. I'm returning the product today."
__label__1,"It's all down hill from the Poisonwood Bible.: The first book I read of Barbara Kingsolver's was The Poisonwood Bible. It was so good that I decided to read more of her stuff. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from there folks. Poisonwood is fabulous and I've not found her other books to be any where near as good. In fact I read The Bean Trees a few months ago and I really can't remember much about it. Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me."
__label__1,"Rob Thomas fails at an attempt on teen drama in Slave Day: I found the book ""Slave Day"" by Rob Thomas to be both predictable and dull. It simply used teen stereotypes to tell the story of these high schoolers. The author didn't tell us anything about Tiffany's picture of her grandfather and why she was ashamed of it. You didn't see anything happen between Mr. Twilly and the theater teacher, which the author set you up for the whole time. If the author wanted to make it interesting by keeping us guessing he could of supplied some supprises in the plot which was utterly pretdictable. I was dissapointed with this lame teen drama."

Oftentimes my own experiences were very similar to what Marty had undergone. It gave me some deeper wisdom and understanding about myself as a human being. After a little of inner reflection after reading the book, I am also seeing myself to have much improved as a trader. I now know why he titled his book, ""Pit Bull"". I already had the system and the tools to make it work. What was lacking was an understanding of my weaknesses and tendencies that can be dangerous to a trader.His technique is truly for short term trading of the S&P ( I trade the Naz). Do not use it for other markets that are not similar."
__label__1,"Awful Taste!: Like everyone else I purchased one of these to keep myself from the toxins in our plastic water bottles. I couldn't stomach the awful taste of the water from these. The water tasted of metal. I washed it with baking soda, then vinegar and still the taste remained. So, I'm back to plastic and drinking more water than ever. Huge waste of money for me!"
__label__1,"An exercise in pure trash: This movie has all the makings of a usual sexploitation flick, however this goes overboard with excessive sexual violence and degradation. It starts out with 3 completely naive schoolgirls and a boyfriend, of course one of them is a virgin, on their way to a party, take a wrong turn and run into three cliched mexicans. They are tortured, raped, degraded in the most brutal of fashion. The bottle scene is one of the most sickest, revolting scenes in this movies. The 2nd half is all about bloody revenge, the killings are original but way over the top especially the abortion scene.Avoid this movie at all costs."
__label__2,Review of Omega book: The book is good for the most part. It was very informative and to the point. A lot of scientific explanations which help the reader understand the nutritional value of omegas. I say 90 % of those explanations were comprehensible from my point of view. I think the book is too short. More research needs to be done. More clinical studies. I just wish I could get more information on the alternative medications for bipolar disorder.

__label__1,"Stephanie Plum, Make up your mind already!: I've loved every book in the Stephanie Plum series, but this one lost my interest. I'm sick of reading over and over again how much Stephanie loves Morelli and how much Stephanie loves Ranger. Who cares. She needs to just make up her mind. Or give up men and become a lesbian. Anything is better than more whining about how she loves both guys and can't decide.I'm totally over it.Of course, Grandma and Lula are still totally funny."

__label__2,Tough Turf To Master: After I popped this game into my NGPC I found I couldn't stop playing. The three available courses are fun and some holes are really challenging. The game is very easy if you use the hidden set of clubs (you get them after winning the triple crown) so I would recommend sticking with the standard clubs for fun and challenge. With the hidden clubs you don't have to read the greens at all and that's not as fun but they do allow you to score eagles which are a practical impossibility with the standard clubs. If you want to have hours of fun buy this game!
__label__1,"Starts great but slowly bogs down with forensic details: I was excited to dive into this book and was not disapointed with its gory and dramatic premise. It soon became too much work, however, and the story bogged down into forensic and scientific details that was outright boring. Furthermore, the way in which the villian is captured is just too coincidental."
__label__1,"Not too good: I know that this opinion is different than the one of many other people. Most people actually seem to like this book...I didnt though. It was pretty boring and -in a certain way- annoying to me. I disliked the main character, Sarah Booth Delaney. Shes simply too much of a wise guy for my taste. Another thing that other people might find charming is the ghost Jitty, who talks to Sarah Booth...for me, this was just stupid.""Splintered Bones"" is not a bad book...its well-written and the story is okay too, but all in all, its not a masterpiece."

When I do I turn to this book and its companion Photo Idea Index ""Things."" I find the photos, inspirations, tips, etc. get my own creative juices flowing and I come up with an idea of my own for the assignment. Perfect!As the title suggests it isn't so much a technical manual or ""how to"" guide as it is a book of creative ideas and inspirations that will get you in your own creative frame of mind. I am a very left brain oriented person and sometimes the right brain needs a little jump start."
__label__1,"Stylus broke, bad hum: I got this because of its good reviews. I read about the terrible hum, and kind of disregarded it because I wanted a good cartridge for cheap. For about a month, it worked perfectly, then it started humming. Today (about 4 months after buying it) the stylus snapped in half while playing a record."
__label__1,"Overated, selfindulgent, depressing - don't bother: I was really disappointed with this load of tosh masquerading as deep thought. Coupland's view of the future as seen through the eyes of a bunch of now familiar slackers is grim. It doesn't help that there isn't a single sympathetic character to empathise with. The novel veers all over the place, unsure of where he's going Coupland sends us into the realms of the bizarre. Some may consider this novel clever and insightful, I consider it the most pretentious book I've read in a very long time. Is there no hope for humanity? Not while this guy's still writing."
__label__2,"Outstanding Work: Lee Strobel's ""The Case for Faith"" is without question a must for any Christian new to apologetics or for anyone new to the faith. It asks, without reservation, the seemingly ""tough"" questions skeptics love to ask and then with the precision of a power drill answers them with clarity. Guaranteed to be despised by atheists & agnostics and loved by believers, this book is an absolute must on every Christian bookshelf."
__label__2,"A Very Solid Introductory Textbook: We have used this textbook in our 9th Grade Global Studies course with good results. Within each unit it provides an overview of geography, ancient heritage, independence movements, and modern developments for the regions of Africa, all parts of Asia, Latin America, Europe & the Former Soviet Union, and The Middle East. Each chapter is divided into sections - each with preview & review questions, vocabulary, etc. We do supplement this text with enrichment readings, but we have found it to provide a solid foundation for the year-long course."

There is one puzzle that can be extremely annoying in this game, there is no way to save your progress while doing one of the games. I still can not figure out one of the puzzles. But only one of them. If you're going to buy this, be sure to buy it used. It was not that enjoyable. The only things nice are the print station where you can print things, and the mini games, the main games are awfull, with one being so-so, but pitifull. All in all, as a fan of dexter, the print station is worth buying the game, otherwise, stay clear of this game."

The sound is actually worse than the integral speakers on my laptop - 75% top, 25% middle and no discernible bass end. The USB dongle is badly engineered - it was loose in the USB slot, and the mini jack was loose in the dongle. On a friends say-so, I've now tried the Logitech X-140, and I can recommend these speakers without hesitation."
__label__2,"Good CD start to finish: I, personally, am tired of hearing the terms over-produced, sellout and what-not. I am also tired of people saying ""Oh he sounds so much better live"" and your are half right...folks this isn't a live CD nor is it a live performance, it is a studio recording. If the live Howie sounded just like the studio Howie what would be the point of paying to see him live. That being said, bring on the ""over-produced, sellout"" Stop All The World Now, I really enjoyed this CD because it is good...plain and simple. I have also read some of the reviews comparing Perfect Time Of Day to U2 as if that is a negative...is it so bad that someone sees some (I repeat SOME) similarities to one of the most influential, and poignant bands of the past 20 to 30 years. I would consider it an honor personally...regardless this is a good CD and like Howie says on the DVD a good snapshot of where he is musically today...to Howie - keep those snapshots coming."
__label__2,Good Quality: I've had this flatware for years and it still looks like new. I handwash the pieces because I don't want to take a chance with the dishwasher. I just ordered two additional sets and am very pleased. It has a nice weight and looks lovely at the table.
__label__2,"Engaging book -- but not for everyone: This book won't appeal to people who like stories that have beginnings, middles and ends, more or less in that order. At first the author's narrative techniques are hard to get used to, but it's worth it in the end because he always seems to tie up the details of seemingly unrelated threads in the story. Some of the stories are more like prose poems, using sections with the titles of Web browser screen commands, different kinds of legal actions, recipes for cooking Spanish potatoes or titles of terrible 1970s songs like ""Billy don't Be A Hero"" & ""The Night Chicago Died."" The book is oddly effective when it goes into memories of the characters and their experiences. The best story is ""Mysteries of Ranch Management,"" which isn't as good as Annie Proulx's tales of gay Wyoming cowboys but which has more humor and a lot of facts about something called leafy splurge."
__label__1,"A real disappointment: I saw this movie at a bargain theater for $2.50, and felt I overpaid! It didn't help that for some reason it was kind of fake looking (can't be sure whether it was the source or not), very strange. But worse than that, the whole thing felt fakey. I give a lot of grace to rom coms, and don't think there's a thing wrong with escapism, but this movie failed to reach even my two-star minimum standards. The biggest fault is that I didn't care about the characters, or which guy won the girl. That's a death knell in a rom com. The action was ok, but not enough to save the movie. And the best friend? I can't believe the obnoxious characters who pass for friends in quite a few movies lately, and they don't even make me laugh. As they say, With friends like that....And just to compare to another romance/action movie I did enjoy, take a look at Knight and Day. That was like a fun ride at an amusement park, and done a lot better."
__label__1,"It will be a quick return: I just returned my second Cuisinart DCG-12BC Coffee Grinder, there will not be a third one. Both of the grinders lasted less than 6 uses. Each time the grinder failed I was almost done grinding. I did not take time to disassemble the unit but my assumption is that they have a faulty thermal limiter: the unit starts to heat up and the thermal limiter, a safe fuse, pops. Once the internal fuse shorts out it is back to the store or back to the manufacturer. I highly recommend you do not waste your time with this faulty product."
__label__1,"product never functioned properly: replaced a decent zyxel router with this 'upgraded' model, but it disconnected so often that I replaced it. Zyxel support knew there were issues with this model, but were not especially helpful."
__label__2,"Griffin & Sabine: An Extraordinary Address Book: I purchased these to replace an old worn copy of mine and to pass a copy along to a dear artist friend. A delightful book that evokes the mystery and wonderful artwork of Nick Bantock in a way that reminds me of each of the Griffin & Sabine books. Really, the nicest address book I have had the pleasure of owning. It is difficult to find and I was delighted that, once again, ecom came through for me!"
__label__2,"Love It: This product makes me worry less. I love having it around. I suggest that you view your cuticles before sticking it in your child's ear so you can test how much it magnifies. The light is good and i can really see in her ear, i think knowing what i am looking for will come with time. I REALLY wish it came with a case but the box it came in works."
__label__2,"A+: As textbooks go, I found this one very readable - not as dense as most. It was a required text for my ed psych class. It's clear and easy to follow as an introduction to the different theories of developmental psychology."
__label__1,"nothing to get excited about.: Everybody is praising this band for being one of the best out there. But my question is why? If the members of this band were not formerly from very successful bands, I can guarantee you they would not get all of the love they are receiving. This CD is boring, choppy, and unoriginal. It is better than a small quantity of its competition, but lacks in interest and creavtity."
__label__1,"Not very realistic.: I was looking for good historical fiction to appeal to boys, and this sounded like a possibility. Unfortunately, compared to books like Night Journies, The Bell Keeper, and Jericho's Journey, this was pretty weak. The story line basics are okay, but the author throws in so many unrealistic dilemmas that I was laughing by the end to see what disaster would happen next. Also, the children are modern rather than typical of the 18th century."
__label__1,"Used battery, got a refund, don't waste your time.: Battery arrived with marks on the contacts and won't hold a charge for more than 4 hours stand-by or fifteen minutes of talk time. Got an easy refund, then an email half-apologizing ""the battery sent to you is brand new although due to being a older version of the phone and these batteries are manufactured sometime ago tend to lose some talk time"" and a call to that effect as well. Best not bother with this, get a factory-new battery if you need one."
__label__1,"Overhyped &Overrated!: Anthrax should have changed their name after their powerful debut if this was the new direction they were headed.This band's sound changed so dramatically it was astounding. I blame them for helping to destroy true heavy metal. They started trends that led to heavy metal going underground before a re-emerging.I remember hearing ""Death from Above"" from their debut on a metal radio show and being blown away by the power it delivered.I am judging this album because Anthrax let me and other metalheads down with this new punkcore direction. Had this been their debut I would not be so critical,however even on its own it still bores me.No real memorable riffs here. With this album Anthrax gave Heavy Metal a dirty beating and left it severely injured in an alley."
__label__1,"Friction Mount: This was the wrong item, it didn't have the mounting to attach the Navigational system."
__label__1,"Defective.....: This movie is great and that is why I bought it but, for some reason, this DVD was in black and white. I returned it."
__label__2,"Great for initial learning of instruments...: As a student of Surgical Technology, I need to know all the instruments to hand to the surgeon and assistant. The book is good, but has one shortfall; the pictures are somewhat vague. I mean, that many instruments look alike. The photographs could've been taken to show the curve of many instruments or a macro lens could've been utilized. Still, it's the best book out that I know of to help you learn the instruments."
__label__2,"Easy to Install: The film is easy to install and looks great! It is thick, and gives the impression of a true frosted/texture glass window.Be aware some reviews have noted that though it does block some view from the other side, it does not make for the privacy properties of a true textured window. You'd have to get an actual textured window for that ! :-)But this is a wonderful and changeable cosmetic option to add some privacy that will not block as much light as blinds or shades."
__label__2,"Beautiful china: The china is beautiful and arrived very quickly after it was ordered and very much in time to be given as a wedding gift! My only reservation is that the shipping packaging was taped sloppy. Only one piece of packing tape was used to tape on each side of the box, and that one piece did not catch both flaps all the way to where the box was ready to fall open when it arrived. For such an expensive product, they should have taken more care with packing it to ship."
__label__1,"Hygrometer review: When you look at the photo of the hygrometer on the website, it is very appealing, but the picture is deceiving. This hygrometer had no dimensions on which to base it's size. It is only 1"" in diameter, which is very small. I had hoped it to be at least 6"" so it was very upsetting when I got it. It was a gift for someone and I was quite embarrassed to give it to the person."
__label__1,Not thrilled: This machine was extremely loud with terrible vibrations which sent the cup off the platform. The attachment for coffee grounds/pods fit so tight it could hardly be turned all the way in as instructed. Sent back for refund until I find another similar machine.
__label__2,A Fabulous Album: A fine album of late 1980's funk/dance music done gracfully by the diva Grace Jones.
__label__1,"terrible: Well let me start off by saying, I am a pretty small person with pretty small features. I always have an issue with things like, say, hats... normal sizes are generally a bit too big and children's sizes are way too small. I tried these headphones on and they were WAY TOO BIG. Too wide. They don't hug my head or my ears at all. They just kind of sit there. And if I moved at all they would just flop off of my head. This makes the noise cancelling feature pointless because the ear parts weren't on my ears correctly. I read a review about children wearing them... well, they must not be picky children. I know how a good pair of headphones is supposed to feel, and this certainly is not it."

__label__1,"Does not stay on curved track.: This engine is cute and seems to be well constructed. It does a good job of going up ramps, is easy to turn on and off, and takes a single battery. However, it kept running off any curves in the train track. We decided to return it and look for something that will stay on our son's track."
__label__1,"He has written such better books: To me, Doug Allyn is one of the many underrated authors. I have enjoyed everything he has written, but this is not my favorite. These are not sensitive, new age cops; these are hard-bitten, street-smart, been-there-done-that cops. The dialogue, language and racial slurs are explicit but realistic. Garcia is a Viet Nam vet who accepts that he and his African-American partner were hired to fill ethnic quotas. My biggest problem was his absolute conviction that he knew who the killer, even though evidence didn't support it. The actual killer comes as a surprise, but it was a twist that just didn't feel right. I did enjoy the reason for the book's name, though. I believe this was his debut novel, and it shows. I'd recommend skipping the two Lupe Garcia books and move straight to Mitch Mitchell."

__label__1,"A self-published, 156 page novel: 'nuff said?: The first 5 reviewers here are obviously the best friends of Margaret Doner! This is a skimpy foray into too deep waters for a beginner. Have you ever read a good Tudor biography that was only 156 pages long? Can you imagine that there are any significant facts, details, insights in so few pages? Well, you're right--there aren't! What we do have are stereotypes (dirty old king, lusty Chaucerian wench, stupid courtiers, etc.). What is most egregious is that there is never even an attempt to explain why and how Catherine and her cohorts could have made so many stupid mistakes, how they could behave as if there had never been an Anne Bolyn: that's the mystery that has always fascinated me about Henry's ""rose without thorns,"" but you'll find no answers here. Please save your money, your time, and be a bit more patient. Eventually, someone is going to write a truly good historical novel about Catherine Howard."
__label__1,Not what I expected: This is not the best Nora Roberts book I have read. I guess I not into spells and things like that. Should have paid closer attention to the book jacket.

__label__2,"Holmes HM1700 Humidifier: You get what you pay for. It is great for larger rooms, but it definitely does not last anywhere near 24 hours on a fill. Its more like 8. It can be a little loud, but it does work very well, and you can immediately feel the effects."
__label__1,"A waste of time and money: Just when the rap game was getting too redundant and cliche, 50 Cent comes out.This album has all the production to be a classic, but there is no originality to the lyrics and style. Rap music needs a savior if this is it's future."
__label__1,"Bobby Heenan DVD: Another WWE stinker!!!! No comments from the ""Brain"" himself, who was one of the funniest men in the history of wrestling. Barely any snippets of his comedy, just poorly done. I won't be wasting any more of my money on WWE dvds."
__label__1,"Aggravating: I received this mouse packaged with a keyboard as a Christmas present. The keyboard works 100% (although now I've probably put the whammy on myself), the mouse is one of the most irritating pieces of technology I've ever owned. For no good reason it constantly quits working. I've been through all the ""help"" (yeah, right) and nothing I've tried fixes it. It's not even 10 inches from the receiver with nothing blocking the signal, yet the cursor will totally freeze on-screen and nothing I try will make it start working. I end up having to re-boot to get it working again. I may keep the keyboard, but the mouse is going."
__label__2,"The Fast and The Furious Was Awesome!: Hey Everyone! I loved this movie. Not only was the plot great and stuff, Vin Diesel was sooo sexy! His voice is really nice. Paul Walker isn't bad to look at either. It's a great movie and not only is it action packed but at the end you can see how good of friends Dominick (Vin Diesel), and Brian (Paul Walker) really were."
__label__2,"Brilliant guitar pop from former low-fi heroes.: When I heard GbV was going to be produced by former Car RikOcasek, I grew a little nervous. I expected waves of sythesizersqueels and other New Wave junk where there once would have been majestic, anthemic low-fi guitar. Thankfully, this is not the case- Mr. Pollard and the crew have created another brilliant pop masterpiece with howling Byrdsy/REM-ish guitar and beautiful Beatlesque vocals. In fact, this would have been the guitar album of the year if Built to Spill hadn't released ""Keep It Like a Secret"". GbV, however, are produced on this effort, and this means certain concessions- less oblique lyrics, less background fuzz, and no more wacky song titles like ""Tractor Rape Chain"" or ""Kicker of Elves"". If I had more faith in humanity, I'd say this album could be a mainstay on FM radio, but let's face it, the American airwaves still aren't ready for something this good. Do the collapse, baby! You'll be glad you did."
__label__1,Did We All Read The Same Book?: Definately not one of Buffa's best. It appeared not even the author knew which direction he was headed midway thru the novel. Poor characterization and a cheap ending.
__label__2,"Beautiful. "".....she needs to hear shes beautiful....."": First off, i wana say that ""I Wanna Save You"" saved my life. Anyway, leaving through a window is my all time favorite cd. The lyrics are all beautiful and the music are awesome. Although songs like ""If U C Jordan"" and ""Punk Rock Princess"" are more for fun and easy listening where as ""Cavanaugh Park"" and ""I Want To Save You"" have emotional lyrics. I strongly suggest you go out and buy this cd right away. It is well worth your hard earned money."
__label__2,The Best I've Found: I am relatively new to PowerBuilder having been in an actual production environment (outside of college) for about 7 months now and have read everything I can find on PowerBuilder. This is by far the best book I have been able to find. The author explains its capabilities clearly and the examples actually match the lesson. Far too often the examples briefly touch the subject and you finish a book no better off than when you began. Not so with this one. I highly recommend it for beginning PowerBuilder developers.
__label__2,Love this writer!: In my opinion no other writer can come close to this one however there are a lot of writers whose books (stories) I enjoy just as much. This writer and her books are excellent!
__label__1,"Mormons Already Believe in Jesus Christ and the Holy Bible: I appreciate the good will involved in this book very much. But anyone who knows anything about the beliefs and doctrines of real Mormons - members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - knows that they believe in Jesus Christ as the Savior of us all, and the Son of God, and trust in the Holy Bible as scripture. Our whole faith centers around Christ and His life and teachings, and His resurrection, and atonement for our sins and mistakes, and the knowledge that He will return someday. No one needs to introduce us to Christianity. We share that common faith with all other Christians. The Book of Mormon is a second witness, to go with the Holy Bible, that Jesus Christ lives and will return."
__label__1,"Great story, terrible printing (beware S&P): The story is terrific, classic Conrad. The printing is rubbish though (I am referring to the version published by S&P; with the sandy shore on the cover). The font size is miniscule - almost impossible to read - while the book's title is printed in an enormous font at the top of every page. It looks like a PDF gone wrong.Get the book, but from a decent publisher. There is no way I'm buying another S&P; product."
__label__2,mellow: harmonic voices....instrumentals right on spot....if you enjoy coffee houses or jazz clubs music you will love this
__label__1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD: Looks like it's straight from a used VHS tape. You need to zoom in 2x to get it to fill the screen. Too bad, I was really looking forward to seeing this again. Not worth the $9. price tag. Wait for a better DVD."
__label__1,Wow. Disappointing.: Wow - Mariah Carey's Glitter soundtrack is better than this album ;-) Sorry Whitney - but this one's a dud.
__label__2,Awesome CD !!: You will reach for this CD again and again. I have had it since Bad Attitude was released and still love it. Can't go wrong with this one. One of the greatest bands of the 80's.
__label__2,"Perfect for a closet office: I bought this for a closet office. Love it. Easy to assemble and looks great. I am unable to pull out the keyboard tray because of the shape of my closet (the doorway is narrower than the width of the closet), but it is still useful for storage of papers and other small objects. Arrived quickly and well-packaged. Highly recommended."
__label__1,"Horrible DVD Player...5.1 Output Didn't work: I got this hoping to replace my DVD/Karaoke player AND Audio Receiver and ended up with worthless piece of junk. The surround sound didn't work no matter what setting I tried in the setup...the front speakers would not do sound. I had to connect it to my audio receiver.The DVD function of it kept freezing up and the sound kept cutting out. Otherwise, I may have kept it to connect to my audio receiver in place of my other DVD player. But, it still wasn't worth keeping...even with the very low price.Guess I got what I paid for!"
__label__2,"Instant Improvement from Standard AV Cables: As soon as I plugged in the HD link for Wii to my HDTV, the latency went away and the graphics quality increased a noticeable amount!

__label__1,"Not satisfied: I bought this for my boyfriend who has a horrible cuticle biting habit. He said the stuff tasted nasty, and it probably would have done the trick if it didn't make his nails bright and shiny. He said there was no way he could attend client meetings with his nails painted, so he picked it all off and refused to let me apply it again."
__label__1,"Minutemen reunited...: Gun-toting, bible-thumping rednecks from Lower Hollow, North Carolina save Bosnia from the bad guys. I haven't read anything so bad since... (No, I've never read anything this bad). This man writes from a formula that he has down pat. I wonder if his gun manuals are written in the same style. Every situation he gets into is instantly solved either by his martial-arts prowess (taught to him by some unseen USArmy group that carried out political assasinations in Korea) or by one of several guns that he keeps around him. Scary guy.."

__label__1,"Card Shuffler problems: When the card shuffler arrived the wood casing was not glued to the plastic mechanism - there was plenty of glue of some type, but it was not holding. Lifting by the wood casing caused the mechanism to drop.The shuffler frequently sent 4-6 cards into the pit at once. The did not drop properly, and caused a jam on almost every shuffle.Pressing the button intermittently helped a lot, but not enough.I have returned the shuffler to ecom."
__label__2,"Refreshing Read: What a refreshing read. The Success Effect by John Eckberg made me add a lot of other books to my ecom Wish List. John has included interviews with America's best business leaders and innovators. Several of them have their own books and many of these were added to my wish list.The personal jokes and stories are so rarely found in most books of this genre and it made for an entertaining and more impactful read. Thank you John for referring me to this book and for autographing my copy! I am excited to go through your new ""Pot of Gold"" book this next year"
__label__1,"Garbage: I bought this back before they changed the product image. They used to have a picture of the official Zune cable with the Zune logo, so I got it not knowing that it's one of those cheap knock-offs. I was rather peeved by that.I just use the cable to charge my Zune, and it works for that, most of the time. Being cheaply made, it doesn't fit snugly in the device, so occasionally you walk away thinking it's charging, only to return and find your battery dead. This is annoying. The cable doesn't last very long either. I had two of these a while ago, and they both literally fell apart after about a year or two. On one of them, the plastic on the Zune-end literally fell to pieces when I squeezed it one day. On the other one, the squeeze button on the side fell out. If you plan to keep your Zune for a while, I recommend getting the official $7.99 Sync Cable from Zune on here."
__label__1,Doesn't work on really hard pills: One needs a proper grinder like a salt grinder for such pills. Don't waste your time and money. Perhaps one should use a grinder that has sharp edges.
__label__1,"Kinda Boring: This book was rather hard to get through, especially the dream sequences, which I eventually began to skip. Not much happened, other than name dropping, and the end was anticlimactic."
__label__1,"Solid content, formatted POORLY for Kindle: The Schaum series contains solid content for the beginning piano student. I was tickled to see it available for Kindle -- nice for me to have on hand, another option for new students (or their parents). The notation for the songs is so poorly formatted it might as well be unreadable. I'm having trouble, and I have the songs memorized. No way would I put the Kindle edition in front of a student, and frankly, it's not worth the money for me even as a reference. I didn't ""save"" 25%, I wasted 100% of what I spent on the Kindle version. Pbbt. This is a case where the hard copy is worth it."
__label__1,"Ham-handed and a rather ho-hum read ...: I had high hopes for this book. Seeing how it has been spoken of all over the Internet. However, I found the pacing to be slow, and the characterization far to cardboard, which made it hard to truly impossible to care for the protagonist.It was in need of better editing."
__label__1,The Birds by Tarjei Vesaas: I did not read this book until after I had it for a while and when I did read it page 217 was backed by page 220.When I wrote to Tartan Frog and complained they refused to do anything about it because it was so long before I noticed the page missing. I will not use them again. The story was fine I just wish I had a perfect book.
__label__2,Years of Debate.: For years I could not decide what my favorite movie was.... Untill today. My number one. period.
__label__1,"Static in My Ears is more like it: I'm all for giving local bands a chance and that's exactly what State of Being is, a local Cleveland band. And that's about as far as SOB is ever going to get by writing songs like this. If you enjoy thin sounding music created with Casio keyboards and lyrics that are reminiscent of sixth grade theatrics, then you'll more than likely enjoy the tracks on this disc. I had a problem just getting past the weak and monotone vocals.This disc did absolutely nothing for me. Other than make me wish that I were deaf.On a positive note, the lead singer is kinda cute."
__label__2,"A courageous & inspiring story: Anyone going through a life-changing situation such as cancer, no matter what type, can benefit from this book. The importance of humor, accepting help from others, and believing God is with us every step of our journey is echoed throughout this very inspirational book. Carla writes with such honesty, courage, and hope; you can't help but feel uplifted & strengthened after reading it. I highly recommend this book!Barbara Richards"

__label__2,"Amazing Product and Delivery Service!: Purchased this vacuum, from ecom, late on 2/21/07 and it arrived, via UPS, on 2/23/07. Didn't even pay extra for the shipping; use the Free option. Out of the box, one screw later to attach the upper handle, and away she goes. Absolutely amazing...this machine could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch. Read the instructions though. You have an vacuum On/Off switch, and an On/Off switch for the rotating brush. The attachment (furniture brush)worked well for me and cleaned my upholstery of cat hairs in no time.I was looking to buy the Dysun, but I'm well pleased with this product at 1/2 the price.

__label__1,"Hot, hot, hot!: I purchased this for a 2.5 minibow aquarium and found that if you leave the light on ASWELL as the heater it can cause a BIG temperature jump. I mention this because my betta really got stressed from all that heat the first day - I think he got a little sick because of his clamped fins and lethargy the next day. So be careful that the heater doesn't overheat your aquarium/bowl. My idea is to leave it on at night and then turn it off during the day so that the light can maintain the aquarium at a few degrees lower, it's the best option without a 15 watt automatic shut off heater in a 5 gallon aquarium, which is probably what I will do when I can afford it next month! Good luck:0)"
__label__2,"A Slap in the Face from Reality: This book was exactly what I thought it would be, not that I was disappointed. As women, we may not want to believe that a relationship didn't work out simply because 'he's just not into me'. Reading this book and seeing it from a different perspective made me realize how oh so wrong I was when it came to men. Period! I'm screaming at the book because some of these women are so stupid and blind! But then I stop and realize, ""oh wait...that was me once"". I would absolutely recommend this book to any of my girlfriends. It's comical, frank and exactly what I needed to hear! Like I said, a slap of reality in the face!"
__label__1,"Would not recommend it: It is large, but not easy to read unless you are at the perfect angle.if you are slightly to the left or right you can't see the red ""mercury"", also it comes with 1 small screw that won't hold in any windy conditions, plus it mounts flush so you can't angle it so you can read. I drill holes in it and made my own mounts so I could turn it to the right angle and it won't blow away on a windy day"
__label__2,"Cry in the Wild: Based mostly on fact (the ending didn't quite happen the way it shows). Although, the famous kidnapping is almost forgotten, it was really big news in 1966. Peggy Ann continues to live in Pennsylvania maybe 20 miles from where this whole event happened. Many of the others have already passed on.Back in 1991, a version for TV was aired. The video version that came out later had some more footage not seen on the tv special. Most VHS tapes of the movie today have aged which have been restored better in the DVD version.If you like to see a true story with a happy ending, then buy this DVD. It's really a piece of history that will soon be lost as so many things in our fast moving culture."
__label__1,"Very cheesy, predictable, mindless read: I was very interested to read a book from this author as I have never read anything before and saw a few very good reviews. I was so dissappointed when I actually started reading this book. It is SO predictable, and SO mindless. It is so easy to read and requires so little attention that it is a great book when you don't have the time to actually sit down and concentrate on a good book. I only actually finished it because I just had to see how it ended. Of course, it ended exactly as you think it would. No surprises."
__label__1,"An interesting period piece but a failure as a mystery: After thoroughly enjoying Ms Dams books and finding her character Dorothy Martin a vibrant and delightful character I was very disappointed in her new series. Her writing of the period and the life of an immigrant servant I am sure are well researched and accurate. The mystery was contrived and secondary to the story. Hilda Johansson at nineteen, although portrayed as an extremely intelligent young lady, was too brash and manipulating to come across as a character that I would be interested following on further adventures. If some of the characters had been developed further instead of being used just as Hilda's pawns I feel that the book would have had more life and Hilda would have been better portrayed. The most interesting part of the book was Ms Dams portrayel of the servant class at the turn of the century."
__label__1,"I wanted to like this but...: I didn't. The story seemed interesting, but I just didn't like the writing-and a lot of it didn't ring true, many of the things the characters said sounded false, and 'written', not like anything an actual person would say-especially the exchange between the main character and his ex's wife-it all seemed phony-while the story arc was entertaining, none of it seemed real. So overall, not recommended."
__label__1,"earbuds fall out, and it causes cancer: First of all they do work, the rubber part of the earphone do block out some outside sound. However, the rubber part of the headphones are detachable and fall off very easily. Mine fell off in the first week and there are no replacement ear buds with it so I stopped using them.Then I read other reviews on here and find out the wire used on this product contains lead and can cause cancer. Apparantly in very small type this was mentioned on the packaging. I did not even see this. I am mad that this product can even be sold. I hope Coby gets sued."
__label__1,"Spanish: I received the product timely but the instructions were in both Spanish and English. If that was in the product description, I missed it. At any rate, I didn't like the fast pace of the video and I don't like spanish instructions mingled in."
__label__1,"faulty after a few pages: These cartridges are standard enough. Unfortunately, this NEW? cartridge began leaving the characteristic large white stripe of a failing old cartridge only a 10 pages after being installed.Makes me sincerely question the quality of this product."
__label__2,So clean!: My cables for my entertainment center were a mess and required a lot of work when changing things out. After getting these they are not clean and organized. They are easy to install and to take off. My only issue was they were a little long but that was my fault for ordering the wrong length.
__label__1,"Bought the 13 1/2"" scraper, wish I purchased the 9 1/2"" one: I really wanted to love this spatula and have been wanting to buy it since Cook's Illustrated gave it rave reviews in 2008. It is very stiff and way too big for my hand and I'm known for my long piano hands. The white blade is huge and as such I find it awkward to manoeuvre: scraping down a bowl or folding ingredients isn't easily done with this spatula unlike my other smaller mmore flexible silicone ones. The handle has a sharp raised ridge on either side and is uncomfortable to hold. I wish I had purchased the smaller 9 1/2"" model; not sure it would be that much better, although it would likely be easier to use."
__label__1,"Can do the job---slowly: The product works, but the motor is so weak it requires great care. Much simpler (and faster and with better results) to use a blade-type coffee grinder. Those are terrible for coffee, but grind up other stuff just great."
__label__2,"The Happiness Makeover by M. J. Ryan: Good, but somewhat difficult to read. Ms. Ryan's sentences are often hard to follow due to incomplete puntuation; e.g., commas separating phrases -- surprising for someone who is an editor."
__label__2,"BLOODY BRILLIANT: Do yourself a favor quit looking and just buy these. I got mine couple days ago, and love them. I listen to every type of music imaginable. Exceptional in every tune I play. Bose probably cost 300, and they cannot be any better than these. I am a big guy and they are very comfortable on the melon. They do a good job drowning out any background noise. I have no negatives on this purchase. Good stuff"
__label__2,"bedroom farce: i really enjoyed this video have seen it 3 times now each time finding it more hilarious.tells the story of three friends looking for love 2 gay guys and thier female flatmate.excellent preformances from all the cast especially simon callow and hugo weaving.if your looking for a good laugh,heartwarming story get this video."
__label__1,"Too Small: I ordered this shoe in my size and had to return it because it was too small. I got the next size up and it was, again, too small. Ended up just returning instead of doing another exchange of the product."
__label__1,Very Weak - but try to support Tyler Perry: This was not one of his better Madea's movie. Way too much dialogue and not enough funny moments. There great actors but the story line was weak
__label__2,"By far the best in its genre!: I bought this book years ago when I bought a half share in the harvest of a CSA in NJ. At the end of the season, we were overwhelmed with crates of tomatoes. So, I learned how to can tomatoes and make tomato juice (love a good Bloody Mary!). Even with only a half-share, that season I also learned how to freeze greenbeans, strawberries and what you would expect to find grown in the Mid-Atlantic area. When I retired I moved to rural mid-west community. I bought copies of this book for my neighbors, and relatives. Anyone who planted a garden got a copy of this book. It is wonderful and straightfoward. Recipients include an ICU nurse, an IT professional and a dog-groomer. I have a very large collection of ""country living"" books, this is the one I go to over and over. Even if I don't grow it myself, I can buy wonderful locally grown produce in season. A very good companion cookbook is In Season by Sarah Raven."
__label__1,"Misleading description, has a printed measurement strip on it: Specs say this product is 24"" wide... what they don't tell you is that 1"" of that is printed as a measurement strip (shows inches, cm, etc). So for someone like me who has a tank that's exactly 24"" wide, it's not a good solution. I'm going to get creative for the time being and eventually get a product that isn't misleading in its description."
__label__2,"Tight: The gameplay and random freakiness is awesome. The only problem I have is the graphics. They don't stand a chance when you compare them to Resident Evil, but I still believe the game to be creepier than RE."
__label__2,"Great toy - when it works: When I saw this toy online, I thought it looked great for my son (almost 2 years old). The first one stopped working after about one month. I contacted ecom.com and they very promptly sent us another one - free of charge. The second still works - thanks goodness! We really like the wagon. The music isn't too loud or annoying at all. The only complaint I've heard is about the on/off switch being right by the handle and inadvertently turning the toy off sometimes, but we haven't experienced that with our toy. Overall, I really like it - and when we purchased it before Christmas, it was on sale - so for the money - it was a great buy! (Fast forward one month) Well, I am modifying my review. After we received the second wagon, only after two weeks of playing with it, the music started ""skipping."" It only played the first few notes of the song when you pressed the buttons. We threw it in the garbage, realizing that this brand of product just isn't made well."
__label__1,"Not what I expected: This watch came earlier then expected, however it was suppose to come in a box and did not also the watch is a lot more gold then what the picture represented. It looks cheap. The face is nice and easy to read. No way is this a $100 watch originally. It's a $20 costume jewelry watch. Very disapointed"
__label__1,"Didn't work for me: I had to have a complete hysterectomy with both ovaries removed in February. Hot flashes started coming in April, and they have been numerous and were keeping me awake all night. I took the whole bottle,3 per day, hoping it would help, but unfortunately, it didn't help in the least. It obviously works for some, but not for me. I have just been taking benadryl to sleep at nights, in case that would be an idea for anyone else."
__label__2,Review of: Millennium trance Vol. 2: I went to france this summer and this is 1 of the 13 cd's I got that is an import.Nice beat. very good bass.all the song link. only thing i dont like about this cd is there to much words. even though it goes very good with the beat. i personally perfer full out beat.if you like the album you love Tranzworld 3.
__label__1,"Not for Teaching Kids!!!: This book is inadequate to explore the concepts that it puts forward, and the reader will not be able to use it effectively until they go through and fill in the wide gaps left by the author. The techniques within it are not universal to all numbers, and the author fails to mention this on numerous occasions. All in all, this book was designed to make money, while offering the illusion of ""cheating"" your way through math. Some methods within it are useful, while others only overcomplicate, and ultimately undermine, standard education techniques for mathematics, the standard way oftentimes being the more accurate, and quicker, way to do the examples within. Math is hard, sure, and that does make a lot of people hate it, but this book will make you hate it more, at least until you figure out what a scam it is."
__label__2,Hot and Spicy: Kind of perfume you want to wear when you want to sizzle. Bold. Take Charge. I have not had anyone say they didn't like it when they smelled it from the bottle.
__label__2,"Great for speech therapy in ECSE: I'm a Speech-Language Pathologist in Early Childhood Special Ed. I don't use the cards that come with the Cariboo game; however, I make my own to address articulation, vocabulary, answering questions, etc with my students. This is a great game for preschoolers."
__label__1,"Out of date: This book is now (in 2011) hopelessly out of date. While you can spend the time figuring out where the paradigm has shifted between V.6 to V.8, which is significantly, it's not a productive way to work with a tutorial book.I very much hope they will produce a new version for version 8, and with the many errors and slap-happy writing noted in previous reviews, corrected.Under the circumstances, which are me reviewing a book for which I shelled $50 which then proved to be outdated, error-prone, and generally sloppy, with no warnings beforehand, 1 star is too generous. Buyer beware."
__label__2,Nice Book to Read: This book was about indian girl who met a fan of american girls soccer team and had trouble with her family to play the game that she liked since she was a child. she did everything possible to join soccer girls team to train and be more professional at that game that took her to travel to Europe to play soccer. I had good time reading this book.
__label__2,"More pickles please....: Is the comments we hear when recipes are used from this book. Great photographs, Great recipes, Great addition to your cookbook library."
__label__1,"Doesn't work with MacOS X Leopard (10.5): The description says it works with MacOS X 10.1 or above. This is a lie. I have an Intel MacOS laptop running the latest 10.5.4 and this device is not recognized. I have written to SmartDisk TWICE and have received no answer. Apparently Verbatim bought SmartDisk a little while ago and while they still claim to have Tech. Support, in reality it appears as though Verbatim doesn't care about these devices.Too bad. It was a nice device!"
__label__2,A very helpful intro to the game: The didactic approach used is very useful to understand the link between the basic techniques exposed. It is helps me enjoy playing with a software pgm.
__label__1,This trash has to get 1 star?: All it is would be mindless idiots screaming out mindless noise.When will these guys get killed off?
__label__2,"His best - in my humble opinion: His first is still Saul's best book. Eerie and thrilling. Alas, as this was a big hit, he wrote exatly the same for nearly 20 more books, but here it is still fresh. If you want to try out Saul, or just read one of his books, try this one. There are others which are also quite ok, but, yes, try this one first"
__label__2,"Fantastic Starters DVD: If you wanna get in shape and get your body used to the basic exercise and heart rate it should be used to, this is an awesome workout DVD. It might be a bit tough in the beginning if you're not really used to working out, but that's the whole point. It pushes your body step by step to get to where it should be. There are 3 stages so once you feel your stamina is built on the first stage, move on to the next. Your body needs to be challenged in order to are results! If you feel some muscle pain, you're doing it right. I personally use the McDavid waist trimmer during the workout and I sweat 3 to 4x more in my midsection. Good luck everyone!"
__label__1,"Terrible.: Do not buy this product. It wears down and breaks, either at the handle or by the cord (yes, I used it so much that it wore down the rubber cord so that it broke).Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a better rope."
__label__2,"Great DVD: If you like drums and you like Rush drums, this DVD is great. Neil Peart is a great drummer and having him explain how he prepares for live performances is nice."
__label__2,"Much better than anticipated: When I picked this up for my book club, I was dreading the fact that I'd have to read it. Once I got through the first third of the book, I couldn't put it down. I don't think that this will sit well with people who interpret the Bible literally, but it is an interesting adaption of biblical stories told from the woman's point of view. The cover led me to believe it was a very religious-based novel, but I think it asks the reader to question many of the things found in the Bible and to try and find the story behind the words on the page. Interesting characters, lots for discussion -- a good read."
__label__2,MORE OF A GREAT THING.: PSYCH IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SERIES ON TV. LOVE THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CAST.EVERYONE IN MY HOUSE DROPS EVERYTHING WHEN WE PUT IN A DISK BECAUSE WE CAN WATCH THESE EPISODES OVER AND OVER. AWESOME.....
__label__2,Different direction in the T-Birds sound...: This 1997 release is a different direction in the T-Birds sound...much more sparse with a heavier emphasis on drums & bass. The band is also quite different with Danny Kortchmar on guitar and Steve Jordan on drums. Kim Wilson's vocals are as strong as ever.
__label__2,Off Tha Chain!!!: Marques Houston is very talented and Gorgeous!!! and Can Sing!!! This Album is HOT! just like all his albums even down to IMMATURE! Buy this album! you wont regret it! He is the sexiest man alive too!
__label__1,Poor Construction: This case has a great design but is very poorly constructed. The metal frame is very light guage and easily bent. I received this case in very bad condition. It had all six plastic mounting pins on the front broken off and the case was warped. One side had a bad bend on one corner. I feel sure it was shipped this way because there was a large peice of plastic wrapped around the box to hold it together. UPS may from time to time deliver damaged goods but they do not wrap a big peice of plastic around a box that is obviously dammaged. They have insurance and other ways to deal with this sort of thing.
__label__1,"Only the robot was likeable: Very disappointing. The only one worth liking was the poor robot that got the crap beat out of him. By the end, I don't even like the kid, as he was more about letting the robot fight than in finding any kind of 'friend' with the robot. Like dad like son. And Jackman's character had like only 1 redeeming quality. Even in the end the kid goes back to the sister-in-law and not with Jackman. So what is the point?"
__label__1,"Too small for Canon S5 IS: When I bought the camera Canon S5 IS the case showed up as recomended, but unfortunately it was too small for the camera."
__label__1,A clear look at Islam: A good resource to take you behind all the headlines and propaganda to the heart of Islam. The book is a thorough and clear presentation for those of us who know little about Islam. Plainly written and easy to search.
__label__1,"They do not fit: Despite the information given by WeatherTech on their website. These mats are notably too large for a 2010 Murano. Trimming them would not have solved the problem that the matching rear mats are much too small!Even more damning, when I attempted to return them directly to the manufacturer in Bollingbrook, IL, they wouldn't work with me and refused to accept them."
__label__2,"Enjoyable Book: This book takes the reader back to a simpler time when people travelled on foot or bicycle in their day-to-day business, creating opportunity for interactions with neighbors and the sharing of stories about the mysterious Lissergool ghost. Each story ends with a life-changing event that will delight and inform readers of all ages."
__label__2,"An amusing read in a field of boring instructionals: Over a decades has passed since I read this book, but it stands out in my memory for being as entertaining as it was informative. Marc's style of writing is easy to read and his books are genuinely amusing. I would suggest them over a lot of others in the field just for the fact that they will hold attention while others will either bore you to sleep or come off as just a lot of macho BS. Marc's gasconades ring true by contrast, and add spice to what otherwise might just be another boring instructional."
__label__2,very interesting book: I was all set to dislike this book ...but found it very interesting. It raises many interesting theories & points.
__label__1,"Try again: If you're seeking classical, you should probably stick with those known for their musical abilities/merits, and there are many choices that would supercede recordings such as this. Mr. Pratt has quite a way to go."
__label__2,A must-have book for little ones!: Little ones delight in the large colorful pictures of a loving mama duck with her five cute ducklings. The simple stories tickle even a young child's imagination. Any of the Little Quack books would belong in every child's collection.
__label__2,"One of Ms. Roberts' Best!: I hadn't read a Nora Roberts novel for many years but the title and cover of this one caught my attention so purchased it I was hooked from the very beginning! The location and family dynamics made it so interesting, not to mention what a great plot in a mystery with some romance thrown in."
__label__1,"does not work..junk: I got two of these from my Thank you Points reward network..same lights. The one came with a screw shaking loose inside but the real problem is that these flashlights lasted one day. They no longer hold a charge and when they did...not very bright. They are not true battery free shake lights. You can see the 3 little button cell batteries inside..and these are what I think was giving me the little bit of light at first..Absolute junk..cheap plastic feel, switch is cheap..nothing quality about it. Came with a box with typos all over it..not address of the company. Do not wasted your time or money on this junk."
__label__2,Ice cream bowls: The products I ordered where just as described and received undamaged.The arrived in a timely manner as well.
__label__1,"don't buy this book. Horrible: This book sucked. A complete waste of time for me. Hardly any of it was about marketing & promotion. It was basically a watered down rundown of how the industry works. If you want to know how the industry works, buy the Donald Passman book about it. For a GOOD book about Marketing & Promotion buy Gurilla PR by Levine instead."
__label__2,"Wonderful, just underappreciated.: I'll be honest, I only bought this CD because I am inlove with I Could Not Ask For More. But it's not even the best song on the CD. I can't believe how underappreciated Edwin McCain is. Words cannot express how lovely some of his songs are. I've taken to leaving the CD on while I go to sleep. Edwin McCain has a perfectly melofluous voice. Some songs(like Beautiful Life) are depressingly beautiful. Others(like Go Be Young) are just beautifully uplifting. He is a very inspiring singer. I can't wait to get his next album. Basically my point is BUY THE CD! If you like Sarah McLachlain(I hope I spelled that right), and Jewel, you will LOVE Edwin McCain. Have fun. And enjoy it."
__label__2,"Im happy with it: I like this set. It has alot of good stuff included. Just the fact alone that it's a bigger box then the Misfits' coffin box is pretty funny...seems like Glenn is just trying to slap the Misfits in the face by saying ""HA!, my set is bigger!"" The CDs sound good, but the video is kinda cheap. But for the price, you get alot of cool stuff. Misfits are better though."
__label__2,Cute game: This is a cute game. And this particular version of it with the metal tin is really neat. My 7 year old and I have been playing this game. He loves it. We love games and play all sorts of them. This was a nice addition to our collection.
__label__1,This thing is HUGE.: This is designed for a class set of Leap Pads-- not for home storage or travel. It is absolutely enormous. You could store 12 Leap Pads and a laptop in this.
__label__2,"Great compressor: This is a great little compact unit that fits in my trucks front box. So much lighter than my framing compressor, and for slamming in a few studs or running my pin nailer this was the ticket. It's design for the air outlet is great and the unit with it's low profile is stable. I have a lot of Dewalt tools and the brand has always worked to my expectations, I was confident with this recent addition to my tool box. And with the super saver shipping it was at the door in no time. I'm a bags on General Contractor and when tools don't work neither do I, buy this unit and you will like what you get.Shinn Construction Co, New Mexico USA."
__label__1,"Long on style but short on reality: This book did not live up to its promise. It's long on style but short on reality. Style in this case isn't such a good thing because what this author's sense of style conveys is design for design's sake instead of design for the sake of life. I find that more than a little sad. Perhaps this look play s in New York where image sometimes is m ore important than substance and where showiness counts, but it doesn't feel like a good fit west of the Hudson."
__label__2,"Why isn't this on DVD!?: I saw this on Cinemax a few years ago and loved it. Incredibly artistic, which I wasn't expecting, but was very delighted to find. I want this movie, but I no longer have a VCR! Put it on DVD!"
__label__1,"Did not know it was a concert series: I love Neil Diamond! However, I would not have ordered this collection had I known it was a live in concert version. I thought it was a studio version. If you want his best work, please look at the description carefully and make sure you get the hits made in the studio. Tis hard to sing along with this CD, as he ab libs so much."
__label__2,"Good idea, bad size: I think this is a great clamp for using as a straight edge, and it performs beautifully. The only think I would recommend is buying both the shorter version and the longer version than this halfway between size. This one is a little too long for going across boards, but too short to use on 4'x8' sheet goods. Otherwise a good investment."
__label__2,"A great puzzle game: This game is great! Each level is basically a puzzle -- you have to figure out how to modify the track to sort out marbles that you drop into the top. The levels start pretty simple but gradually work up to higher and higher levels of complexity. It sounds simple, but the higher levels are just mind-boggling!Kids and adults can all enjoy this, although kids may not get all the way through the levels. I'm not a child psychologist, but I'm sure this game will help your kids develop their problem-solving skills.I had this game years ago, but have lost my source disk, so was looking to replace it. Unfortunately, I don't know whether this will run on newer operating systems."
__label__2,"More fun than a barrel of monkeys!: This is also my first automatic ice cream freezer, and I am glad I chose this one. You do need to follow the directions and pre-freeze the container. In fact, after using, I immediately wash the freezer bowl, dry it well, and stick it back in the freezer so it is ready to go when I want to use it. I store any leftover ice cream in another container. That is, if I am lucky enough to have leftovers!The unit is a snap to put together, use, and wash.It is reasonably quiet to use as well.I found tons of recipes on the internet. So far, our favorite has been orange sherbet. Yes, it is cheaper to buy commericial and you do need to keep ingredients on hand and chilled, but well worth the effort!"
__label__1,"Brittle, bubbly, terrible.: I bought this topcoat at the drugstore when I left my other bottle of top coat (Seche Vite) at work. I love Sally Hansen products, and I've used the Dries Instantly top coat with no complaints at all. This one, however, was different. Quick-drying to a hard, shiny finish that began to crackle within 24 hours. Eventually it started to chip and crack right off, taking the polish with it. It also trapped little bubbles in it, no matter how hard I tried to apply it smoothly (I'm quite proud of home mani skills ... this wasn't all user error). The bubbles went all the way down to the nail as the top coat dried, and left my dark polish with tiny flesh-colored bubbles showing through! It's one of the very few items I've ever purchased that I was so disgusted with I marched right back to the store for a refund."
__label__1,"Chinese made, and everything that's come to mean...: In short, when you take the time to calibrate this unit, it seems ok, but it's very hard to calibrate, comes with illegible instructions that were written in Chinglish, and easily becomes uncalibrated (calibration screws are hard to fix in place)."
__label__2,"Easy to read, Good information, Funny and Entertaning: I disagree with the negative comments some others wrote about this book. Judging from what I see on the dating sites, a lot of people are going about this wrong. So, it is not outdated nor is it simple common sense that every one already knows. Instead it has relevant and useful tips on making your profile stand out. Your communications will be more effective and your online dating experience will be better overall. Lastly, he writes about all this with a great sense of humor."
__label__2,"Dr. Paul Chan: An interesting and easy to read book that explains the classic 36 strategies of ancient China, and uses extensive examples to illustrate the practical implementation of these strategies. If you are strategist and a ""The Art of War"" fan, then I highly recommend this book."
__label__2,"A Great Way to Get Started!: I've always been apprehensive about trying scrapbooking until I read this book. I was afraid I wasn't creative enough, or that I would ruin my pictures with the first cut. Ms. Barr gave me the confidence to trust my intuition and to just go for it. I'm already on my second scrapbook and I'm having a GREAT time! This book is easy to read and follow, and her page ideas are just great. I'm giving this book as Christmas gifts for everyone I know who wants to try scrapbooking."
__label__1,Bought 4 - 2 bad - no customer service available: Wanted the features and was willing to pay the price. Bought 4 - they programmed and installed easily. Went to test and 2 activated all 4 and 2 only activated themselves. Reprogrammed with same results.Went to the website - no customer service number. FAQ instructions were not complete (printed instructions were 95% government and lawyer inspired and 5 % useful but that is OK it was easy to install and configure. No customer service number! How can that be?Since these are critical the immediate faults DO NOT inspire confidence I packed them all up and sent them back.THANKS SO MUCH ecom for the easy return policy. Hope you bill your costs back to First Alert.Will try the Kidde but bummed they don't have a combo w/CO detection and wireless.
__label__2,"A great introduction: to the true online marketing superstars. Although no compilation of great interviews will provide you a single shot to success, Success Secrets will introduce you to those who will teach you how. Those like Jay Conrad Levinson, David Garfinkel and Joe Vitale, all of whom have incredible flocks of true believers. I know, because we publish for them at Morgan James Publishing. I am disappointed, however, that Armand Morin, Robert Anthony, Stephen Pierce and Ted Ciuba weren't included in the book."
__label__2,"THIS GAME IS IT!!!: I have always been a Madden fan, but when I found out that the XBox version would not have online capabilities, I was very disappointed. I had NFL Fever 2002, and was very impressed. But when I saw NFL 2K3 had signed a deal with ESPN, I was blown away. The place I get games from had it this past Tuesday, and no one else gets it until next week!! The Sega Sports Challenge alone is worth the game. I mean, NFL Fever was great, but how many times did the game allow you to burn the DB's??? If you want realism, this is the game. Also, hint, if you are an ESPN fan...LET THE GAME COMPLETELY LOAD UP!!!"
__label__2,"The tastiest: I believe, I bought this tea before under a different name and have been searching for it ever since. It's flavor is strong and sweet and wonderful. I would buy their spearmint tea along with it. I'm not sure they produce it any longer, but the I liked the spearmint even more. It had the same strength of flavor and sweetness. I highly recommend this product."
__label__1,"WTF: How many pieces come with in this order? It would be smart to list a quantity! I can get 16 of these in the store for under 3 dollars, but I want to by them in bulk. I make custom coasters and I use these on every piece I make.How much does $29 get me???C'mon ecom... you can do better than that!"
__label__2,"Large but very nice: I got this for my grandson's 4th birthday. He's very interested in space and wanted a helmet. This one is super cool but very large. His grandfather could also wear it with ease. They suggest padding it with foam, so we'll try that. But he was wearing it around and having fun opening and closing the visor at his party. Could hardly get him to take it off. He wants it for Halloween, and combined with the orange space suit, he should look very authentic."
__label__1,"great product....when it works.: I received this as my 40th birthday present from my wife and loved it right away. It was great until six months later when the screen went haywire. Lost the picture but had vertical lines up and down, stuck on.Palm sent me a refurbished unit that died within 2 months. Screen failed to come on.Palm sent me another refurbished unit (that was pretty beat up) but I cannot use the keyboard to enter text into a DateBook line item. The cursor jumps to top everytime. Others have had this problem as I've read on a Palm Tungsten Forum.Palm is sending me another refurbished unit. This will be my 4th and I'll sell this one and get another brand.Pretty disappointed with Palm."
__label__2,"I Did Love This Game..But...............: I really liked this game, and the mystery behind it, but the only reason I gave it a four instead of a five, was the ending...I won't give it away, but I was disappointed!! Other than that, it was great!!!"
__label__2,"effective and convenient: PUR is a great filter. I prefer this model because it holds a lot, and yet seems out of the way."
__label__1,Hard to follow without verbal cues: This set comes with very thorough step-by-step introduction from Seane Corn taking you through each part of the routine. The problem is when you move onto the second DVD which offer the full series and flow from one position to next. There is no verbal cue or voice-over to guide you. It's simply Sean moving through the sequence silently. In order to follow her you have to constantly look up at the screen. I find it all very distracting and it takes away from me being able to focus on my poses.
__label__2,Life Saving Information: This book may save you life. Stress has been shown to be related to so many diseases (dis-ease) that after reading this book you will avoid stress like you would the plague and take it easy rather than go for dis-ease.
__label__2,"Slide Copier: Just as the film copying system previously rated, this too was purchased to record priceless slide film assemblies prior to the Digital Camera era. Was time consuming but worked to archive those precious memories."

The rest of the cd isntt to bad.He has a flow which is a singing and rapping style that sounds like nelly. ""were my huslas at?""s the only reason i brought the cd. That song is super crunk. Down load it off the internet or somthing. You have to hear it. Also the cd is about 7 or 8 songs, it could of been longer and some of the songs sound a lil dated now."

__label__2,"Very Handy: This is a very handy coffee plunger. The coffee stays hot for ages. Also great for camping as there is no breakable parts. This is also a good price, I saw the same item at a coffee shop that was $20 dearer. They should make a bigger one too!Thermos Nissan 34-Ounce Vacuum Insulated Stainless-Steel Gourmet Coffee Press"
__label__2,"Vampira: The Movie Best Ever Horror Documentary: Vampira: The Movie is the Best Ever Horror Documentary. Featuring stars such as Vampira (Maila Nurmi)herself, along with Forrest Ackerman, Sid Haig, Count Smokula (My personal favorite) and Jerry Only, among others. This movie is a hot commodity as it is the last documentary about Maila before her passing in January 2008.This showcases how caring and loving Maila Nurmi was as a human being and as an artist. RIP MAILA ELIZABETH NURMI."
__label__1,Dullsville.: This cd is extremely dull and boring and just about the worst effort the talented Miss Flack ever put forth. Stick with her 70's work over this waste of time.
__label__1,"how dare she: i love jasper johns, how dare she degrade this man. is she jealous? hahaha.i bet so.he is one of the twelve riches artist in america. one of the twelve that gets his money. not like some good artist who dont see much of their money...i have more to say, but dont know how to post."
__label__1,"Put on your thinking cap.: The newspaper reviews led me to buy this book. It is far beyond my novice capability to comprehend. I think four years of college is not quite enough education to grasp this theory. Not a ""Physics for Dummies"" type of book."
__label__1,BORING: This book was the worst book I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had to read this book for school and it's 507 pages of dull.I highly recommend to you not to read this book!
__label__1,"Liar Liar Revisionism On Fire!: Oh! ...what a sad and nutty tale twas this, to be sure! Talk about having the fox investigating the chicken coop, WOW!For a POINT BY POINT analysis of the numerous fabrications and omissions in the Kean/Zelikow report, please read David Ray Griffin's follow up book to his ""The New Pearl Harbor""(referencing the Project For A New American Century) titled, ""9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions"".Also, (...)watch the Booknotes special they did covering Griffin's presentation at two day event at the U of Madison, Wis, a few weeks back, where some four-hundred and fifty people gave him a lengthy standing ovation.Guess all of those good, common folk(and millions of others)are merely a bunch of easily led, voice-hearing, looney UFO conspiracy wingnuts, right? Afterall, they should mindlessly accept the fact that - okay, open your mind real wide now - their government would NEVER lie about anything, and we actually exist within a democracy! Right?"
__label__1,changing edition: you are not good becuase you changed my order last time. i ordered forth edition and you sent third edition
__label__1,"Terrible Book.: I bought this book for reference purposes for things I may have forgotten, that I learned long ago.Anyone that buys this book to learn electronics will not learn very much and will in all likelihood end up not understanding electronics.Terrible writer."
__label__1,"Not A Good Purchase: Only one half of the product worked the first time we tried it. It was also very cheaply made and loud. I called the company, and they did agree to send me a replacement. When the replacement came it started to smoke as soon as I turned it on (thank God I tried it before I decided to use it!). On top of that the company wrote that it was an adult novelty product right on the package when they shipped it (so much for ""discreet"" packaging!). The company offered that I could choose any product from their website as an apology. Unfortunately, there were no prices anywhere....I didn't want to get something worth $5, so I asked them to send another Adonis to me. I turned it on, and it didn't smoke, but I really have no desire to use it after the grief it's caused me. I was incredibly disappointed with how cheaply made this product was, and will never order a Berman product again."
__label__2,"Perfect replacement, and significant savings: I purchased this battery for my APC 1400 SmartUPS. In the past, I have bought from a local battery manufacturer. However, the cost of this battery was $20 cheaper, and the shipping was free with my Prime account. Add the convenience of having it delivered to my door, and it is a much better option. Final point - when I buy the replacement cells locally, I get two individual batteries, and then I have to fix them together and add the terminals from the old batteries. This unit came with the cells already configured and new terminals attached. Great product!"
__label__2,"Elvis at His Best!: If you want one DVD for your collection pick this one up as The King is at the top with his band in beautiful Hawaii. There is a well chosen concert selection of his love ballads,hits, and prime rock & roll choices for all. The crowd really is in to the concert and Elvis is the only true King of Rock & Roll. The DVD is crisp with excellant camera angles and a top notch soundtrack from a recording that is over 25 years old. A great job was done remastering from the orginal tapes. Sit back ,relax and enjoy but you most likely will be dancing and singing along! I know I did!"
__label__1,"Used Kindle Wireless Reading Device: The used Kindle wireless reading device I ordered from Amizon was mailed by the owner. It arrived within the stated time. However, the previous owner did not pack the product properly and, as a result, it arrived in a broken and defective condition. I have tried to contact Amizon and the company that Amizon's web site referred me to. Neither has contacted me back or done anything to alleviate the problem. It has been a very frustrating experience."
__label__1,"This is NOT the blues king Peter Green!: If you love the blues, stay away from this! This has been mistakenly linked to the name of Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green. This is some other guy with the same name, not the blues genius. This is some sort of experimental techno junk, and any blues fan who buys it will regret having spent the money for ""music"" not even Yoko Ono would claim. I made the mistake. Don't let this happen to you."
__label__2,Wool rug Hooking: This is a very informative book on how to begin from start to finish wool rug hooking. Very good illustrations.
__label__2,"Great game.: There were a few stickers on the cartridge, but it's alright because the game worked fine and it's such a fun game when you're on multiplayer mode."
__label__2,"Excellent product: A long time ago my husband and I used one of those water jet tooth brushes. I liked the way it cleaned but it was kind of a hassle to prep and clean. For some reason we retired it and never went back. We got two Sonicare toothbrushes on my dentists recommendation a year ago because regualr brushing was wearing down my tooth enamel at the gum line. The design is very well thought out, reasonably comfortable to use, and from my recent dentist vist -- results are good too. There are a couple of things I'd like to see impoved some how: easier cleaning of the inside of the handle and brush where they attach, and lower the cost of the replacement brushes. Over all, though, its a top notch product. Like others have said, I also like the 2 minute pacing timer."
__label__1,Not even a guide: This book isn't even a guide. All it does is direct you to links. Why couldn't they have just put all the stuff on Play-Online into this book? Play-Online is slower that a jack-rabbit on Tuesday. Brady needs to hire David Cassady back to write the FF series guides.
__label__1,Very Unsafe! Do Not buy!: My daughter is 18 lbs. She was in the Linkadoos Swing when she bent over to grab one of the Linkadoo toys attached to the swing and her head became stuck in between the legs. She had a red mark on her head for a couple of days. I recommend buying the Ocean Cradle Swing! My daughter loves it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
__label__2,GOOD CAM: Hey Guys this is a nice cam to use.I like this cam its clear to use the clarity of cam is excellent
__label__1,"Not worth buying... F-: WORTHLESS!!! They couldn't get the seam to be the same thickness. It is thicker so every time the seam hits your piece you are sanding it actually knocks it away from the sander. Worst sanding belt I have ever used. I have a 3"" belt sander so I normally cut a slice in the middle of a 6"" belt and tear a into 2 3"" wide pieces. That is how I have done it for 12 years. These would not tear evenly down the middle and ended up with an offset to it. Which while I was using it the edge caught on the piece I was sanding and ripped off the edge and came around and whipped my arm lacerating it quite badly. If I didn't have super glue readily available I probably would have needed stitches. I now have a 3"" scar on my arm due to these shoddy worthless belts. Not to mention that it gouged the piece I was sanding. I have thrown them away as that is the only place they belong. In the trash."
__label__2,"Suprisingly enchanting: The characters were quite interesting and full of life. The acting was amazing. And it was a very good story to follow. Great movie, two thumbs up."
__label__1,"Very little new and a LOT of the old: The book has a glimmer of new information. I do believe Mr. Kiyosaki is correct, there will be a boom and then a great crash in the market in the near future. The book is a warning to the Baby Boomer's generation. The message is: Wake up and smell the coffee and take care of your own finances before it's too late. That, in a nutshell, is the only new info in this book.The rest of the book is a re-hash of Mr. Kiyosaki's first series of books. This book has the same ""vagueness"" as his other books. It tells you to become an investor without telling you what to look for in a good investment. It tells you to buy real estate without giving you a clue on how to search for a good piece of property. Then there is the sales pitch for the over priced Cash Quadrant game...Please save your money."
__label__1,"Really bad: Were scenes deleted out of this movie because one scene after another didn't make sense. The dialog was all over the place, the acting was terrible, the college guy looked like he's 40, and Kelly Clarkson is in it for some reason."
__label__1,"Handbook of Today's Religions: McDowell's purpose may be noble in writing this book, but sadly it is very one-sided and based on his own perspective and interpretation of biblical sources. This book sadly fails to inform. It prohibits dialogue between the various traditions of the world, which would have and certainly does sadden God. The book is ignorance defined, I am afraid, and I would have hoped for more from the author. However, when one person or group decides they have a monopoly on the truth, then books such as this are the result. I would say this to any person of any faith who wrote a book so dismissive of traditions besides its own, so this is not simply as dismissal of a Christian author. Mr. McDowell should be ashamed of this book. I am ashamed for him."
__label__2,"Yes, these have the original opening theme and music: So glad to finally have these on DVD with the original opening theme and music, uncut. Picture quality isn't fantastic, but is very good (I seem to remember the show always looking like this, with a sort of grainy '70s look to it, even when originally broadcast).I loved this show as a kid and for some reason the synth score would creep me out, not sure why.Extras include two of Alan Landsberg's other movies (pre-In Search Of I believe) and the Mitch Pileggi episodes from the early 2000s.If you liked the show as a kid, I highly recommend picking this up. It's one of my all-time favorites and I'm very, very glad to have it on DVD now."
__label__2,Garmin StreetPilot c320 GPS Vehicle Navigator: One of the best items I have ever purchased. There is no way you can get lost with this thing! I loaded the whole US and Canada on a 2 gig sd with 1 gig left over.
__label__1,"Small, fragile: I ordered the largest size they offer (3.5 to 4 inches). The sponge was much more of an irregular shape than the picture shown here. The four inches is measured from tip-to-tip of the longest possible dimension. Measuring 90 degrees from that, the sponge I got was only about two inches wide.The sponge lasted just six weeks before falling apart. At $13.45 (with shipping) this is way too expensive. You can getLATHER Natural Sea Wool Spongeshipped for $14 and that is huge. You could cut that up to make at least four decent sized sponges considerably larger than this one. (I say four only to be on the conservative side.)While it lasted, though, it was very nice."
__label__2,Honest & sweet: This movie has heart & touches anyone who has found themselves out of work due to their lack of education. It is well-written & easy to watch & enjoy.
__label__2,"Just about brilliant: Great characters. Good art. At times maybe the funniest strip out there. The creator takes a risk by combining the tools used by the left, (irony and snarky sarcasim), on the right for years. It works. And if you go to the Bonus Features online by using the password provided in the book you can read some of the hate mail Prickly City gets to prove just how effectively it gets under the other sides skin."
__label__2,"I love Pessoa as much as the next guy.: Really, it's true. Like the old saying goes, if I could teach myself Portugese I would never leave the house. While I must leave my compass screwed into its niche at the end of my trusty commando knife, purchased from ""Oriental Imports"" at the mall when I was 12, that is to say many years ago, and certainly not yesterday, I am not lost. No sir, these things are not lost on me with or without that compass, even as I travel, knifeless across these fine United States, chilled by the long shadow cast by Borges. Sound on Sound huh? Well, I know this much-- it shouldn't be left to wither, nor disappeared in the night like so many Arab-Americans in recent years."
__label__1,"Bad: Well now, this is by far the worst Star Trek movie ever. The movie is so innacurate, such as how the Enterprise made it to the center of the galaxy, over 30,000 light years away, in under a few hours. You watch shows like Star Trek Voyager, where the ship is stranded 70,000 light years away from Earth, and the trip will take decades. The Enterprise-A is a much older and slower ship than Voyager, and it should take them decades to reach the center of the galaxy, not hours.The innacuracies is not the only thing, I cannot think of anything more dumb than a ""god search"" by a Vulcan on Star Trek! I have been a Star Trek fan for a very long time, but even as a fan, I must say that this movie does not portray the Star Trek franchise in a very good way at all."
__label__2,"Excellent instruction for the Illustrator 9 beginner.: If you've had no previous exposure to Illustrator at all, and want to find the quickest and easiest way to start learning the program from scratch, this is your book! The lessons are easy to follow, and give you a good grasp on how Illustrator's many tools and functions work. This is the best book I've found for getting an introduction to using the program. By the time you finish it, you'll have a good enough understanding of the program to begin learning Illustrator's more advanced features. This book is written for the complete Illustrator novice, so if you're looking for a more in depth guide to all of what Illustrator 9 has to offer, this book isn't what you're looking for. But if you want a fast, effective, and fun intro to the program, get yourself this book."
__label__2,"My Only Complain: Finally this excellent tv series in on DVD. My only complain is that they should have issued the three seasons at the same time. I have the feeling that if this one does not sell well, they will not issue season 2 and season 3. Also no extras, no scene selection. This was done without any care for the fans. Apparently the people originally involved in the creation of the series have nothing to say or contribute to the product.AGD"
__label__1,"Doesn't Make the Grade; Not a Bang - Just a Whimper: When Mr. Burnside first got this book published back in 1999, it was probably the best book on the subject, and helpful to consumers. The truth is, though, it is embarrassing by almost any standard today. The editing is non-existent, and that just shows the lack of thought that went into this. It was thrown together, and omits more than it conveys. There are far better choices now; most notably Wes Johnson's ""The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook"" that just came out. The latter is an outstanding book, well-researched, far more thorough, and much easier to read. It will also save you more money than any other book on the subject that I've read. If you're thinking about buying a manufactured home, do yourself a favor and buy ""The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook"" instead. You'll be glad you did before the ink on the contract dries!"
__label__2,Positive Read: A positive read to help you attract the things in life that make you happy and not drag you down.Great advice and inspirational read!
__label__2,"classic tlc: What more could be said about this album that hasn't been said it? T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli delivered a classic that'll be remembered forever with tracks like ""Red Light Special"", ""Creep"", ""Waterfalls"", ""Case Of The Fake People"", and ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"", RIP Left Eye!!"
__label__2,"Another Ozark Classic: With Don't Look Down The Ozarks released another classic album in 1977. This is once again country/pop rock at it's very best.Any album with a song like ""Giving it all to the wind"" on it is a classic. Everytime friends of mine who don't know The Ozarks hear this beautiful Larry Lee song they are completely blown away by it. The rest of the songs are far above standard country rock quality. Why these guys weren't as popular like The Eagles is still one of the great mysteries of the 70's !! There are 3 bonus tracks on this cd version: ""Sweetwood"" is one of them and is one of the best ballads ever to have been released by The Ozarks. Talking about quality control.......this track was never released until now !!So once again.........go out and buy this album !!!PS; Some more good news; The CBS album from 1980 will als be released by the good people of New Era in november 2005 !Greetings to all Ozark fans,Martin from Holland"
__label__2,Buffalo Valley: I was very pleased with the condition of this item. I have never ordered used books online before but I figured what would it hurt because they were for my mother and my mother buys all of her books at book sales and garage sales. If all of the used books I order are in this condition I will definitely keep getting them this way. Thanks!
__label__1,"NO CHAPTER DIVISION: It's a GREAT book by Bunyan. But as the title says, that is a huge drawback of this book to me personally."
__label__2,"Very PLeased and Happy: The material was shipped and I received it within three days of me ordering it. It was received as stated and in a timely manner. Thank you, very much. It has been nice doing business with you."
__label__2,Very Helpful: Although I have a gram index on my tone arm this was very helpful to dial the stylus weight in and confirm.
__label__1,"Scratched up cd: When I got this cd and played it, it was already scrached up, I tryed playing it and a few songs wouldnyt even play"
__label__2,"...in a few words, But Great Insight!: I was intrigued by the title of this book and once opened it was a like a cool breeze on a summer day. As a veteran designer I found myself nodding the head with affirmation. What is contained in the book is pretty simple; just read the description. The quotes, tips and insights are well worth remembering whether you are a designer or a client. Thought provoking for those serious about design."
__label__1,"You get what you pay for: I bought this after reading 2 reviews on ecom which were favorable. It skipped CDs after 4 months in my office. Sounds great, looks great... but rate it zero for durability. The repair or shipping for repairs will probably cost at least half the buying price. Disappointed."
__label__2,"Really Cool and Easy to use!: Third digital camera and by far the best so far! Great pics indoors or out and really easy to use. The all metal body is very durable and small in size, fits in shirt pocket. I'm six foot 3 inches and I don't have a problem in operating the buttons. For the price this is now selling you can't go wrong, if you want a great pocket camera at a great price buy now before they are gone!..................=D"
